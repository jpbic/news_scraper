daily_wire|"On Tuesday, in a speech before the Senate Rules Committee, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell blasted the so-called ""For the People Act,"" snapping that the Democrats"" actions were an attempt to ""hotwire our democracy itself without a single vote from the other side."" McConnell began, ""We""ll hear a lot of flowery language today, including my friend and colleague the Majority Leader, but we all learned early in life if you can write the rules, you can win the game."" ""If you can write the rules, you can win the game,"" he repeated. ""For multiple years now, not just this year, but for multiple years now, Democrats have called this sweeping bill their top priority. You just heard the Majority Leader make a totally partisan speech about it. There""s nothing bipartisan about this: this was cooked up at the Democratic National Committee and designed to advantage one side to the disadvantage of the other. The substance of the legislation actually hasn""t changed over the years, but the supposed rationales have changed constantly."" McConnell then pointed out that the attempt to institute sweeping voting changes empowering Democrats began after former President Trump""s election in 2016. ""In 2016, American voters made a presidential decision the Democrats didn""t like,"" he said. ""This legislation was cooked up at that particular point and presented as a massive overhaul, an emergency repair job for a broken democracy. That""s what it was back then. Last autumn voters made a decision Democrats liked a lot better. Suddenly their side stopped calling our democracy broken. Now our democracy was beyond reproach."" ""But curiously enough, the Democrats want the exact same sweeping bill just as desperately,"" McConnell continued. ""The truth is quite simple: our democracy is not in crisis and we aren""t going to let one party take over democracy over the false pretense of saving it. Voter turnout in November blew 2016 and 2018 out of the water. The 2020 election saw the highest turnout in decades. The hysterical attacks the political Left has thrown at the new election law in Georgia, for example, have been thoroughly debunked by fact-checkers. African-American turnout last fall was twice as high in Mississippi as it was in Massachusetts."" ""None of the shifting, made-up rationales for this sweeping set of changes hold any water at all,"" McConnell charged. ""So why are our friends on the other side so desperate to push it through? Why are Democrats so hell bent on doing whatever it takes to rewire our democracy on a thoroughly partisan basis?"" McConnell then got specific about the ""partisan"" nature of the bill and the ""ludicrous practices"" it enshrined: Let""s take a look at the bill. This legislation would let Washington Democrats dictate the terms of their own reelection races by rewriting all 50 states"" election laws. Popular safeguards, like voter ID, would be neutered. Ludicrous practices, like ballot harvesting, would be mandatory coast-to-coast. Democrats have a narrow majority in the House and a 50-50 Senate, but they want to make themselves the board of elections for every county and state in America? But voting regulations are just the start; this legislation would deliberately turn the Federal Elections Commission into a partisan Democratic panel. They want their own side enforcing election law on their own unilaterally. They would authorize federal bureaucrats to poke around in a much broader slice of private citizens"" free speech. They would attack Americans"" privacy right so such an extreme degree that even the liberal ACLU is sounding alarm bells about this bill. It would have the federal government take public money and send it directly to political campaigns so Americans can subsidize robocalls, junk mail, and TV ads for candidates they disagree with. ""So the market has changed constantly; this has gone from an election security bill to an ethics bill to a racial justice bill,"" McConnell noted. ""Who knows what it will be labeled tomorrow? But what doesn""t change is the substance because the intention doesn""t change. The Democratic Party, on its own, wants to rewrite the ground rules of American politics for their benefit."" ""We all know that""s what this is about,"" he said. ""It""s hard to imagine anything that would erode public confidence in our democracy more drastically. This bill has purely partisan support in the House; it had bipartisan opposition. It""s one thing to make fiscal policy that way, to use reconciliation to tax and to spend; it""s very different to try to hotwire our democracy itself without a single vote from the other side."" McConnell pointed out that decades before, Democrats and Republicans worked together on voting issues. ""These are issues we""ve tackled together in the past; I was first chair and ranking member with Chris Dodd in 2001 and 2002. We passed a Help America Vote Act with 90 votes. The slogan then was ""Make it easier to vote and harder to cheat."" On a bipartisan basis we resisted the pleas of some to federalize every aspect of how we handle elections. We set up the Federal Election Administration Act; we provided money to help states upgrade their equipment; but we deliberately did not seek to dictate how they handle elections."" He concluded, ""That""s how you pass a bill related to how the two parties compete: together, not on a totally partisan basis. That""s how you strengthen our democracy. If this bill were to pass nobody would have any confidence in it, none whatsoever. Let""s call it what it is; put aside the flowery language. This is a partisan effort to take over how you conduct elections in our country."" In early March, former Vice President Mike Pence published an op-ed for the Heritage Foundation in which he likewise strongly criticized the bill: The bill would force states to adopt universal mail-in ballots, early voting, same-day voter registration, online voter registration, and automatic voter registration for any individual listed in state and federal government databases, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles and welfare offices, ensuring duplicate registrations and that millions of illegal immigrants are quickly registered to vote. States would be required to count every mail-in vote that arrives up to 10 days after Election Day. States must also allow ballot harvesting—where paid political operatives collect absentee ballots from places such as nursing homes—exposing our most vulnerable voters to coercion and increasing the risk that their ballots will be tampered with. At the same time, state and local election officials would be stripped of their ability to maintain the accuracy of voter rolls, barred from verifying voter eligibility, and voter ID would be banned from coast to coast. Congressional districts would be redrawn by unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats. Illegal immigrants and law-abiding American citizens would receive equal representation in Congress. Felons would be able to vote the moment they set foot out of prison.

daily_wire|"The Kansas Legislature voted to override Democratic Governor Laura Kelly""s veto of a couple of election reform bills Monday. Inspired by controversies from the 2020 election, the bills aimed to prevent similar fights from taking place in future elections. Kelly vetoed the bills last month claiming that the legislation was ""designed to disenfranchise Kansans,"" according to the Kansas City Star . Republican state Sen. Caryn Tyson rejected the governor""s characterization of the bills and said the new legislation would secure ""voter accuracy"" in later elections: ""Every single vote matters and the accuracy matters. This bill is not about voter suppression it is about voter accuracy and making sure every legal vote counts."" The Star described each bill: House Bill 2332 prohibits the executive and judicial branches of government from altering election laws. It also prevents the Secretary of State from entering into consent decrees with a court without legislative approval. … House Bill 2183 focuses largely on mail-in voting. It limits who is permitted to return a mail-in ballot for another person and makes it a misdemeanor for one person to return more than 10 mail-in ballots. The measure also requires the signature on a mail ballot to match the signature election officials have on file, creating a potential for votes to be discarded, and bans the Secretary of State from extending mail-in vote deadlines. The bill also makes it illegal to backdate a postmark on a ballot and bars election offices from accepting money from any entity other than the state for administering elections. Republicans in many states have pushed new election integrity measures since the 2020 election to restore trust in elections and prevent a number of issues that came up amid the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, executives and courts made changes to state election laws while bypassing the legislature. Republican Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signed legislation in March reforming Georgia""s election laws after his state received national scrutiny during the 2020 election. As The Daily Wire reported at the time: The legislation seeks to tighten up elections and reduce fraud by enforcing conformity across the state, amping up voter ID, restricting drop boxes, and expanding in-person voting, among additional election-related overhauls. ""With Senate Bill 202, Georgia will take another step toward ensuring our elections are secure, accessible and fair,"" Kemp said Thursday. ""Ensuring the integrity of the ballot box isn""t partisan, it""s about protecting the very foundation of who we are as Georgians and Americans."" Democrats and large corporations have ripped the new Georgia laws. Major League Baseball (MLB) went as far as pulling its 2021 all-star game and draft out of the state in protest of the election integrity measures, drawing backlash from Georgians, including local Democrats. Kemp later ripped Democrats and the MLB for caving to ""cancel culture"" while lying about what the election reforms actually do. ""It""s unfortunate that Major League Baseball has caved to the cancel culture, and quite honestly, President Biden and Stacey Abrams and a lot of other people are simply lying about this bill to pressure these organizations,"" Kemp said in an April appearance on Fox News. ""This is just a cancel culture, and I""ll tell you, the people at home should be scared because their ballgame is next, their business will be next, their way of life will be next. It is time to stand up and fight this and say, ""look, we""re not going to take this anymore."" It""s ridiculous.""

daily_wire|"Despite pushback from the Left, the state song of Kentucky will be played before tomorrow""s Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs. ""My Old Kentucky Home,"" written by Stephen Foster, is reported to have been first played at the race in 1921, and has been played at Churchill Downs every year since. The beloved song has come under fire as of late. According to Newsweek , ""while some people consider the song to be a powerful condemnation of slavery,"" others have a problem with ""its original title and lyrics, and the contexts in which it has been performed, including at minstrel shows."" Smithsonian Magazine described the song as ""a condemnation of Kentucky""s enslavers who sold husbands away from their wives and mothers away from their children,"" and as ""the lament of an enslaved person who has been forcibly separated from his family and his painful longing to return to the cabin with his wife and children."" Louisville-born historian Emily Bingham told WPFL ahead of last year""s Kentucky Derby that the song was ""written by a white man about a black person being sold down river from Kentucky to the deep south to be sung by white men pretending to be black men on stages for white audiences."" Last year""s Kentucky Derby, held on Labor Day Weekend due to the COVID-19 pandemic, used a modified version of the song, performed by a bugler without lyrics, and preceded by a moment of silence. The change to the presentation of the song was due to the social justice protests taking place at the time surrounding the death of Breonna Taylor. WLKY first reported that the song will be played as usual this year. However, Churchill Downs reportedly did not indicate whether, this year, any changes to the rendition would be made. Pastor Timothy Findley of the Kingdom Life Center has called on Churchill Downs to make changes to the song. ""If we""re going to do the right thing, if we""re going to do the thing that moves our community forward, moves our city forward, and shows that we have sensitivity to what has happened in the past and a mind to move forward in the future, the song needs to be removed,"" Findley told WLKY on Thursday. ""I don""t even understand why this is such a difficult thing."" Yes. The Daily Wire is covering sports – without the woke. Want more? Become a member. This is not the first time the Left has sought to make changes to sports and the traditions surrounding them. In 2017, the NBA moved its All-Star game out of Charlotte after North Carolina passed the ""bathroom bill."" The NFL, after many years of attempting to get the Washington Redskins to change their name, finally succeeded in 2020 and owner Dan Snyder made the decision to rename the franchise the ""Washington Football Team."" Just this month, Major League Baseball bowed down to the woke Left and moved their 2021 All-Star game and 2021 MLB Draft out of Atlanta after a backlash to Georgia""s election integrity laws — a move applauded by many on the Left.

There""s no better way for America""s pastime to honor the great Hank Aaron, who always led by example. — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) April 3, 2021 Even the 2021 Masters tournament at Augusta National was under siege. After President Biden called the Georgia bill ""Jim Crow on steroids,"" calls for the tournament to be moved from Georgia grew.

daily_wire|"Thursday night, history giant and student of current affairs Jimmy Kimmel, of late-night fame, decided to take a stab at ripping South Carolina GOP Senator Tim Scott after Scott delivered a rebuttal to President Joe Biden""s State of the Union address and insisted that America is not a racist country. Kimmel mocked Scott by pointing out that Scott is the only black GOP U.S senator and thus had no right to assume the GOP isn""t racist, taunting, ""An amazing thing happened after the speech. Every black Republican senator got together to let the American people know the Republican party isn""t racist."" Kimmel played a clip of Scott""s rebuttal in which Scott stated, ""By doubling down on the divisions we""ve worked so hard to heal. You know this stuff is wrong. Hear me clearly. America is not a racist country."" Kimmel mocked, ""And then Tim promptly returned to the sensory deprivation egg he calls home. Senator Scott accused Democrats, in his rebuttal, of using race as a weapon, when the truth is we""re more concerned about people using weapons as a weapon. Race would be a terrible weapon. What would you do, melanin a person to death?"" How many of the 50 Democratic Senators are black? @JimmyKimmel on @SenatorTimScott : ""Every black Republican Senator got together to let the American people know the Republican Party isn""t racist….And then Tim promptly returned to the sensory deprivation egg"" #Kimmel (Answer: 2) pic.twitter.com/3OgrnZI87s — Brent Baker (@BrentHBaker) April 30, 2021 Kimmel, of course, ignored the fact that his party of choice, the Democratic Party, has a whopping total of two black senators, Cory Booker of New Jersey and newly-elected Raphael Warnock of Georgia. As for Kimmel""s mockery of Scott""s contention that Democrats use race as a weapon, the clip he played was not where Scott referred to Democrats using race as a weapon; moreover, the clip revolved around Scott speaking of all Americans. Kimmel conveniently elided the statements Scott made immediately preceding the clip, in which Scott stated, ""When America comes together, we""ve made tremendous progress. But powerful forces want to pull us apart."" When Scott did indeed refer to race being used as a weapon, he was referring to Democrats and their attacks on the GOP as the GOP attempts to clean up elections. He said: The state of Georgia passed a law that expands early voting; preserves no-excuse mail-in voting; and, despite what the President claimed, did not reduce Election Day hours. If you actually read this law, it""s mainstream. It will be easier to vote early in Georgia than in Democrat-run New York. But the Left doesn""t want you to know that. They want people to virtue-signal by yelling about a law they haven""t even read. Fact-checkers have called out the White House for misstatements. The President absurdly claims this is worse than Jim Crow. What is going on here? I""ll tell you. A Washington power grab. This misplaced outrage is supposed to justify Democrats"" sweeping bill that would take over elections for all 50 states; send public funds to political campaigns you disagree with; and make the bipartisan Federal Elections Commission… partisan! This is not about civil rights or our racial past. It""s about rigging elections in the future. And, no — the same filibuster that President Obama and President Biden praised when they were Senators, that Democrats used just last year, has not suddenly become a racist relic just because the shoe is on the other foot.

daily_wire|"Jake Bequette has a story unlike any other. From playing with Tom Brady on Super Bowl winning teams, to joining the famed 101st Airborne Division, his life has been one of service, sacrifice, and devotion. The Daily Wire sat down with the former New England Patriot and United States Army veteran to discuss his time in the NFL, his transition into the military, and the woke Left""s influence in sports DAILY WIRE: I want to start with your story a little bit. I think a lot of our viewers are interested in professional players and how they got to that point. So for you, were you a big recruit coming out of high school in Arkansas? JAKE BEQUETTE: Not at all. I was very fortunate and very blessed to be able to receive a scholarship offer from the University of Arkansas. I come from a bit of a Razorback legacy. My grandfather, dad and uncle all played football at the University of Arkansas before me. But by no means was I a big time recruit. When I got a scholarship offer from Houston Nutt (former coach at Arkansas) in 2006, I accepted it immediately. I didn""t want him to change his mind and resend it. DW: You were drafted by the New England Patriots out of college. What was that like for you to be drafted by an organization with such a winning pedigree? Yes. The Daily Wire is covering sports – without the woke. Want more? Become a member. BEQUETTE: It was amazing.I""ll never forget receiving the call from Mr. Kraft and coach Belichick on draft night in 2012. And that was one of the best nights of my life with my family, my grandparents right here in Little Rock, Arkansas. And just to go to such a storied and amazing championship dynasty, that the New England Patriots are. I learned so much while I was there for those four years. It""s beyond football, beyond the on the field of stuff. It was the lessons of leadership, the lessons of organizational management, how coach Belichick and Mr. Kraft and the staff in New England behave. It""s no accident that year in year out over decades, they put together winning teams and championship teams. And those lessons of leadership that I learned from him, I""ll carry on for the rest of my life. DW: When you talk about Tom Brady, we""ve watched him for so long now and he continues to win championships. Do you have anything about Brady that you saw when you were in New England as far as the kind of energy and dedication he brings to the practice field? BEQUETTE: Yeah, it started on my first day. What I always tell people is that Tom Brady""s value to a team goes far beyond his tactical ability, if you will, as a quarterback. I remember my first ever team meeting we had, it was back in April or May of 2012, my rookie season. It was the first day of spring mini camp and the whole team was in the film room and coach Belichick was kind of going over his expectations for the team and probably given the same speech that he had given 20 times that Tom Brady had heard 20 times at the beginning of a football season or the beginning of that offseason. But I remember Tom Brady, his seat in the team meeting room was front row center. And I remember looking down for my seat kind of in the back on the right, he was kind of hunched over in his chair, and just scribbling furiously, every word that coach Belichick was saying. He was hanging on every word. He was trying to dissect what Coach Belichick expectations were, he was just trying to glean any bit of insight or wisdom from what Coach Belichick was saying. And it was like that every single meeting — that attention to detail. And I think the takeaway was clear to everyone sitting in that room, everyone behind or around Tom Brady. And they can see coach Belichick speaking, but they can also see Tom, just taking notes and being engaged. And it""s just that unspoken leadership that really set the tone and the tempo for every one of the 53 guys on the roster. And I think that""s one of the reasons why that success that surrounded Brady in New England, transferred with him to Tampa Bay. DW: A couple questions on Belichick? Obviously, he""s a little bit of a dry guy, a little ornery if you will. Is he like that in real life? Or is that a bit of a show for the media? BEQUETTE: It""s a little bit of both. He does actually have a really good sense of humor. It""s a very dry sense of humor. But he""s actually quite self deprecating and can make fun of himself. He can loosen up a little bit behind the scenes and make guys laugh. But ultimately, he has that entire locker room, that entire organization marching to the beat of the same drum. And it""s the tone that he sets for that organization. And even though there is a bit of levity, and there is some humor, it""s all business around there. And there""s a reason why that team has put up, you know, 10 and 12 wins seasons, division championships almost every single season. DW: Let""s talk about that about your transition after football. For a lot of athletes, it can be difficult. Your entire life has revolved around sports. Was it difficult for you to leave the game? Did you kind of know what you were trying to do after sports? Ronald C. Modra/Getty Images BEQUETTE: Well, I""ve been very blessed. It is difficult for an athlete to turn the page, to close that chapter of his life. But I""ve been very blessed and fortunate to have two parents my entire life who always told me — the lesson that my dad had learned himself in his brief professional football career — that professional football is the greatest temp job you""re ever going to have. You""ve always got to be preparing for that next step. You can pour your heart and soul and everything into your athletic career, but you""ve got to have the realization that even if you accomplish all of your wildest dreams, and have a 10 to 12 year professional sports career, you""re still gonna be walking away as a relatively young man. You get your whole life ahead of you. So I always had that expectation from the first day that I walked on campus at the University of Arkansas and the first day that I walked into the Patriots facility in Foxborough.  I was like ""hey, this could be over tomorrow."" You""re always one play away in the NFL. And I had some injuries there in my last couple of seasons. The injury bug finally bit me after a long career where I""ve been mostly healthy. But luckily I was prepared to take that next step. And I was ready to move on with my head held on. DW: The army then was that the next step for you? Was that something you had thought about throughout your career and your childhood? How did you come to that decision? BEQUETTE: I can""t pinpoint an exact day or a moment where I felt the call, I""ve always, been a student of history and have always loved to read biographies and historical narratives about some of the great soldiers and statesmen in our history. And I""ve always admired people who have military service as a part of their life""s story. In New England, we had a former Navy SEAL who was really a part of the team. He was a close personal childhood friend of one of our assistant coaches at the time, our defensive coordinator, Matt Patricia. And this former Navy SEAL came in to work with us in the offseason — hand to hand combat stuff, leverage type stuff, things that are useful on the football field. I always found myself pulling him aside and making him tell me war stories. I wanted to know what he did overseas, what the SEAL training was like, and what it was like to serve. I was surrounded by all these amazing champions in the Patriots locker room, but I felt myself more drawn to and in awe and admiration for this guy, this warrior. And I kind of resolved right there that whenever my football career was over, if I was healthy, that I was gonna serve in the military. I had some injuries at the end of my career, I took a year off and actually went to law school for a year. But I felt the call to serve and the moment that I was healthy enough to raise my right hand, that""s exactly what I did. DW: How many years did you serve in the military? BEQUETTE: I served in the Army for about three and a half years. I went through infantry training. I enlisted at Fort Benning, where I went through basic training and Officer Candidate School. I commissioned as a second lieutenant in January 2018. I branched into the army infantry, trying to become an Infantry officer, which includes the Infantry Basic Officer leadership course. I graduated US Army Ranger School in October of 2018. And then I served the entirety of my active service with the 101st Airborne Division, based in Fort Campbell, Kentucky — which is an amazing unit with an incredible legacy, the ""Band of Brothers."" That was my first choice, my only choice really of where I wanted to serve. I deployed to Iraq in 2019. I spent a little over five months in Iraq, and other than that, I was stateside training with 101st. DW: Was there any correlation between football and the army? We do hear a bit about football and how it kind of has a military theme to it. Are there any similarities whatsoever? BEQUETTE: Absolutely. So, here in SEC country — and you""ll find this out in Tennessee — the Tennessee football stadium is named after former General Neyland. As in Neyland Stadium in Knoxville, Tennessee. He was a former Army General who then became a football coach. So, there""s some natural crossover in my mind, between the structure of football and the structure of the military. Discipline, teamwork, sacrifice, hard work. And a football career was a great preparation, both mentally and physically, for a military career. It""s not totally analogous. In football you""re training at the utmost elite level for short bursts. In the army it""s a lot more grit and endurance type training. It""s not as glamorous. But I really couldn""t have asked for a better preparation for the military through my college football experience, and of course my experience in New England. I have to add — Coach Belichick is a tremendous patriot. His father, Steve Belichick, was a longtime coach at the Naval Academy. He liked to have current and former military members come and speak to the team. And he really ingrained a sense of patriotism that I always admired in the New England Patriots and, hence the name, it""s hard to not be patriotic playing for the Patriots. Jim Rogash/Getty Images DW: What are your ultimate goals here moving forward? You""ve accomplished quite a bit, but I""m assuming you have a lot that you""d like to accomplish as well. BEQUETTE: Yes. So right now I just moved home to Arkansas, where I""m born and raised. It""s great to be home. The first thing I did upon a turn to Arkansas was I started a small business Relief Fund. It""s called ""The Arkansas Fund."" I tailored it after the Barstool Fund, which I""m sure you""re aware, is a nationally focused small business Relief Fund. As we all know, there are so many small businesses across the country, particularly here in the state of Arkansas that have been really struggling due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. We""ve raised well over $100,000 and we""ve made over 33 grants in less than two months to small businesses across the state of Arkansas. And I""ve been able to channel my passion and my love for this state into this small business Relief Fund. It""s been a great project. We""ve been able to extend a helping hand to a lot of mom and pop small businesses that are hurting. DW: We had Aubrey Huff in studio last week, and he talked a bit about the amount of conservatives that are actually in Major League Baseball. Would you say it""s similar in the NFL locker room? Or is it less so than maybe Major League Baseball as far as the amount of conservatives that are in that locker room? BEQUETTE: I""m not sure if I could put a number on it, but I think it""s more than you might suspect. We used to joke, there may be a lot of guys who come into professional sports who might have a left leaning mindset or our background, but once they see the the tax withholding from that first paycheck or that first signing bonus, it""ll make you a conservative really quick. It""s really a shame to see what""s happened over the past five or six years since I left the game, in terms of just politics and especially leftist ideology. Coming into professional sports in particular, I think that tragically sports is one of the last institutions that unites us in this country. And it""s really a disgrace in my mind to see it torn apart by just the constant bombardment of leftist ideology from the media, and it""s permeating through those locker rooms. DW: Major League Baseball moved the All-Star Game out of Atlanta, due to the new Georgia election law. What were your initial thoughts on that, and the fact that they actually took it away from an area that could have benefited quite a bit from all the All-Star Game festivities and moving it to Denver – which is a less diverse city – I might add. BEQUETTE: Yeah, it was ludicrous. The losers here are the small business owners, who would have had a tremendous economic impact right there in Atlanta and the surrounding suburbs, from the All-Star Game. And it was just another attempt of virtue signaling by these pro sports leagues. The hypocrisy is extremely obvious. The 2016 election obviously happened, the MLB hosted the 2017 All Star game in Miami, and Florida has mandatory voter ID laws and fewer days of early voting than Georgia does. And you can""t even really engage in the hypocrisy because it""s just transparent virtue signaling. It was MLB""s attempt to show that they""re on the side of the Left. It really is a shame because as you said, the people who are really hurt by this are the small business owners –  a group that I""m working to help so it makes me angry.

Tim Scott (R-SC) slammed President Joe Biden on Wednesday night as he delivered the Republican Party""s rebuttal speech to the speech that Biden gave just moments prior that was panned by critics as divisive and extreme . ""We just heard President Biden""s first address to Congress. Our president seems like a good man,"" Scott began. ""His speech was full of good words.

Scott hammered Biden for dividing instead of uniting, and on numerous policy issues, including infrastructure, Biden""s ""Family Plan,"" and other extreme proposals. WATCH: TRANSCRIPT: Good evening. I""m Senator Tim Scott from the great state of South Carolina. We just heard President Biden""s first address to Congress. Our President seems like a good man. His speech was full of good words. But President Biden promised you a specific kind of leadership. He promised to unite a nation. To lower the temperature. To govern for all Americans, no matter how we voted. That was the pitch. You just heard it again. But our nation is starving for more than empty platitudes. We need policies and progress that bring us closer together. But three months in, the actions of the president and his party are pulling us further apart. I won""t waste your time with finger-pointing or partisan bickering. You can get that on T.V. any time you want. I want to have an honest conversation about common sense and common ground. About this feeling that our nation is sliding off its shared foundation and how we move forward together. Growing up, I never dreamed I""d be standing here tonight. When I was a kid, my parents divorced. My mother, my brother, and I moved in with my grandparents. Three of us, sharing one bedroom. I was disillusioned and angry, and I nearly failed out of school. But I was blessed. First, with a praying momma … I was also blessed by a Chick-Fil-A operator, John Moniz. And finally , with a string of opportunities that are only possible here in America. This past year, I""ve watched COVID attack every rung of the ladder that helped me up. So many families have lost parents and grandparents too early. So many small businesses have gone under. Becoming a Christian transformed my life — but for months, too many churches were shut down. Most of all, I am saddened that millions of kids have lost a year of learning when they could not afford to lose a single day. Locking vulnerable kids out of the classroom is locking adults out of their future. Our public schools should have reopened months ago. Other countries"" did. Private and religious schools did. Science has shown for months that schools are safe. But too often, powerful grown-ups set science aside. And kids like me were left behind. The clearest case for school choice in our lifetimes… Last year, under Republican leadership, we passed five bipartisan COVID packages. Congress supported our schools, our hospitals, saved our economy, and funded Operation Warp Speed, delivering vaccines in record time. All five bills got 90 … votes in the Senate. Common sense found common ground. In February, Republicans told President Biden we wanted to keep working together to finish this fight, but Democrats wanted to go it alone. They spent almost $2 trillion on a partisan bill that the White House bragged was the most liberal bill in American history! Only 1% went to vaccinations. No requirement to re-open schools promptly. COVID brought Congress together five times. This Administration pushed us apart. Another issue that should unite us is infrastructure. Republicans support everything you think of when you think of ""infrastructure."" Roads, bridges, ports, airports, waterways, high-speed broadband — we""re in for all of that. But again, Democrats want a partisan wish list. They won""t even build bridges to build bridges! Less than 6% of the president""s plan goes to roads and bridges. It""s a liberal wish-list of Big Government waste, plus the biggest job-killing tax hikes in a generation. Experts say, when all is said and done, it would lower wages of the average American worker and shrink our economy. Tonight we also heard about a so-called ""Family Plan."" Even more taxing, even more spending, to put Washington even more in the middle of your life — from the cradle to college. The beauty of the American Dream is that families get to define it for themselves. We should be expanding opportunities and options for all families — not throwing money at certain issues because Democrats think they know best. ""Infrastructure"" spending that shrinks our economy is not common sense. Weakening our southern borders and creating a crisis is not compassionate. The president is abandoning principles he held for decades. Now, he says your tax dollars should fund abortions. He""s laying groundwork to pack the Supreme Court! This is not common ground. Nowhere do we need common ground more desperately than in our discussions of race. I have experienced the pain of discrimination. I know what it feels like to be pulled over for no reason; to be followed around a store while I""m shopping. I remember, every morning, at the kitchen table, my grandfather would open the newspaper and read it, I thought. Later, I realized he had never learned to read it. He just wanted to set the right example. I""ve also experienced a different kind of intolerance. I get called ""Uncle Tom"" and the N-word — by ""progressives."" By liberals. Just last week, a national newspaper suggested my family""s poverty was actually privilege because a relative owned land generations before my time. Believe me, I know first hand our healing is not finished. In 2015, after the shooting of Walter Scott, I wrote a bill to fund body cameras. Last year, after the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, I built an even bigger police reform proposal. But my Democratic colleagues blocked it! I extended an olive branch. I offered them amendments. But Democrats used the filibuster to block the debate from even happening. My friends across the aisle seemed to want the issue more than they wanted a solution. But I""m still working. I""m hopeful that this will be different. When America comes together, we""ve made tremendous progress. But powerful forces want to pull us apart. A hundred years ago, kids in classrooms were taught the color of their skin was their most important characteristic — and if they looked a certain way, they were inferior. Today, kids are being taught that the color of their skin defines them again — and if they look a certain way, they""re an oppressor. From colleges to corporations to our culture, people are making money and gaining power by pretending we haven""t made any progress at all, by doubling down on the divisions we""ve worked so hard to heal. You know this stuff is wrong. Hear me clearly: America is not a racist country. It""s backwards to fight discrimination with different types of discrimination. And it""s wrong to try to use our painful past to dishonestly shut down debates in the present. I""m an African American who has voted in the South my entire life. I take voting rights personally. Republicans support making it easier to vote and harder to cheat. And so do the voters! Big majorities of Americans support early voting, and big majorities support Voter I.D. — including African Americans and Hispanics. Common sense makes common ground. But today, this conversation has collapsed. The state of Georgia passed a law that expands early voting; preserves no-excuse mail-in voting; and, despite what the president claimed, did not reduce Election Day hours. If you actually read this law, it""s mainstream! It will be easier to vote early in Georgia than in Democrat-run New York. But the Left doesn""t want you to know that. They want people virtue-signaling by yelling about a law they haven""t even read! Fact-checkers have called out the White House for misstatements. The president absurdly claims this is worse than Jim Crow. What is going on here? I""ll tell you. A Washington power grab. This misplaced outrage is supposed to justify Democrats"" new sweeping bill that would take over elections for all 50 states; it would send public funds to political campaigns you disagree with, and make the bipartisan Federal Elections Commission partisan! This is not about civil rights, or our racial past. It""s about rigging elections in the future. And, no — the same filibuster that President Obama and President Biden praised when they were senators, the same filibuster that the Democrats used to kill my police reform bill last year, has not suddenly become a racist relic just because the shoe is now on the other foot! Race is not a political weapon to settle every issue the way one side wants. It""s far too important. This should be a joyful springtime for our nation. This administration inherited a tide that had already turned. The coronavirus is on the run! Thanks to Operation Warp Speed and the Trump Administration, our country is flooded with safe and effective vaccines. Thanks to our bipartisan work last year, job openings are rebounding. So why do we feel so divided, anxious? A nation with so much cause for hope should not feel so heavy-laden. A president who promised to bring us together should not push agendas that tear us apart. The American family deserves better. And we know what better looks like! Just before COVID, we had the most inclusive economy in my lifetime. The lowest unemployment rates ever recorded for African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. And a 70-year low, nearly, for women. Wages were growing faster at the bottom than at the top… That happened because Republicans focused on expanding opportunity for all Americans… We passed Opportunity Zones, criminal justice reform, and permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities for the first time ever. We fought the drug epidemic, rebuilt our military, and cut taxes for working families and single moms like the one that raised me. Our best future won""t come from Washington schemes or socialist dreams. It will come from you — the American people. Black, Hispanic, white, and Asian. Republican and Democrat. Brave police officers and black neighborhoods. We are not adversaries. We are family! We are all in this together. And we get to live in the greatest country on Earth. The country where my grandfather, in his 94 years, saw his family go from cotton to Congress in one lifetime. So I am more than hopeful — I am confident — that our finest hour is yet to come. Original sin is never the end of the story. Not in our souls, and not for our nation. The real story is always redemption. I am standing here because my mom has prayed me through some really tough times. I believe our nation has succeeded the same way: Because generations of Americans, in their own ways, have asked for grace, and God has supplied it. So I will close with a word from a worship song that really helped me through this past year. The music is new, but the words draw from Scripture. May the Lord bless you and keep you, Make His face shine upon you And be gracious to you… May His presence go before you, And behind you, and beside you… In your weeping and your rejoicing, He is with you… May His favor be upon our nation for a thousand generations And your family… and your children… And their children.

daily_wire|"After Major League Baseball (MLB) moved its All-Star Game out of Georgia, USA Today ""stealth-edited"" a March 31 op-ed by activist and failed Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams that said she ""can""t argue"" with boycotts. The secretive edits, which were detected and disseminated on Twitter by Republican operative Matt Whitlock on April 23, softened her language and blamed Republicans for the MLB boycott. They were not initially accompanied by an editor""s note. One appears to have been added sometime after April 21. ""The impassioned response to the racist, classist bill that is now the law of Georgia is to boycott in order to achieve change,"" Abrams wrote at first . ""Events hosted by major league baseball, world class soccer, college sports and dozens of Hollywood films hang in the balance. At the same time, activists urge Georgians to swear off of hometown products to express our outrage. Until we hear clear, unequivocal statements that show Georgia-based companies get what""s at stake, I can""t argue with an individual""s choice to opt for their competition."" ""However, one lesson of boycotts is that the pain of deprivation must be shared to be sustainable,"" continued Abrams. ""Otherwise, those least resilient bear the brunt of these actions; and in the aftermath, they struggle to access the victory. And boycotts are complicated affairs that require a long-term commitment to action. I have no doubt that voters of color, particularly Black voters, are willing to endure the hardships of boycotts. But I don""t think that""s necessary — yet … I ask you to bring your business to Georgia and, if you""re already here, stay and fight. Stay and vote."" As Whitlock noted based on archival photos of the webpage, sometime after the MLB moved the All-Star Game, language that suggested Abrams supported boycotts was quietly revised, and paragraphs that strongly urged against boycotts and blamed Republicans for the loss of the All-Star Game were added. Not over the fact that Stacey Abrams published an op-Ed about the Georgia law saying ""boycotts work,"" and she wouldn""t blame anyone for boycotting.. Then AFTER the MLB move, STEALTH EDITED the op-Ed with stronger language opposing boycotts, and media have used it to defend her. https://t.co/A284wksh2c — Matt Whitlock (@mattdizwhitlock) April 24, 2021 And yet, as this 4/21 archive shows, the editor's note was not present. It appears the op-ed was revised on April 6th, but an editor's note about the change was only added within the past 2 days: https://t.co/JLR1YWTeDd  pic.twitter.com/bqpxOmIBjK — Jeryl Bier (@JerylBier) April 23, 2021 She removed ""I can't argue with an individuals choice to opt out"" (referring to boycotts — see previous tweet) And followed with major changes to her paragraph about the pain boycotts cause, adding in the updated version ""Boycotts invariably also cost jobs."" Interesting. pic.twitter.com/5jezS3zq7t — Matt Whitlock (@mattdizwhitlock) April 23, 2021 ""The impassioned (and understandable) response to the racist, classist bill that is now the law of Georgia is to boycott in order to achieve change. Events that can bring millions of dollars to struggling families hang in the balance,"" the new version said. ""Major League Baseball pulled both its All-Star Game and its draft from Georgia, which could cost our state nearly $100 million in lost revenue."" Going on to blame Republicans, Abrams continued, ""Rather than accept responsibility for their craven actions, Republican leaders blame me and others who have championed voting rights (and actually read the bill). Their faux outrage is designed to hide the fact that they prioritized making it harder for people of color to vote over the economic well-being of all Georgians. To add to the injury, the failed former president is now calling for cancellation of baseball as the national pastime."" ""Boycotts invariably also cost jobs,"" new portions of the op-ed went on. ""To be sustainable, the pain of deprivation must be shared rather than borne by those who are least resilient … I have no doubt that voters of color, particularly Black voters, are willing to endure the hardships of boycotts. But such monetary loss is unlikely to affect the stubborn, frightened Republicans who see voter suppression as their only way to win. Money isn""t quite as seductive as political power to these putative leaders."" Slipping in a new condemnation of boycotts, Abrams wrote, ""Instead of a boycott, I strongly urge other events and productions to do business in Georgia and speak out against our law and similar proposals in other states."" Weeks after the edits, sometime around the time of Whitlock""s tweet, USA Today appended an editor""s note to the top of the piece that said : ""This column was originally published before the MLB moved the All-Star game out of Atlanta. It was updated after that decision."" A spokesman for USA Today""s parent company, Gannett, told Fox News in a statement: ""We regret the oversight in updating the Stacey Abrams column. As soon as we recognized there was no editor""s note, we added it to the page to reflect her changes. We have reviewed our procedures to ensure this does not occur again."" As Whitlock observed, fact-checkers and Twitter used Abrams"" newly-edited article to defend her against accusations that she was not to blame for the All-Star Game leaving Georgia, despite sources who spoke to Fox News claiming that Major League Baseball (MLB) commissioner Robert Manfred decided to move it after extensive discussions with voting rights groups associated with Abrams, NBA player LeBron James, and Al Sharpton. ""That""s some Orwellian stuff,"" said Whitlock. This article was updated to include a statement given to Fox News.

daily_wire|"After last month""s decision by Major League Baseball to move their annual All-Star game out of Atlanta, GA in reaction to the state""s new election laws, the conversation surrounding sports leagues and their involvement in politics has reached a fever pitch. Aubrey Huff, a 13-year MLB veteran and two-time World Series champion, told The Daily Wire that ""players were blindsided"" and that ""This had nothing to do with race. This had nothing to do with politics. This had everything to do with money."" MLB""s decision to bow down to the woke mob was a reminder to conservatives that not only do their beliefs fall on deaf ears, they are dismissed entirely. Sports organizations making decisions based on which way the political winds are blowing at the time, have driven conservatives away from the games. Jake Bequette, former New England Patriots tight end and United States Army veteran, went a step further than Huff and voiced his displeasure on the decision in an exclusive interview with The Daily Wire. ""Yeah, it was ludicrous,"" Bequette told The Daily Wire. ""The only losers here are the small business owners, who would have had a tremendous economic impact right there in Atlanta and the surrounding suburbs, from the All-Star Game. And it was just another attempt of virtue signaling by these pro sports leagues. You know, the hypocrisy, as I""m sure you""re aware, is extremely, extremely obvious."" ""The 2016 election obviously happened, the MLB hosted the 2017 All Star game in Miami, and Florida has mandatory voter ID laws and fewer days of early voting than Georgia does. And you can""t even really engage in the hypocrisy because it""s just transparent virtue signaling. It was MLB""s attempt to show that they""re on the side of the Left. It really is a shame because the people who are really hurt by this are the small business owners. A group that I""m working to help so it makes me angry."" Yes. The Daily Wire is covering sports – without the woke. Want more? Become a member. The decision by Major League Baseball had many questioning whether the players had any say in the matter. And while a league like the NBA undoubtedly leans Left, the political views of members of the NFL and MLB are less obvious. ""I""m not sure if I could put a number on it but I think it""s more than you might suspect,"" Bequette said when asked about the number of conservatives in the NFL.  ""We used to joke, there may be a lot of guys who come into professional sports that have a left leaning mindset or background, but once they see the tax withholding from that first paycheck, or that first signing bonus, it""ll make you a conservative really quick."" Sports used to be the one aspect of life where Americans could come together and simply enjoy the atmosphere and athletic feats that come with viewing a game. There was a solace that came with sports and the total absence of daily political disagreements. Those days are long gone – a fact that Bequette finds disgraceful. ""It""s really a shame to see what""s happened over the past five or six years since I left the game, in terms of just politics, and especially leftist ideology,"" Bequette said. ""You know, coming into professional sports in particular, I think that, tragically, sports is one of the last institutions that unites us in this country. And it""s really a disgrace in my mind to see it torn apart by just the constant bombardment of leftist ideology from the media, and it""s permeating through those locker rooms.""

daily_wire|"TIME Magazine misleadingly fact-checked Georgia""s Republican secretary of state on Monday when he noted that Stacey Abrams did not concede Georgia""s 2018 gubernatorial race. ""My viewpoint is that we took a hit to the confidence in the election process going back to 2018 with Stacey Abrams. She did not concede defeat,"" Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in an interview with TIME published on Monday. The suggestion that Abrams could have contributed to Georgia""s election confidence problem appeared to ruffle the feathers of the left-leaning news magazine, which added an asterisk and a lengthy note attempting to discredit Raffensperger""s statement. ""Stacey Abrams said in 2018 that she acknowledged governor Brian Kemp would be certified as the election""s winner,"" read the original fact-check note. (In the same speech when Abrams made those remarks, Abrams also stated : ""Let""s be clear, this is not a speech of concession."") Raffensperger""s communications director told The Daily Wire that after he complained, TIME edited the fact-check note to acknowledge that Abrams has reminded the public numerous times since 2018 that she has not conceded the race. ""Stacey Abrams said in 2018 that she acknowledged governor Brian Kemp would be certified as the election""s winner but has said repeatedly that she did not concede,"" read the edited sentence. The rest of TIME""s fact-check note remained the same, citing Abrams""s remarks at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing earlier this month during which she agreed that her Republican opponent won but said it was under unfair rules. ""As I have always said, I acknowledged at the very beginning that Brian Kemp won under the rules that were in place,"" Abrams told the committee. ""What I object to are rules that permitted thousands of Georgia voters to be denied their participation in this election and had their votes cast out."" Raffensperger has also accused Abrams of ""collecting hundreds of millions of dollars from donors convinced the election had been stolen from her."" Georgia has suffered a crisis of election confidence over the last several years, the state""s election system weathering attacks from both Democrats and Republicans for a slew of reasons. Republican Governor Brian Kemp, Abrams""s former opponent, was Georgia""s secretary of state at the time of the 2018 election. In that role, he oversaw a massive voter roll purge of hundreds of thousands of Georgians who had moved away, died, or skipped too many elections. Kemp argued the move was to protect the election from fraud. Last year in the wake of the presidential election, Raffensperger said he came under pressure from fellow Republicans as they scrambled to find a way to reverse former President Donald Trump""s narrow defeat in the former Republican stronghold. The secretary of state said he even received death threats as Georgia conducted a recount in November. Last month, Kemp signed a new voting law that prompted an immediate outcry from critics who declared the law ""Jim Crow 2.0."" Democrats condemned the law as severely restricting voting access, especially for voters of color, while President Joe Biden called the law an ""atrocity"" and said that his Justice Department is reviewing it. Raffensperger has defended the law, arguing that it expands rather than restricts voting access. For example, the bill does away with ballot signature verification, which Raffensperger said is ""very subjective,"" instead requiring voters to present some form of government photo ID.

blaze|"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) fired back at MSNBC host Joy Reid after she said Tuesday that Cruz was betraying his race by opposing the "" For the People Act ,"" a sweeping piece of legislation supported by Democrats that would radically transform state and federal elections laws. Earlier this week, Cruz flipped the script on Democrats by claiming the ""For the People Act"" would weaken election security and implement ""Jim Crow 2.0"" to ""steal voting rights from the American people."" His use of the phrase ""Jim Crow 2.0"" was cheeky — it's the same phrase Democrats have used to describe new Republican-supported election integrity laws in Georgia, Florida, Texas, and elsewhere. On a panel discussing the legislation with Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and NAACP attorney Janai Nelson, Reid and the others agreed that Cruz's opposition to the bill and his use of the term ""Jim Crow"" was ""beyond offensive."" She called Cruz ""Stephen from Django Unchained,"" referring to the character Stephen from the 2012 Quentin Tarantino film who is a house slave in antebellum Mississippi that supports his cruel master's oppression of the other black slaves. ""Ted Cruz says a lot of stupid things. He does a lot of stupid things. But I personally, as a person of color, as a black person, am beyond offended that he would dare use the word 'Jim Crow' when his party is literally a 'Jim Crow' party at this point trying to suppress the votes of people, including in his home state,"" Reid said. Continuing, Reid said Cruz ""could give a damn about Jim Crow"" and claimed without evidence that he ""never raised once concern ever in his entire life ... about Jim Crow or racism or discrimination."" She accused Republicans of wanting to prevent non-white people from voting and claimed that without the ""For the People Act"" overturning election security measures, the United States ""may never get another free and fair election again."" ""I think what you see here on your screen is what Republicans fear in the voting booth,"" Reid said, gesturing to guests Padilla and Nelson and referring to their skin color. ""And they're going to do everything they can to make sure it doesn't happen, including Stephen from Django Unchained, AKA Ted Cruz, who is working to stop fellow people of color from voting, which is amazing."" Cruz responded to Reid's racist remarks Wednesday, accusing Reid of using a racial slur. ""I appreciate MSNBC lecturing me on how people of ""my race"" are supposed to vote. This arrogant condescension is a big reason Hispanic voters are moving right in large numbers,"" Cruz tweeted . ""Also, why is MSNBC ok with their hosts using overt racial slurs ('Stephen from Django')?"""

He warned corporate executives that it will be Republicans who protect their businesses, not Democrats. In the past few months, there have been several major corporations who have bent the knee to the leftist mob in an effort to appear progressive and woke. Major League Baseball moved its All-Star game from Georgia to Colorado in a stand against the Peach State's new voter ID laws despite Colorado having similar, arguably more stringent, voting restrictions . Coca-Cola's CEO spoke out against Georgia's new voting laws , as did the CEO of Delta Airlines . Notable GOP members have rallied against corporations bending the knee to the outrage mob, including former President Donald Trump, who issued a warning about ""woke cancel culture "" and called for ""Republicans and conservatives to fight back.""

Graham is the latest Republican to hammer corporations for attempting to appease the cancel culture crowd. ""They are trying to intimidate corporate America to abandon the Republican Party,"" Graham said during a recent appearance on "" Hannity ."" ""Here's my message to corporate America, corporate Georgia: have you lost your mind?"" ""Don't you realize that the only thing between you, and your companies, and your shareholders and the Democratic agenda of high taxes, incredible regulations, and unbelievable spending is the Republican Party? Don't you realize that the two Democrats in Georgia, in the United States Senate are fully on board for the most radical agenda in the history of the country when it comes to tax spending and regulation? So they're intimidated,"" the Republican from South Carolina told Fox News host Sean Hannity. ""Here's what happened two days ago when I was in Georgia speaking to the annual Republican party fundraising dinner for the Republican Party of Georgia, 18 corporations who money gave money last year, decided not to give a dime this year,"" Graham said. ""Only one corporation in Georgia helped the Republican Party, Georgia Power. They lost $150,000 because corporations in Georgia have been intimidated by this idea of 'Jim Crow 2.0.'

Liz Cheney (Wyo.) is urging her party to ""steer away"" from the ""Trump cult of personality"" as she faces being ousted from her leadership position — and possibly even her House seat — over her criticisms of former President Donald Trump. In a piece published in The Washington Post on Tuesday afternoon, Cheney asserted that ""the GOP is at a turning point"" and ""history is watching us."" Cheney wrote in her opening: She argued toward the end: The op-ed comes amid reports that Republicans are seeking to boot Cheney from her post as the third-ranking Republican in the caucus, over her insistence that Trump — a popular figure in the GOP — is dishonest and bad for the party. The front-runner for replacing Cheney is purportedly Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), a staunch Trump loyalist. Trump, who has repeatedly fired back at Cheney, issued a statement the same day as her op-ed, writing: But not all conservatives are on board with Stefanik, either. After several Republicans voiced their support for Stefanik being elevated to replace Cheney, the Club for Growth tweeted, ""Elise Stefanik is NOT a good spokesperson for the House Republican Conference. She is a liberal with a 35% Club for Growth Foundation lifetime rating, 4th worst in the House GOP. House Republicans should find a conservative to lead messaging and win back the House Majority.""  Gabriel Sterling — a top election official in Georgia who has also taken heat from fellow Republicans over the handling of the general election in the state — argued, ""Liz Cheney is more conservative on issues than Elise Stefanik. Cheney voted with Pres. Trump's agenda more than Stefanik. Cheney doesn't support Trump's Big Lie that the election was stolen, Stefanik does. This isn't about philosophy...it's about personality and ego alone."""
blaze|"MSNBC host Tiffany Cross recommenced the racist diatribe against Republican Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.) over the weekend, calling the black senator ""token,"" ""tap dancer,"" and ""clown"" among a litany of other racially charged insults in response to his rebuttal of President Joe Biden's first address to a joint session of Congress. Scott had once again become the subject of racist attacks from the left last week after declaring in the GOP response to Biden's speech that ""America is not a racist country."" As if trying to prove Scott wrong by openly displaying their racism, liberal critics on social media piled on with insults for the senator, at one point causing ""Uncle Tim"" to trend on Twitter . That apparently wasn't enough for Cross, however, who took the opportunity on Saturday to launch some attacks of her own on network television. ""Name a political, social, or economic institution in America where widespread disparities and discrimination does not exist,"" the Root's Michael Harriot said, to which Cross responded, ""The hollow institution that resides inside Republican Sen. Tim Scott's head. No racism there, and apparently no sense either."" Tim Scott is a ""stone fool,"" Cross charged before adding that he ""does not represent any constituency other than the small number of sleepy slow-witted sufferers of Stockholm Syndrome who get elevated to prominence for repeating a false narrative about this country that makes conservative white people feel comfortable,"" as images of the other prominent black conservatives flashed on the screen.   Tiffany Cross Rebuts Senator Tim Scott's Comments On Race in America | MSNBC   www.youtube.com   During the segment, Cross slandered Scott as a ""token,"" a ""clown,"" and a ""tap dancer"" for Republican Minority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (Ky.). Yet she failed to refute a single policy proposal from Scott's speech, saying only that she wouldn't ""argue with people Harriet Tubman would have left behind."" ""There are two sides to every token. So thirsty for white approval, this dude actually stood on the national stage to defend the voter suppression law in Georgia,"" she said, repeating lies about Georgia's voting law — which actually expands early voting hours. ""Please, senator, say more about how un-racist the country is, while you trot out that tired line about going from 'cotton to Congress' to clown,"" she continued, echoing an egregious probe of Scott's family heritage recently put on by Washington Post fact-checkers. ""Perhaps, this was merely Sen. Scott's audition to be Sam Jackson's understudy in the film 'DJango,'"" Cross added before calling herself a ""daily survivor of institutional racism."" In the film Cross referred to, ""DJango Unchained,"" Jackson played a head slave in 1800s America who looks down upon other slaves and is known for loyalty to his master. Unsurprisingly, Cross's racist tirade against Scott earned applause from fellow progressive MSNBC host Joy Reid."
blaze|"North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson has made history and waves recently. Robinson — a Republican — became the state's first black lieutenant governor when he was sworn in Jan. 9 after winning his election last November. In his elected role, he had the duty of presiding over Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's State of the State address last week — making him the first black elected official to do so in the history of the Tar Heel State. With such a powerful moment going on around him, one would think the governor would consider it worth mentioning during his annual address, the Rev. March Creech wrote in an op-ed for the Christian Post on Monday. But anyone unfamiliar with Robinson's accomplishments would have learned nothing about them if Cooper's address was their source of information, state Senate Leader Phil Berger noted on Twitter. ""An indication of how far North Carolina has come is @markrobinsonNC, our first black Lt. Governor presiding over tonight's State of the State,"" Berger said. ""An indication of how far the NC Democratic Party has to go is the Democratic Gov's failure to recognize him during the speech."" Creech pointed out that the offense was particularly hypocritical considering Cooper's past rhetoric and actions regarding Black Lives Matter and other race-related issues, not to mention the Democratic Party's ongoing claim to be all about supporting and celebrating black Americans' accomplishments: Naturally, the mainstream media couldn't be bothered to bring up Cooper's blatant snub. Creech is pretty sure he knows why: ""Robinson doesn't fit the liberal narrative."" The lieutenant governor is an outspoken social conservative Republican who is not shy about sharing his Christian faith, which means he is ""not the kind of minority that helps the left's cause."" Being the wrong kind of black man ""won't even get you honorable mention in the halls of power with Leftists like Gov. Cooper, even if you are the first black Lt. Governor in the State's history,"" Creech wrote. ""Race, race, race. It's seemingly almost all we hear about from the Left these days. But when Democratic politicians, like Cooper, overlook, ignore, and diminish great men such as Mark Robinson, it seems to confirm the suspicion that race is being wielded as a political weapon."" On April 22, Robinson was invited to testify at a hearing in the House of Representatives on the Voting Rights Act. Democrats conducted the hearing to criticize the new Georgia voting law that the left has been caught lying about and has purposefully mischaracterized as a return to the Jim Crow era. During his opening remarks, Robinson called it ""insane"" and ""insulting"" to compare the voter ID laws passed in Georgia and other states to Jim Crow laws that were used to tyrannize black Americans and keep them from voting. After elaborating on how and why it is ""preposterous"" to compare the Georgia law to Jim Crow laws, he launched into a history lesson, explaining that it was the Republican Party that backed voting rights for black people while the Democratic Party supported voter suppression and Jim Crow. ""That history is clear who stood on which side at every turn in history,"" Robinson said. ""It is clear; it's not even in dispute."""
blaze|"Following passage of Georgia's new voting law, multiple CEOs of major American companies tripped over themselves to condemn the law when America's far-left woke brigade came showed up with torches and pitchforks and threatened to blacklist them if they didn't do more to condemn the law. CBS News even got in on the act with a ""news"" story headlined ""3 ways companies can help fight Georgia's restrictive new voting law."" And their efforts worked. For example: More than 60 other executives from other businesses have come out to publicly blast the law, the Hill reported . Those companies include American Express, HP, Nordstrom, MasterCard, Starbucks, Verizon, Uber, Pfizer, Google, GE, Merck, Bank of America, and Boeing. Nearly 200 companies have signed a statement denouncing other Georgia-style voting laws ""threatening to make voting more difficult"" that are being debated across the country, the Washington Post said . Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said this week that it's time the GOP stand up to woke CEOs. Cruz took to the op-ed pages of the Wall Street Journal on Thursday to inform those CEOs that Republicans are done with them and wished them luck when taxes and regulations start to bury them and they have to knock on Democrats' doors for help. The senator began his piece, "" Your Woke Money Is No Good Here ,"" blasting the businessmen for clearly not reading the Georgia law and instead relying on crib notes from left-wing activists: Cruz then said it's time for Republicans to stop ignoring these outrages from CEOs simply because they are ""job creators"" and to instead strike back. It's past time to put these ""fair-weather friends"" in their place: The lawmaker, who admitted that he had received $2.6 million in corporate PAC contributions, said that from now on he's taking no more of their money. Liberal CEOs and companies have spent years, along with their left-wing pals, attacking GOP values without paying a price. That time is over, Cruz declared. ""As America's greatest basketball player observed years ago, Republicans buy sneakers, too. We cast votes, too,"" Cruz warned. ""And we pay attention when CEOs come after our own just so they can look good for a few editorial pages and radical activists."" ""To them I say: When the time comes that you need help with a tax break or a regulatory change, I hope the Democrats take your calls, because we may not. Starting today, we won't take your money either,"" he concluded."
blaze|"After Republican Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.) delivered an impassioned rebuttal to President Joe Biden's address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, declaring that despite the president's claims, ""America is not a racist country,"" liberals on Twitter immediately tried to discredit his claims by launching racial epithets at him. In the speech , Scott acknowledged that while America's racial ""healing"" remains an unfinished task, no amount of divisive rhetoric from Democratic politicians and progressive media figures could diminish the progress the country has made toward racial equality. Such progress is powerfully embodied in his own family's history, Scott suggested, pointing out that his family has gone from ""cotton to Congress"" in the span of one lifetime — a fact which, egregiously, was called into question by liberal Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler last week.

He recalled that last year, after the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, he built a police reform bill to address concerns over unchecked instances of police brutality in America. But Democrats blocked the bill from ever being debated in Congress by using a political tactic they now insist is racist — the filibuster. ""My friends across the aisle seemed to want the issue more than they wanted a solution,"" he charged. He later referred to Georgia's new voting law, which actually expands early voting opportunity in the state, but which Democrats — including the president — have falsely branded as the new ""Jim Crow."" Republicans have an interest in making it ""easier to vote and harder to cheat,"" Scott said, but Democrats, on the other hand, are only interested in ""virtue-signaling."" ""Race is not a political weapon to settle every issue the way one side wants. It's far too important,"" Scott said to close out discussion on the topic. Stopping at nothing to discredit his assessment that ""America is not a racist country,"" liberals immediately launched a racist offensive against Scott on social media, using racial epithets.

blaze|"USA Today admitted that it allowed an edit to an op-ed written by Stacey Abrams be made without citing the change, and that op-ed was erroneously used by PolitiFact to defend her from her critics. The piece was published by USA Today on March 31, just days before Major League Baseball pulled its game from Atlanta over exaggerated accusations against the state's new election reforms. In it, Abrams advocated for boycotts to pressure politicians to cave to demands from Democrats. But in a later version of the op-ed, it was edited in order to water down her support for the use of boycotts against Georgia. That revised op-ed was then cited by PolitiFact to defend Abrams from critics blaming her for the economic damage to the state from the boycott. Republican strategist Matt Whitlock documented the dishonest shenanigans on Twitter. PolitiFact later added an editor's note and added a minor clarification that the op-ed had been changed from its previous version. ""We updated this article after initial publication to clarify the publication dates of Abrams' USA Today op-ed,"" the outlet added. The original version of the op-ed penned by Abrams was far more supportive of the boycott: While the revised version makes it sound as if Abrams preferred other protests against the law: PolitiFact faced similar criticism over its biased reporting against Sen.

blaze|"The lieutenant governor of North Carolina, the first black man to hold that office, excoriated arguments from Democrats that compare voter integrity measures such as the new law passed in Georgia to racist voter suppression laws of the Jim Crow south. On Thursday, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson (R) testified at a hearing in the House of Representatives titled, ""Oversight of the Voting Rights Act: The Evolving Landscape of Voting Discrimination."" In his opening remarks, he said it was ""insane"" and ""insulting"" for anyone to compare the voter ID laws passed in Georgia and other states to Jim Crow laws that were used to tyrannize black Americans and keep them from voting. ""My people were put in the belly of ships, bound by chains, and endured the middle passage. My people were whipped, beaten, and sold as property. In Reconstruction and throughout Jim Crow, black people were intimidated, harassed, and even killed to keep them from having a voice in government,"" Robinson told House lawmakers. ""Symbols like chains, nooses, and burnt crosses are not just symbols of death, they are symbols of forced and coerced silence. ""The sacrifices of our ancestors so I could have the opportunity to become the first black lieutenant governor of my state, to see a black man sit in the White House, and for millions of us to be leaders in business, athletics, and culture is incredible,"" he continued. Turning to the Georgia law, which Democrats have accused of implementing ""Jim Crow in 2021"" by suppressing the minority vote, Robinson demanded to know how black voices were being silenced or kept out of the political process. ""How? By fear of a noose or chains? To be fired from work? To be ostracized by their communities? No. A free ID to vote. Let me say that again, a free ID to vote,"" he said. He continued: Later in the hearing, Robinson made it clear that historically it was the Republican Party that supported voting rights for black Americans and the Democratic Party that supported voter suppression and Jim Crow. ""That history is clear who stood on which side at every turn in history. It is clear, it's not even in dispute,"" Robinson said. ""What we want is integrity, we don't want power. We want integrity."" He also defended Republican-supported voter ID laws as ""simple American responsibility"" and reminded the Congress that Jim Crow laws ""wasn't just a poll tax."" ""You stepped outside the line during Jim Crow, you'd find yourself swinging from a tree,"" he said. Robinson called voter ID ""common sense legislation for the common good."" ""To say that somehow poor people, black people can't be involved in that responsibility, again, is insulting,"" he said."
blaze|"Failed gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams on Tuesday repeated her false claims that the 2018 race for governor in Georgia was ""stolen"" while testifying at a Senate hearing on voting rights. Abrams was enlisted by Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats as the star witness for their hearing , ""Jim Crow 2021: The Latest Assault on the Right to Vote,"" which examined the new election reforms adopted by Georgia last month. Democrats, including Abrams and President Joe BIden, have accused Georgia Republicans of reintroducing ""Jim Crow,"" claiming the Georgia law makes it harder for blacks and other minorities to vote — a charge Republicans vehemently deny . At the hearing, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) grilled Abrams on whether she still believes the 2018 race for governor was stolen from her, noting that she never conceded the race to Gov. Brian Kemp (R). ""It's been over two years, and you still refuse to concede that you lost the race for governor in Georgia in 2018,"" Cruz said. ""Yes or no, today, do you still maintain that the 2018 Georgia election was stolen?"" ""As I have always said, I acknowledged at the very beginning that Brian Kemp won under the rules in place. What I object to are rules that permitted thousands of Georgia voters to be denied their participation in this election, to have their votes cast out. And so I will continue to disagree with the system until it is fixed,"" Abrams replied. But Cruz pressed her to answer a ""yes or no"" question on whether she still maintains the 2018 election was stolen. ""My full language was that it was stolen from the voters of Georgia. We do not know what they would have done because not every eligible Georgian was able to participate fully in the election,"" she argued. Following up, Cruz reminded Abrams that she previously told the New York Times that her loss ""was fully attributable to voter suppression."" ""Ms. Abrams, do you know in Georgia whether the percentage of African American Georgians who are registered to vote and who turned out to vote is it higher or lower than the national average?"" he asked. Abrams admitted ""it is higher than the national average because Georgia's one of the largest states with an African American population."" Cruz noted that the percentage of black people registered to vote in Georgia in 2018 was 64.7%, higher than the national average of 60.2%. He said that the percentage of Georgians who voted in 2018 was 56.3%, higher than the national average of 48%. ""Let me ask you this, Ms. Abrams,"" Cruz continued. ""In 2018, do you know which demographic group in Georgia had the highest registration percentage and the highest turnout percentage?"" ""I have a guess but I will defer to you for the answer,"" Abrams responded. ""The answer is African Americans had the highest registration and the highest turnout despite your claiming that the election was stolen and that there was somehow voter suppression,"" Cruz informed her."

""Reforms to make voter ID requirements and early voting access more consistent statewide, modernize the state""s voting rolls, and ensure robust oversight of voting and elections will protect Georgia""s votes and make the state a model for the rest of the country,"" Anderson added. With the current session of the Georgia General Assembly scheduled to end next week on March 31, SB 202 moved with lightning speed from a bill scheduled for a floor vote on the Georgia House of Representatives to a statute in a matter of hours on Thursday. Early on Thursday afternoon, the bill passed the Georgia House of Representatives in a partisan 100 to 75 vote . Quickly, the bill was taken up by the Georgia State Senate where it passed in a partisan 34 to 20 vote . The bill then moved quickly to the office of Gov. Brian Kemp, who quickly signed it into law late Thursday afternoon. Georgia Democrats reacted to the bill""s passage and Kemp""s signing it into law unfavorably, as Breitbart News reported : Martin Luther King III, son of the slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., called the law ""racist"" in an appearance on CNN Thursday night. Those early reactions indicate the national battle between Republicans, who characterize bills currently under consideration in several other state legislatures as election integrity reforms, and Democrats and most mainstream media outlets, who characterize them as ""voter suppression,"" is about to heat up. The national attention on election law legislation is also heating up as H.R. 1, which was passed through the U.S. House of Representatives this month, has moved to the U.S. Senate for consideration. Democrats have named that bill ""The For the People Act,"" while Republicans and conservatives call it ""The Corrupt Politicians Act."" One key provision of the new law, whose overarching purpose is to ""comprehensively revise elections and voting,"" is a direct rebuke of current Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, whose controversial decisions and open political combat with former President Donald Trump defined the 2020 presidential election in the state. For decades, the five-member Georgia State Election Board has been responsible for the administration of elections in the state, and the secretary of state has been the most influential member of that five-member board. With the signing of S.B. 202, ""The Election Integrity Act of 2021"" into law on Thursday, the secretary of state has now been removed as a voting member of the state election board permanently. Key provisions of the bill reduce the role of the secretary of state in the administration of elections. The bill: Another key provision of the new law limits the number and location of drop boxes. An estimated 600,000 vote-by-mail absentee ballots (out of five million votes cast) were deposited in more than 300 drop boxes established throughout the state in the 2020 presidential election. According to the Emergency Election Rule promulgated by the Georgia State Election Board in July 2020, documentation of the transfer of ballots from these drop boxes to the local county registrars or their designees was supposed to be memorialized in ballot transfer control forms. When asked by Breitbart News in December about the number, location, and status of these ballot transfer forms, a spokesperson for the secretary of state said they had no idea and that it was the responsibility of the state""s 159 counties to keep track of these ballot transfer forms: The new law states, ""the board of registrars may establish additional sites as additional registrar""s offices or places of registration for the purpose of receiving absentee ballots … and for the purpose of voting absentee ballots advance … provided that any such site is a building that is a branch of the county courthouse, a courthouse annex, a government service center providing general government services, another government building generally accessible to the public, or a location building that is used as an election day polling place, notwithstanding that such location building is not a government building."" In other words, the placement of drop boxes outside of official government building locations is prohibited. In addition, the number of drop boxes is limited: Some supporters of the new law say that it prohibits private funding for the administration of elections, the controversial practice that many Republicans believe resulted in turning local election offices around the country — and Georgia in particular — into Get-Out-the-Vote arms of the Democratic Party. As Breitbart News reported : While the new Georgia law signed by Gov. Kemp on Thursday prohibits local election superintendents from accepting private funding for the administration of elections, one election integrity expert says it contains a loophole. Section 9 (b) of the 95-page law states, ""No superintendent shall take or accept any funding, grants, or gifts from any source other than from the governing authority of the county or municipality, the State of Georgia, or the federal government."" Phill Kline, executive director of the Amistad Project of the Thomas More Society, told Breitbart News that the provision""s failure to explicitly prohibit county governments, municipalities, or the State of Georgia from accepting private funding is a loophole that should be closed. Kline stated that a bill passed by the Arizona House of Representatives this month that specifically prohibits any state government, county government, or municipal entity from accepting or expending private funds for the administration of elections is ""far superior"" to the new Georgia statute. Kline""s critique may have influenced the final version of the bill that became law on Thursday, which included a new provision. Section 9 (c) of the new law states, ""The State Election Board shall study and report to the General Assembly a proposed method for accepting donations intended to facilitate the administration of elections and a method for an equitable distribution of such donations state wide by October 1, 2021."" Heritage Action""s Anderson praised the work of grassroots activists in securing the passage of the election reform legislation. ""Grassroots activists across Georgia worked with lawmakers every step of the way to restore trust and transparency in the electoral process — every voter has the right to trust that their vote counts. Heritage Action is proud to have partnered with over 20,000 activists in the state to help secure these reforms, and we look forward to SB 202 being signed into law,"" Anderson said."
breitbart|"Major League Baseball is moving its All-Star Game from Atlanta in response to a recently passed voting reform law in Georgia, ESPN reports. MLB issued a press release announcing the move on Friday. ESPN""s lead MLB reporter Jeff Passan also shared the news: Last month, Major League Baseball Players Association President Tony Clark said that his union members wanted to relocate the game after Georgia passed the voter reform bill. ""Players are very much aware"" of the Georgia voting bill, Clark told the Boston Globe. ""As it relates to the All-Star Game, we have not had a conversation with the league on that issue – if there is an opportunity to, we would look forward to having that conversation.""

breitbart|"President Joe Biden advanced a false narrative about Georgia""s new election integrity law, claiming that it reduces voting hours, thereby compromising the ability of working-class Americans to go out and vote. This is a clear falsehood, as the law does not change Election Day hours and actually expands access for early voting, as the establishment media outlet, the Washington Post , pointed out in a fact-check, giving the commander-in-chief Four Pinocchios. Biden has spoken sharply against Georgia""s election law, which Gov. Brian Kemp (R) signed last week, repeating many of the talking points touted by far-left members of Congress, even referring to state election integrity efforts as ""un-American"" and ""sick,"" making ""Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle."" ""What I""m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It""s sick. It""s sick … deciding that you""re going to end voting at five o""clock when working people are just getting off work,"" he said during last week""s news conference. The following day, Biden claimed the law ended voting hours early ""so working people can""t cast their vote after their shift is over."" However, Biden""s assertions are not accurate. Election Day hours in Georgia, which are 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., have not changed. Those in line by 7 p.m. are permitted to cast their vote. ""Nothing in the new law changes those rules,"" the Washington Post  reported . Georgia""s law did, however, make changes to early voting, but the Post explained that experts said the ""net effect was to expand the opportunities to vote for most Georgians, not limit them"": Ultimately, the Post issued Four Pinocchios to Biden""s claim, emphasizing Election Day hours were not changed and the early voting changes actually expand access, as Heritage Action pointed out amid the left""s steam of false characterizations last week: ""President Biden""s misleading attacks are not supported by the facts: Georgia""s election reforms actually expand voting opportunities, extend early voting hours, and reduce wait times while promoting trust in the state""s election system,"" Heritage Action executive director Jessica Anderson told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement. ""Over 80 percent of Americans support these commonsense measures to protect our elections and uphold a fair, transparent voting process,"" she continued, explaining that groups opposing basic voter protections are ""actually sowing mistrust and suppressing Georgian votes."" ""Georgia""s reforms increase voter confidence and should be the example for every state on how to make it easy to vote and hard to cheat,"" Anderson added.

breitbart|"Georgia""s newest election law ""cures a lot of the problems"" seen in the 2020 election, said Gov. Brian Kemp (R-GA) on Monday""s edition of SiriusXM""s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow, author of Breaking the News: Exposing the Establishment Media""s Hidden Deals and Secret Corruption . Kemp remarked, ""The nuts and bolts of the law are this, it makes it easy to vote and hard to cheat. The biggest — probably the top four things to me — is it replaces a signature match with a voter ID on absentee ballots. It secures ballot drop boxes around the clock. It also requires poll workers to continue tabulating ballots until all votes are counted and then it actually — contrary to what the national media and those that are profiting off of this whole exercise of not being truthful with people — expands voting access, especially on the weekends."" LISTEN : Marlow asked about left-wing news media reports framing Georgia""s election law as a denial of water donations to voters at polling stations. CNN declared , ""It""s now illegal in Georgia to give food and water to voters in line."" The Washington Post echoed the same narrative in a column titled , ""Opinion: Georgia Republicans"" ban on giving voters water epitomizes the GOP""s disturbing priorities."" Kemp responded, ""Basically, the bill bans private funding for elections and secures the precinct areas against non-voting activities, s o that voters that are within 150 feet of the polling location … can""t be intimidated or bothered while they""re standing in line. It doesn""t prevent the county elections offices from having a water cooler."" Kemp continued, ""It just keeps the NRA or Sierra Club or whatever special interest group — and people that are running for office — from handing out food or water in the line, so it""s not as outrageous as people are making it out to be. And outside that 150 feet, if campaigns want to wave signs, if they want to set up tables, hand out water or whatever, they can certainly do that."" Marlow said he has witnessed intimidation attempts at polling station lineups. ""I have had some very aggressive people very close to the polls trying to influence my vote,"" he shared. ""I""m sure many people the audience have experienced that. We have an editor who ran for Congress about ten years or so ago, and his opponent, who won, was giving out candy at the polls. … W ater is, of course, very innocuous, but you can see the slippery slope getting out of control pretty quickly."" Drop boxes for ballots, which Kemp said were introduced last year as a public health measure in Georgia, would now be monitored and shielded from non-governmental funding. In 2020, Mark Zuckerberg spent $400 million on an operation — which was praised by left-wing  media as a security measure — to fund ballot drop boxes in various localities. Kemp said, ""If you look at some of the national stories about drop boxes, you""d think that we were just loading them all up in a truck to junk them, when drop boxes were never even allowed in our state before the 2020 election, and the only reason they were done this election was was because of a public health state of emergency and a worldwide pandemic and an emergency order that the state elections board did."" ""We""re putting drop boxes into the law,"" he continued. ""Now, every county has to have a drop box. You had some counties last election that didn""t even have a drop box. Now they""re going to be mandated to have one, but yes, we""re securing the drop boxes 24 hours a day to make sure that you don""t have people dumping ballots in them at inappropriate times, and the left is making that out like we""re taking something away."" Kemp remarked, ""Looking back, the drop boxes were a concern for people because they were supposed to be secured with cameras 24 hours a day. That did not happen in some counties."" Kemp described reforms to absentee voting in Georgia, which now require absentee voters to verify their identities with driver""s licenses or other documentation. Absentee ballots cast last year were verified through signature comparisons and did not require voter ID. Election officials were ""overwhelmed"" by absentee ballots and the signature verification process in 2020, Kemp said. He added, ""Everybody is just having a fit about voter ID requirements for absentee voting, at least the left and the national media. But really the county elections officials I""ve talked to, they like the idea of the federal ID — or putting the numbers of your driver""s license or your free voter ID you can get in Georgia on your absentee ballot, because it""ll help them speed up the process.""  The bill ""cures a lot of the problems that we saw in the last election,"" Kemp concluded."
breitbart|"Heritage Action debunked six key myths touted by Democrats regarding Georgia""s recently-passed election integrity law, which the radical left has falsely described as a voter suppression bill harkening to the era of Jim Crow. The left has continued to mischaracterize the SB 202, which Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) signed into law last week, ushering in basic election integrity measures such as requiring a valid ID to vote via an absentee ballot. However, influential Democrats, including President Joe Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), have continued to spread a series of falsehoods regarding state election integrity efforts across the nation, as well as the Georgia law specifically. Schumer even called such proposals ""one of the greatest threats we have to modern democracy in America."" Heritage Action has continued to address the narrative and released a ""Myth vs. Fact"" sheet combating the top myths touted by Democrats. The organization identified the voter suppression narrative as one of the primary myths and explained the Georgia bill ""actually preserves or expands ballot access in several important ways,"" including by increasing the mandatory days for early weekend voting: Democrats also claim the law eliminates ""Souls to the Polls,"" suppressing minority votes, but this, again, is false. Heritage Action explained the Georgia law ""was silent on Sunday early voting days prior to SB 202, and in 2020 only 16 of 159 counties offered early voting on Sundays."" In reality, the law ""explicitly provides the option of holding early voting on two Sundays for all localities,"" thereby increasing mandatory days of early weekend voting. Heritage Action also tackled the myth of Georgia ""suppressing"" votes with new voter ID requirements , noting the vast majority of registered voters, 97 percent, already have a valid form of identification and adding that one can be obtained for free. ""The voter ID requirement replaces the state""s controversial signature match program that led to the disqualification of thousands of votes in 2020,"" the organization said, noting the tremendous popularity of the voter ID requirement for absentee ballots among Peach State voters, with nearly three-quarters of Georgia voters supporting it, including 63 percent of black voters. The organization also tackled the critiques over drop boxes for absentee voting, reminding voters the drop boxes used in 2020 did ""not exist a year ago."" Under SB 202, they become an official part of Georgia elections, available across all counties and under supervision. Other myths debunked, via Heritage Action: Nonetheless, leftists are continuing to urge influential persons and entities to fight against state election integrity efforts . Dozens of black business leaders recently signed a letter, urging corporations to use their influence to sway lawmakers. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian followed suit, criticizing Georgia""s election integrity law as ""unacceptable"" in a memo to employees on Wednesday."
slate|"In March, Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed into law sweeping new restrictions regulating the right to vote. Among the attacks on suffrage is a provision that invalidates provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct during working hours. For those old enough to remember, this provision evokes painful memories of Florida""s "" meltdown "" in the 2000 presidential election. And for those who were still paying attention when Congress passed the Help America Vote Act two years later, it raises the question: How can we possibly still be invalidating provisional ballots? The 2000 election is now best remembered for hanging chads, butterfly ballots, and the Supreme Court""s decision in Bush v. Gore . But lurking beneath these more prominent controversies was yet another failure in the state""s election administration. Florida, it turned out, had erroneously removed thousands of voters from the rolls due to a name-matching error in its election software that mistakenly classified too many voters as felons. When these voters arrived at their local precincts on Election Day, they were turned away, bewildered. Florida, like many states at the time, did not provide provisional ballots—that is, ballots that voters whose registration is in doubt may cast and later have reviewed for eligibility. So when poll place volunteers turned these voters away, there was no backup option for capturing their votes. A daily email update of the stories you need to read right now. Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. Florida was not alone. Following the 2000 election, researchers at Caltech and MIT found that as many as 3 million voters across the country may have been disenfranchised due to voter registration mishaps. Yet provisional ballots were available in only one-third of states. Another study suggested that if the ""aggressive use of provisional ballots"" had been in place during the 2000 election, up to 1.5 million votes could have been saved. With this data in hand, Congress passed the Help America Vote Act, or HAVA, in 2002 to help solve the problem. The bill had broad bipartisan support, passing the Senate on a vote of 92–2. HAVA created a ""fail-safe"" that requires states to offer provisional ballots to any voter whose registration is in doubt on Election Day, but who signs an affidavit affirming they are eligible to vote. That should have been the end of the story: Provisional ballots ought to have become a reliable safeguard against administrative error in American elections, saving more than 1 million votes a year. Instead, provisional ballots have become a mainstay of U.S. elections only insofar as they can be counted on to generate controversy. Provisional ballots nearly caused a Florida redux in 2004 and, as Georgia""s new law illustrates, they remain a source of debate today. What happened? Just two years after President George W. Bush signed HAVA into law, provisional ballots nearly became the hanging chads of the 2004 election. That election, in which Bush ran for a second term against Sen. John Kerry, turned on the outcome in Ohio. When America awoke on Nov. 3 of that year, Bush led in Ohio by 136,000 votes, with 153,000 provisional ballots still outstanding. A flurry of lawsuits sprang to life about how to count those ballots, but, recognizing an insurmountable margin, Kerry conceded the election. Had the result been closer, though, the Supreme Court may have been forced to resolve a second consecutive presidential election. Kerry himself did not challenge the outcome of the 2004 election, but lawsuits over provisional ballots proceeded in Ohio and other states. It is the outcome of those lawsuits that explains how states like Georgia have continued to resist the adoption of provisional ballots. The provisional ballot litigation in 2004 was ultimately resolved on a technicality. A careful read of HAVA""s text reveals that the law requires states to permit voters to "" cast "" provisional ballots. But as courts in Ohio , Florida , and Colorado pointed out, it does not require states to count those ballots. So, according to the courts, HAVA creates a right to cast a provisional ballot; it does not create a right to have that provisional ballot counted . The upshot is that states, many of which opposed HAVA""s provisional ballot requirement to begin with, have been able to impose restrictions on provisional ballots that, like Georgia""s, render many provisional votes meaningless. Indeed, according to the Election Assistance Commission, of the nearly 2.5 million provisional ballots cast in the 2016 presidential election, nearly 25 percent were rejected. (2020 data is not yet available.) Many of these ballots are invalidated by what are known as ""wrong precinct"" restrictions. Under these rules, if a voter casts a provisional ballot in the wrong precinct—even if they are otherwise eligible and voting in a federal election for which precinct has no bearing on eligibility—their ballot is rejected. Georgia""s new law imposes just such a requirement, instructing poll workers to turn away voters who arrive at the wrong polling place and invalidating any provisional ballot cast from the wrong precinct before 5 p.m. Requiring voters to show up at the proper precinct may seem like a small ask. But, for many reasons, it can be more complicated than it appears. Consider a few common scenarios. First, voters who move counties in the lead-up to an election may be unsure whether they are supposed to vote in their old precinct or their new one. Second, poll closures can cause confusion about where a voter whose precinct has been shut down is required to appear. This problem is particularly acute in Georgia; the state has shuttered hundreds of polling places (disproportionately in Black communities) since the Supreme Court""s 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder  gutting the Voting Rights Act . Third, the ""right church, wrong pew"" problem can result in the simplest of mistakes: A voter arrives at the correct polling place but, because the site serves as a poll place for multiple precincts, goes to the wrong table and therefore casts an out-of-precinct ballot. But it is not only voter error that generates out-of-precinct ballots. Mistakes by the state and by poll workers can result in inaccurate information on Election Day. Recall the Florida error in 2000. Because the state furnished poll workers with inaccurate registration lists, eligible voters attempting to vote in the correct precinct were turned away. States invariably make similar voter registration errors that lead poll workers to believe, incorrectly, that voters are not registered in a particular precinct. And volunteer poll workers make mistakes as well. In an infamous Ohio case , for example, a poll worker directed a voter to the wrong precinct because the worker mistakenly believed the voter""s address, 798, was an odd number. (The volunteer later claimed in a deposition that 798 was odd because it contained more odd numbers than even ones.) An Ohio court ordered the state to count the votes invalidated due to poll worker error. But there would be no remedy under the new Georgia law for a voter who, having been improperly turned away after an hourslong wait at one precinct, decided to go home rather than making the journey to another poll site. Invalidating provisional ballots matters—not only because counting every eligible vote is a basic tenet of democracy, but also because provisional ballots may affect electoral outcomes. Georgia received over 21,000 provisional ballots in the 2018 election, nearly double the vote differential between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in the 2020 election. And Florida, where our story began, was decided by 537 votes in 2000; it received over 13,000 provisional ballots in 2018. Counting provisional ballots, then, is not only necessary as a democratic value—it is a precondition to accurate electoral outcomes. So how, 20 years after Congress recognized the importance of provisional ballots, do we finally ensure that no eligible voter is disenfranchised because of Election Day mishaps? The For the People Act , which passed the House in March and now has a companion introduced in the Senate, would finally deliver that basic promise. In language that clearly reflects a lesson learned, the act requires state election officials to "" count each vote"" cast on a provisional ballot by an eligible voter, ""notwithstanding the precinct or polling place at which a provisional ballot is cast."" Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin seemed to sign the death warrant for the current version of the For the People Act when he wrote in the Washington Post , ""There is no circumstance in which I will vote to eliminate or weaken the filibuster."" But he also expressed his expectation that Congress would take ""bipartisan action on voting reform."" Counting provisional ballots should be a source of that agreement. In the wake of Bush v. Gore , a bipartisan Congress united to vote on a bill that they believed would ensure ""no American qualified to vote anywhere in her or his state"" would ""be turned away from a polling place in that state."" But the right to cast a ballot does not much matter without the right to have it counted. So while the For the People Act has become a lightning rod for partisan controversy, giving this one right some meaning ought to be a source of common ground. Congress should come together and do just that. Slate is covering the stories that matter to you. Become a Slate Plus member to support our work. Your first month is only $1."

slate|"When Gov. Brian Kemp signed Georgia""s new restrictive voting provisions into law, he claimed the controversial changes—including making it harder to request mail ballots and use drop boxes—are necessary to improve election security . These bills, of course, spring from the Big Lie about our elections, but there is another irony here. Much of the ""election integrity"" legislation in Georgia and around the country would actually weaken our election systems and reduce their capacity to recover from a technological problem, whether a malfunction or an attack. During the 2020 election, the increased variety in voting methods and the longer time frame for voting meant that, in many states, election officials were handling smaller groups of voters and ballots at once than they were in past elections. If a technological problem arose, the reduced crowds made it easier to diagnose and solve the problem and get voters voting again. For example, during early voting in 2020, Georgia""s statewide voter registration database was having trouble handling the logins of election staff across the state. The problem caused extremely long lines . Georgia officials weren""t able to fix it immediately, but within a few days the issue was addressed, lines improved, and voters who might have not been able to stand in long lines because of work or other obligations still had opportunities to cast their ballot. If there had only been one or two days for in-person voting, those voters might not have had another chance. And the lines would have been even longer, with many more voters showing up to cast their ballot at once. Many of the so-called election integrity bills would reduce the availability of ballot drop boxes— one bill in Florida would eliminate them entirely. During the 2020 election, drop boxes were a convenient voting option for many people who might have been concerned about the reliability of the post office: Voters could drop their absentee ballot into a nearby box instead of showing up to polling places on Election Day. This helped reduce the lines at polling places for those voters who preferred or needed the in-person option instead. Drop boxes helped all voters—absentee and in-person—by making sure they didn""t all show up to the polling place on Election Day, which would have made it harder for poll workers to deal with inevitable technical problems or cyberattacks. Even if fears of delays with the postal system subside in the future, cyberattacks or staffing cuts could result in slow mail service, or election officials could have trouble  processing ballot requests quickly, leading to delays in voters receiving their ballots in time to mail them back. Drop boxes will help ensure the resiliency of the system. And finally, bills being introduced attacking same-day voter registration undermine the recovery capabilities these systems provide for two of the biggest  vulnerabilities in U.S. elections: voter registration databases and electronic poll books. Many of them—including in Georgia—are not formally  certified to any security standards. This makes them more vulnerable to cyberattacks or breakdowns. When registration is required in order to be eligible to vote, attacks on the registration lists can have a devastating effect, impeding the ability of election workers to check in voters at polling places or process their mail ballots. Same-day registration is a fail-safe—even if the list is compromised, voters can register on the day they show up to vote and cast their ballots. While the push to restrict voting and undermine election security is disheartening, the crush of new bills—as of March 24, legislators had introduced 361 bills  with restrictive provisions in 47 states—has pushed Congress to take action. The House passed the For the People Act, which includes crucial election reforms, and the bill has been introduced in the Senate. The For the People Act would create a national standard for voting access and security by, among other things, ensuring minimum requirements for early voting, voting by mail, drop boxes, and same-day registration. The bill would have other election security benefits, including replacing insecure paperless voting machines (which are still used in seven states) and promoting postelection audits to build confidence in results. The For the People Act would cancel out many of the worst restrictions on voting access that have been introduced or become law. But can it pass through the Senate and reverse these regressive efforts? There are certainly real challenges. Senate Democratic leaders  are on record saying the filibuster cannot be an impediment to its passage. But even before they figure that out, they must get Democratic holdout Sen. Joe Manchin on board. He says he supports many of the bill""s provisions but would prefer to find a bipartisan solution. Given how far apart the two sides are, a major compromise seems dubious. None of this means the bill can""t pass. Indeed, the brazen attempts by state lawmakers to undermine voting rights—and consequently election security—just might force the hands of both Manchin and Congress into passing For the People Act, resulting in a long overdue national baseline for voter access and election security.

slate|"Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed a sweeping voter suppression bill into law on Thursday in a closed-door ceremony attended by fellow white Republicans. When Rep. Park Cannon, a Black Democrat, tried to attend the ceremony, she was arrested and charged with two felonies. The new law, S.B. 202 , is a direct response to Democrats"" recent victories in Georgia, and targets the Black communities that helped Democratic candidates secure those wins. Republicans were able to pass the law only because, in 2013""s Shelby County v. Holder , the Supreme Court freed the state from direct oversight under the Voting Rights Act. In Shelby County , Chief Justice John Roberts notoriously declared that racism is now so vanishingly rare that Congress cannot justify the VRA""s most stringent infringement on ""the equal sovereignty of the states."" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg""s celebrated dissent did not merely refute Roberts"" decision; it accurately predicted the wave of voter suppression laws that followed in its wake. S.B. 202 may be the most perverse vindication of Ginsburg""s prophecy yet. It is precisely the kind of Jim Crow–style attack on democracy that the justice anticipated nearly eight years ago. A daily email update of the stories you need to read right now. Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. Shelby County dismantled the centerpiece of the VRA, its preclearance requirement. Under this provision, states with a history of racist voter suppression could not alter their election laws without approval from the Department of Justice or a federal court in D.C. Preclearance, which Congress overwhelmingly reauthorized in 2006, had blocked countless efforts to diminish racial minorities"" electoral impact. Yet, in Shelby County , Roberts decided that Congress had failed to prove its continued necessity. To support this conclusion, he cited statistics showing that Black voter participation had surged in the South, proving that ""things have changed dramatically."" Roberts"" opinion rests on an indefensible , made-up rationale that favors an abstract and artificial  conception of states"" rights over Congress"" constitutional authority to outlaw race-based voting discrimination—the same approach, ironically, that required the VRA""s passage in the first place. It also just doesn""t make any sense; as Ginsburg famously explained Roberts"" illogic in her dissent: ""Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet."" After Shelby County, as state after state passed draconian restrictions on the right to vote and shuttered thousands of polling places —all of which disproportionately disenfranchised voters of color —Ginsburg""s umbrella quip has become perhaps the most accurate prognostication in modern Supreme Court history. Even more impressively, Ginsburg anticipated exactly the kind of laws that Republicans around the country are currently passing . The VRA successfully abolished what she called ""first-generation"" barriers to ballot access, like literacy and jelly bean tests . In recent decades, however, ""second-generation barriers to minority voting rights have emerged"" as substitutes. Ginsburg continued: The sad irony of today""s decision lies in its utter failure to grasp why the VRA has proven effective. The Court appears to believe that the VRA""s success in eliminating the specific devices extant in 1965 means that preclearance is no longer needed. With that belief, and the argument derived from it, history repeats itself. … In truth, the evolution of voting discrimination into more subtle second-generation barriers is powerful evidence that a remedy as effective as preclearance remains vital to protect minority voting rights and prevent backsliding. In essence, Ginsburg viewed voter suppression as a virus that will continually mutate to overcome each effort to suppress it. When left untreated, it will replicate endlessly until it kills its host. In its early form, the virus of voter suppression was obvious. Congress held it in check, more or less, with preclearance. After the Supreme Court removed that strong medicine, it mutated into a ""more subtle"" yet still dangerous second generation. Yet the voter suppression measures that Georgia implemented in light of Shelby County , including poll closures in Black communities , were not enough to kill democracy in the state; Democrats, after all, were still able to win elections. With S.B. 202, the virus has mutated into an even more lethal form. Consider how several different components of the law interact. S.B. 202 strictly limits the number of ballot drop boxes counties can offer, and requires them to be located within early voting sites. The boxes may only be accessible when those sites are open. The bill also prohibits the use of drop boxes starting four days before an election—which is when voters need them most, since a ballot that is mailed at that point may not arrive on time. It shortens the voting period for runoff races and sharply curtails early voting for runoffs. And it compels some counties , including those with large Black communities, to reduce their early voting hours. These provisions all guarantee longer lines at the polls, even though Georgians—especially those of color— already wait for hours to cast their ballots. And here is the twist that elevates S.B. 202 above today""s garden-variety voter suppression laws: The law makes it a crime for volunteers to pass out food or water to voters waiting in those endless lines. Georgia Republicans have forced voters to stand outside for hours and, to make the experience as unpleasant as possible, forbidden anyone from providing them with basic sustenance to help them stay in line for as long as it takes. The inevitable consequence of this assault on the right to vote: A significant number of would-voters in predominantly Black, Democratic areas will simply give up. Voting rights advocates have already filed suit against S.B. 202, but there is virtually no chance that this ultraconservative Supreme Court will block any provision of the law. Were it not for Shelby County , Merrick Garland""s Justice Department would have stopped this bill in its tracks. Instead, the infection Ginsburg warned us about may kill Georgia""s democracy for good. Slate is covering the stories that matter to you. Become a Slate Plus member to support our work.

slate|"Subscribe to What Next on Apple Podcasts for the full episode. There are now 253 bills in 43 states that aim to restrict voting access, according to a recent report by the Brennan Center for Justice. That""s a lot of bills, in just the past two months. Even Ari Berman , a reporter at Mother Jones who""s been covering voting rights for a decade, says, ""I""ve never seen anything like this before."" Republicans are behind this new wave of voting restrictions, and they control most statehouses across the country. On Thursday""s episode of What Next , I spoke to Berman about how they""re justifying voter suppression and how Democrats can fight back at the state and federal levels. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. Ari Berman: Georgia is fascinating because Republicans wrote every aspect of the state""s voting laws, so they were totally fine with it until it didn""t work for them anymore. And the second it didn""t work for them, now they""re trying to change the entire thing. They can""t say this voting law or that voting law is a Democratic plot because they did all of it. Every press release from the Georgia secretary of state brags that Georgia is a national leader in elections because it has the trifecta of automatic voter registration, early voting, and no-excuse absentee voting. And Republicans have now introduced and passed bills through committee to repeal or restrict all three of those things. They have passed bills through committee to repeal automatic voter registration, which 5 million of 7.6 million registered voters in Georgia use to register. They have passed bills through committee to repeal no-excuse absentee voting, which 1.3 million Georgians used in November. They have tried to cut days of weekend voting, including Sunday voting, when Black churches used ""souls to the polls"" voter mobilization drives. So they really are trying to repeal or severely restrict everything in the state of Georgia that makes it easy to vote. These are not small changes around the margins. These are sweeping changes that would dramatically reshape and restrict voting access in the state. Mary Harris: It""s notable that not all Georgia Republicans agree these restrictions are necessary, or even a good idea politically. There""s different dividing lines. The speaker of the House said he doesn""t want to get rid of no-excuse absentee voting. That is not in any of the House bills so far that have been passed to restrict voting rights. The lieutenant governor, who presides over the Senate, is not for that either. Gov. Brian Kemp has been vague about what he wants to do, but I think he is very aware of the fact that most likely Stacey Abrams is going to run against him in 2022. And a lot of Democrats, and in particular a lot of Black voters, are still angry about the voter suppression that happened in 2018 when Brian Kemp was both secretary of state and a candidate for governor and appeared to use the state""s voting laws as a weapon against Stacey Abrams and a weapon against Black voters. And so I think he realizes if he signs bills making it harder to vote, that Abrams and other people in Georgia are going to use that against him for the next two years. They""re going to rally voters against him and they""re going to say the governor, the Republican leadership of the state, they don""t want Black voters to participate, they don""t want voters of color to participate. And that may mobilize people to turn out again and to be motivated to not have their votes taken away from them. So it""s unclear how this is going to work politically, but it""s also clear that the legislature, in some form or another, is going to pass laws making it more difficult to vote based on zero evidence that it actually needs to happen. What do the efforts look like to stop these Republican laws from passing? When it comes to the Democrats, how can they insert themselves here, given that they""re not part of the majority? First off, just publicity. I mean, there was a truck that was circling the Georgia legislature on Friday that had a banner that said ""Georgia Republicans don""t want Black people to vote."" And this is a state where voters of color are 40 percent of the electorate. Georgia was the only state in which Black people made up a majority of Joe Biden""s voters. So Black voters and voters of color are a very influential segment of the electorate in Georgia. A lot of times voter suppression succeeds because people don""t know it""s going on. They""re able to pass it under the rug and just think that there won""t be any outrage because people won""t really be following it. That""s not going to happen in Georgia. That""s not going to happen in other states. This is getting a lot of attention at the state level. This is starting to get more attention nationally. And Democrats are able to both make a stink about it, but also they""re able to exploit these Republican divides and say, ""It was your Republican secretary of state that said over and over and over this election was secure, there was no fraud, Donald Trump and other people who were allied with him were lying."" That makes for a pretty effective argument. Looking nationally, there are also 704 bills with provisions to improve access to voting. It seems like that would be good news. It would be good news if all of those bills to improve voting rights actually had the same chance of passing as all the bills to restrict voting rights do. Because if you look at who controls the states right now, Republicans control many more states than Democrats do. So bills to make voting easier, by and large, are only going to pass in Democratic-controlled states. But if you look at all the places that Republicans control—Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Texas—they are very, very quickly moving to restrict voting rights. It is the No. 1 thing or very close to the No. 1 thing they""re trying to do in all of these states that are competitive—or even not really that competitive. The amazing thing to me is that you have Idaho and Wyoming and Montana, all of these states that Donald Trump carried easily, they""re also making it harder to vote. So it just seems like this voter suppression virus has infected the entire Republican Party. They are doing this all across the country, and it""s really remarkable to see how orchestrated it is. It""s almost like their ability to do voter suppression has become a litmus test for how loyal of Republicans they are—like pushing voter suppression is now the same thing as being pro-life or pro-gun. If you don""t do it, you""re not a loyal Republican, you""re a RINO. And that""s so disturbing. The idea that restricting access to the ballot is now something that you have to do to prove your loyalty to the Republican Party and prove your loyalty to Trump is just an incredibly alarming and I think new development in American politics. They""re just so insecure in terms of the power they have that even if they won the election, they clearly don""t believe that they""re going to win it forever, or else they wouldn""t be changing the voting systems in Iowa or Florida and other states. Get more news from Mary Harris and her team every day. Let""s talk about what might happen if these bills are passed. In the past, the courts have stepped in to intervene, especially with something like restricting Sunday voting—North Carolina tried to pass a similar law in 2013. Courts got in there and said no. Can we expect that to happen now? I don""t have a whole lot of faith in the courts, when Donald Trump appointed 234 judges, including three new members of the Supreme Court. I think that the courts are going to be very lenient towards these Republican efforts. There may be a few really extreme provisions that they strike down. But on the whole, I think the courts are going to say that we think states should be able to run their elections how they see fit. So if the courts aren""t going to fix this, what will? I think federal legislation. Democrats control Washington. They""re in a position to pass a new Voting Rights Act. They""re in a position to pass the For the People Act, the most important democracy reform bill in a generation. They have the power to do these things. If there""s any way to try to stop this, it""s to create federal rules to make it easier to vote. What""s in the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act? The For the People Act has all of these provisions that would make it easier to vote, because Congress can regulate the rules for federal elections. So it would mandate that every state for federal elections would have automatic registration, would have Election Day registration, would have early voting, would have nonpartisan redistricting, would give voting rights back to people with past felony convictions. So, many of the things that we""re talking about Republicans trying to do, they wouldn""t be able to do for federal elections because the For the People Act would have these broad protections for voting rights enshrined for races for the House or the Senate or for the president. And that would go a long way to blocking the kind of voter suppression efforts we""re talking about in the states. How does the John Lewis Voting Rights Act push even beyond that? The John Lewis Voting Rights Act responds to the Shelby County v. Holder decision, where the Supreme Court in 2013 said that states with a long history of discrimination no longer have to approve their voting changes with the federal government. In that decision, the Supreme Court basically said to Congress: You can write a new version of the Voting Rights Act. One of our biggest issues with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is it""s based on old data. So the John Lewis Voting Rights Act would require states with a more recent history of voting discrimination to have to approve their voting changes with the federal government once again. That would include states like Georgia that both discriminated against voters of color in the past but have also discriminated against them more recently, as found by the courts. And so if Georgia wanted to get rid of automatic registration or get rid of early voting or do something like that, they would have to get that approved with the federal government, either with the courts or the Justice Department. It would also require voting changes in every state that have a disproportionate impact on minority voters to have to be approved federally as well. So if you""re in Utah and you want to close a polling place in an area with a high percentage of voters of color, you would have to get that approved as well. So it""s both sweeping and targeted at the same time. And I think these bills work really well hand in hand, because the For the People Act would basically do all these good things, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act would basically stop all of these bad things. I think you need that combination of carrots and sticks to really protect voting rights in this day and age. My understanding is these two bills are alive in the House, but not so alive in the Senate. They""re alive in the Senate if you can pass them with 50 votes. They are alive if you get rid of the filibuster to pass them. Right now, Joe Manchin, Kyrsten Sinema, they""re saying we""re not going to get rid of the filibuster. So they""re dead as of now. What Democrats are betting is that if Republicans block enough legislation and if Republicans do enough extreme things at the state level, these senators might change their tune. In Arizona, Kyrsten Sinema""s home state, they have introduced more restrictions on voting than any other state, even more than in Georgia. They""re trying to roll back mail voting in all sorts of ways. They""re trying to cut in-person voting. They""re trying to get rid of automatic registration. There""s even a bill in Arizona that would allow the Legislature there to appoint its own electors no matter what the voters do, so basically that would render the presidential election completely void if the Legislature can just step in at any moment to overturn it. So I think at some level, Kyrsten Sinema and other Democrats in Arizona have to view these as an attack on democracy, but also as an attack on them , an attack on their ability to get reelected. They also know that the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the For the People Act would stop a lot of these efforts. And so these federal bills, yes, they""re not going to pass the Senate now. Democrats are betting that in six months, the political situation, the political calculus of these senators, might be different. Get more news from Mary Harris every weekday."
slate|"After historic Black turnout flipped Georgia and sent two Democrats to the Senate, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed a new law that could hit Black and other voters of color hard. Now the army of activists who turned Georgia blue are battling to keep it that way. On Friday""s episode of A Word , I spoke to LaTosha Brown about the situation. She is the co-founder of Black Voters Matter, one of the groups that helped Democrats win Georgia at the Senate and presidential level. We discussed how activists are fighting back against this new controversial law. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Jason Johnson:  So I just want to start with this: Did you all think that this was going to happen no matter what? Did you think that Brian Kemp was always going to sign laws like this? Had it always been in the hopper, or do you think it was a direct response to Democrats doing so well in the state last November? LaTosha Brown: If you know the history of the South, and voting behavior in the South, anytime there has been a Black advancement or Black people have showed up, we""ve seen a white backlash in some form or fashion—something punitive that normally comes up to try to prevent or marginalize our voice and our votes. And so, on one hand, there was something to be expected. We had this historic turnout in this last election cycle. I don""t think we knew that they would go that far. Now, mind you, this is a state that both the entire legislative branch and the governor""s office, those are all Republicans. Fulton County is a county where you have a sizable Black population. Atlanta is a majority Black city. DeKalb County is a majority Black county. And so those were the counties, quite frankly, that made the difference in this election cycle, which was propelled primarily by Black voters, with other voters as well, particularly communities of color. But what is so egregious in this bill is that it would give the GOP the ability to take over power from the secretary of state. And so now within this bill, it will take over the secretary of state""s office and will actually take over power of the board of elections in the different counties. So DeKalb County and Fulton County, which they could not control, because you do have Black leadership in those places, they""ve basically essentially given themselves power that they can actually just nullify and say, ""We don""t agree with the results."" Tell us some of the things that you and Black Voters Matter have faced in Georgia. What kind of intimidation, and sometimes government sponsored or vigilante levels of violence, have you faced just trying to organize people to vote? This history of Jim Crow, and this history of how there has always been this parallel of not just voter suppression, but violence, right? That has been inflicted in our communities and directed at Black women. What we""ve seen in South Georgia is that we would pull up… I mean, it was like In the Heat of the Night . We would pull up in these rural communities and at a gas station, and in front of us, the gas station owner would literally take the sign and say closed. He might as well say, ""Negroes are not welcome."" And literally just look at us and close the sign. One trip, we were going from Alabama to Georgia, coming back to Georgia, and the bus windows got burst out. And the white state trooper refused to even go look at the window to file a report. Black officers came, who were with the city police and the local county sheriff""s office. And it was because of them that literally we were actually attended to. Even in Georgia, I""ve gotten unknown, unmarked packages from Russia sent to my house. The bottom line is that it is in that kind of contentious environment that we""ve had to actually hire layers of security as we move around the state. But nevertheless: Can""t stop, won""t stop, we continue to go. A lot of the discussion about Georgia has been putting pressure on businesses. What is the role of putting pressure on Delta or Coca-Cola or Home Depot, or any of these businesses? One, how do you guys do that? Two, is it really effective? Could Home Depot, Delta, or Coca-Cola make a difference in these kinds of laws? So, that""s an excellent question. I think we also have to recognize as organizers, there""s always a relationship between the politics and the economics. And so what we have launched in Georgia is a corporate accountability campaign. We took out a couple of ads, full-page ads, in local newspapers, all across the state, including the ones with the largest circulations, just calling the question. Like, ""Are you standing with the voters of Georgia?"" A few years ago, there was an abortion ban bill in Georgia. And there were corporations and businesses—primarily the film industry took a lot of the lead that time—that said, ""We""re not coming to Georgia. We""re not doing business in Georgia if this is the kind of things that y""all are passing."" We saw the same thing in North Carolina with the bathroom bill. My point is those corporations have an enormous amount of influence and political capital. Tell us a little bit about this slate of Black Fortune 500 CEOs that are out there now doing advocacy work and telling these large businesses that they need to pay attention as well. Number one, I""m going to just lift up that that is what real accountable corporate leadership looks like. To come out and use your power, your space of privilege to say, ""This is wrong, and our company is going to call and speak to that being wrong."" We saw that with Salesforce. Every chance I get, I like to shout out to Salesforce, because they""re not even based in Georgia, and they literally came out with the strongest and the most clear statement around these voter suppression bills in Georgia. These Black CEOs that have come out and said that this voter suppression is unacceptable, and they""re going to use the weight of their companies to really push the defeat of these bills all across the nation, that is something that is critical, that is something that is needed, should be lifted up. And I do think that it""s going to change the trajectory. There""s a real conflict here. Obviously you""ve shown that you can put pressure on a lot of huge Fortune 500 companies to try to change what""s happening with voter suppression in Georgia, but you have other people who say, ""We should just boycott these companies."" Where do you fall on this? Do you think that that corporate pressure on a brand is more effective, or do you think boycotting is the best way to put pressure on state governments to roll back some of these voter suppression laws they""re trying to pass? I don""t know if I think that there""s either/or; I think it""s and . There""s this idea that Black people should only have access to one form of pressure. I think when people are fighting you, and your community is under attack, you should use every single tool that""s available to you. And so the AME Church has actually called for a boycott. And while my organization, in particular, has not called for a boycott, we""re also not telling people not to boycott. We believe that people should make choices of who they spend their money with, their hard-earned money with those companies that align with their values. But we""re also saying that there are other strategies as well. And I think that you have to have all of those tools that are working in concert together to put the pressure and light on folks to make these companies actually step up and stand out.

Brian Kemp""s signing of a new law making it harder to vote. Video of the scene shows Rep. Park Cannon, who is Black, calmly attempting to enter the signing ceremony and subsequent press conference being held in the governor""s Capitol office. Cannon can be seen approaching and lightly knocking on the closed doors before being intercepted by state troopers. In a brief, subdued encounter that was more a mild-mannered registering of protest than a provocation, Cannon was abruptly handcuffed and hauled out of the Capitol.

Despite finding no credible claims of voter fraud or systemic irregularities of any kind in multiple recounts and audits, Georgia Republicans leveraged GOP outrage stemming from Donald Trump""s election fraud fiction. The Georgia law is the first restrictive voting law to pass in a nationwide push by Republicans in the name of ""election integrity."" Some of the most noxious parts of the original bill, like requiring an excuse for voters to vote by mail and cutting weekend early voting hours popular among Democrats, were ultimately stripped due to a Democratic outcry. In addition to a number of inoffensive administrative changes, however, the new law still adds new voter ID requirements for absentee ballots, restricts the use of absentee drop boxes, empowers electors to challenge the eligibility of an unlimited number of voters, and gives state election officials the power to take over local elections boards. The new law also criminalizes distributing food and water to voters waiting in line. Cannon called the law ""Jim Crow in a suit and tie."""
slate|"On Friday, Major League Baseball announced that it""s moving the 2021 All-Star Game and the 2021 MLB Draft out of Georgia , in response to the state""s new voting law, SB 202 . In a statement, Commissioner Rob Manfred said, ""Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box. Fair access to voting continues to have our game""s unwavering support."" The Atlanta Braves, who would have hosted the All-Star Game, responded with a snippy statement of their own, saying that while the ""organization will continue to stress the importance of equal voting opportunities … Unfortunately, businesses, employees, and fans in Georgia are the victims of this decision."" Donald Trump predictably said his followers should boycott baseball , but it wasn""t just the Braves and the Trumpists and Fox News who cast doubt on MLB""s decision. Voting rights activist Stacey Abrams said she was happy that the league and its players spoke out, but that she didn""t support moving the game, a move she said would hurt the state economically. On Tuesday, the league announced the game will be held in Denver instead. On this week""s Hang Up and Listen , Slate""s sports podcast, the hosts discussed the Georgia law, MLB""s decision, and the national reactions to both. A portion of their conversation is transcribed below. It has been edited and condensed for length and clarity. Josh Levin: In 2016, when the NBA announced it was pulling its All-Star Game from Charlotte because of North Carolina""s bigoted trans-bathroom bill, we could say, ""Oh, that""s basketball. That has a younger, more liberal fan base. It""s got a progressive commissioner, Adam Silver, yada yada …"" But baseball has neither a young nor a liberal fan base. Rob Manfred, not known for being progressive. And yeah, we can talk about corporate and sponsor pressure having a lot to do with this decision, but it is worth noting that golf""s PGA Tour announced last week that it""s not moving its season-ending tour championship out of Georgia. So what do you think baseball is doing here? Joel Anderson: I think, like any other large corporation, Major League Baseball was reluctantly dragged into a political fight that it wanted no part of, but simply could not avoid. And a lot of that is because they""re a victim of bad timing. Their All-Star Game just happens to fall this year, at this time, in the midst of this large political fight. So they couldn""t really run from it. And I think the tell of that is this: Anyone who has remotely followed politics in the last year, or even the last 50, knew that Georgia Republicans and Republicans in statehouses all around the country, were going to rush through a series of so-called voter reform laws, right? They telegraphed this the whole damn time, including when people were running up into the Capitol, complaining about a stolen election. This was all telegraphed. We knew this was coming and nobody said anything. Right? There wasn""t any of this talk about a boycott or anything before that. They""re acting like this is something new. So when Georgia legislators were meeting and drafting this bill, there was plenty of time for everyone to speak up and say, ""Hey, this is wrong. We don""t support it. And if it passes, we""re prepared to take action."" The MLB, Coca-Cola, Delta, Chick-fil-A—but not Chick-fil-A, because I""m sure they side with the bill as it is—but they all could have said this in February. They could have applied pressure before the law passed, let everyone know what the political economic stakes were there. But they didn""t. And now everyone is scrambling here at the 13 th hour. So, you know, I guess the league has been clearly headed in this direction. Last summer, they delivered a statement about Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd and Breonna Taylor . They talked about how the game has zero tolerance for racism and racial injustice. They""re featuring Black and brown players as the faces of the game. They know what the predictions about the country""s demographics are. They can""t afford to be dragged into the future, but to be honest, it doesn""t matter what Major League Baseball believes. The important thing is that they""re putting their money where their mouths are. I don""t want to belittle or diminish this decision, because I think it actually is meaningful, but I just do wish that they had been ahead of this. There was an opportunity to get ahead of it, and now they""re behind it. And now they""re dealing with the political fallout. Stefan Fatsis: So I think that Major League Baseball acted the way a big, entrenched, politically divided sport in America, that isn""t the NBA, is going to act. They were reading tea leaves in February, right? They were probably hoping that this bill would not pass, that this wouldn""t happen and they wouldn""t be put in a difficult position. But once they were put in this difficult position, they kind of did the right thing here. And I think that does deserve some credit. I think this is better than baseball saying, ""We don""t want to get involved in politics,"" or, ""We support everyone""s right to vote, but we feel like we""ve made a commitment to Atlanta and the Braves to stage the All-Star Game there this year."" I think baseball looked at this and said, ""Fuck it. These people aren""t worth it. Why get on the wrong side of everybody else here?"" This was a position that is supportable. It is palatable. It does not make baseball look like reactionaries. And the downside is pretty small. Levin: Well, the downside, I think, is one that, for instance, the NFL and NFL team owners didn""t want. Back when Donald Trump was president and they were deciding what to do about the racial justice protests, that downside was becoming a kind of pariah in conservative media and in conservative circles. I mean, it""s not just Donald Trump. It""s Tucker Carlson, it""s Fox News, it""s Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. And for an organization like Major League Baseball, which does have as a major part of its ownership and constituency people that align with conservatism and who do skew older. This isn""t something that Major League Baseball has any interest in being involved in. And there is a different way forward here, that the PGA Tour, I think, is trying to tow a very different line on and putting out a statement that""s like, ""We believe in voting rights, but also we""re not going to move our championship."" And they could have chosen that different path and aligned themselves with Stacey Abrams and said, ""We don""t believe that this is right. We think it""s wrong. We stand strongly against it. But we also don""t believe in punishing the good people of Georgia. And we""re not going to run from this fight. We""re going to come be there and be involved in this and speak out against it from this place where we have a team and where we have this huge potential event in July, where we can make that a centerpiece."" And so they chose. It""s not like they had no options here, Joel. Anderson: Yeah. Well, and I""m sort of curious, maybe you guys can help answer this for me: Are people sort of overstating the economic argument here? Because do people really come into town from all over the country, in the middle of a pandemic, for an All-Star Game? We know that when municipalities and towns and cities host these events, it ends up costing those areas more money than they end up getting in terms of economic benefit. We""re just taking them at face value that this is going to hurt them economically too, I think. Maybe it""s a great showcase for the city on TV, but like who in the hell isn""t aware of Atlanta? You know what I mean? Like nobody is going to watch the All-Star Game and be like, ""Wow, I wasn""t thinking about Atlanta before, but now I see it on TV. This must be great."" So I think to me, at least, people are overstating the economic implications, but maybe I""m wrong about that. Fatsis: No, no, no. You""re absolutely right. I mean, the economic implications of one game over a weekend with some ancillary Fan Zone and hotel sales are totally overblown. This is zero-sum stuff, right? If there were no All-Star Game, the way there is going to be no All-Star Game in every other major league city this summer, there is no lost economic benefit here to the city, frankly. Levin: It would bring attention, and maybe that""s part of Major League Baseball""s calculus. Fatsis: Sure. Levin: OK. It might sound good in the moment to be like, ""We""re not going to cancel this because we""re going to stay and fight for what we believe in,"" but do they really want their showcase game and event of the summer—where all the stars that they""re highlighting in these commercials are going to be—do they want that whole thing to turn into some sort of public service announcement about voting rights, where like Fernando Tatís Jr. and Ronald Acuña and Mike Trout, instead of being asked about their feats on the field are asked, ""What do you think about what Republicans are doing to voting in America?"" Fatsis: Or even more than that, Josh, what if the players, led by this coalition of African American players, the Players Alliance , decided to take a stand? I mean, the reporting so far was that no, the players weren""t going to boycott the All-Star Game because of this, but it sure as hell would have given them a terrific platform to make a statement about this. And that would have made both Atlanta and Georgia and Major League Baseball, their employers, look pretty bad. Anderson: Yeah. Also, imagine trying to do this though: Hold an All-Star Game that""s going to be tied so explicitly to the memory of Hank Aaron, right? A guy who did not want to go to Atlanta in the first place, because it wasn""t an integrated city at that point. So imagine them having to play that game against the backdrop of all of that. It just seems like … Again, I""m not saying that MLB and Rob Manfred aren""t for voting rights or that they""re not politically engaged in some of this stuff, but the timing of it is I think more salient here than their political ideology. Levin: And this hasn""t been brought up that much, but there""s also the symbolism of playing the game in a stadium in suburban Cobb County. Anderson: Yeah. Levin: It""s not actually in the city of Atlanta. And when the Braves moved there, there was all this talk about, ""Oh, Turner Field. The old stadium is in like a crime-ridden neighborhood,"" and all of this not particularly coded racial talk, and it""s moved to this place that""s not accessible by rail, because people in Cobb County—predominantly white, suburban county—voted not to extend the rail system to their community. And so symbolism there is not particularly pretty. Fatsis: No. And I would take it a step further, Josh, that this game would have been hosted by a team, at a time when the Washington football team is changing its name, the Cleveland baseball team has agreed to change its name, and here""s another team with a Native American name and racist imagery in its logos and other stuff over time, where fans very likely would have been performing a racist chant, when one of the Atlanta Braves players came to the plate during the game. And as you said, it""s a team that left the majority Black city. This looks bad on—this could have looked bad on that score too. Anderson: Yeah. I mean, man, just to sort of double-down on that point. They moved to Cobb County, where there""s a Lester Maddox bridge. And for people that are not familiar with Atlanta or Georgia, Lester Maddox was an explicitly segregationist governor who got elected in the early 1970s. Right? This is even almost within the span of our lifetimes that Georgia has this guy. That bridge still exists today. That""s on the way to the stadium there right now. So it""s like, all the imagery is working against Georgia and the Atlanta area in particular right here. It""s like, you guys are in no position to hold any judgment against anybody else. Clearly you all have your own issues that you""re dealing with. And it""s OK if people from outside of Georgia or Atlanta step in and say, ""You know what? Don""t think we want to be here. Don""t want to be involved in that. Don""t want any of that imagery involved with our showcase game."" Fatsis: Yeah. You mentioned Henry Aaron. I mean, as Howard Bryant pointed out on Twitter over the weekend, the only reason that Atlanta has a baseball team is because the city agreed to integrate seating at Fulton County Stadium as a condition for Aaron and the Milwaukee Braves to move South . Levin: I think it""s worth circling back to SB 202 itself. And there have been a bunch of useful pieces. Georgia Public Broadcasting had one, and the New York Times had one, just about the various kind of things that are in the bill and that aren""t in the bill. And it""s not as simple and explicit as being—Some of the early drafts are like, ""No voting on Sundays,"" and some things that seem kind of obvious to target this increased voting power of Black communities and people of color in Georgia that led to Democrats winning Senate seats and led to Joe Biden winning the state in 2020. But the stuff that""s actually in the bill, it""s a little bit more confusing what the effect is going to be. Or maybe some things might actually be good, but the increased voter ID requirements are going to likely disenfranchise Black voters disproportionately. And I think it""s important to look at that stuff and read that stuff. But the most important thing is to look at who""s behind this. Anderson: Mm-hmm. Levin: And back to what you were saying, Joel: This was a movement, and it""s going on across the entire country, that""s entirely based on the fact that Donald Trump lost. And if you look at the architects of this, both in the state and in the groups that are writing this model legislation, it""s all, like, these Stop the Steal people, and this guy Hans von Spakovsky who""s been pushing voter fraud lies for decades. And so it feels to me like, again, while it""s important to look at what the law actually says, this is fruit from a poisoned tree. Fatsis: Yeah. Levin: The thing that I think is complicated for Major League Baseball and other corporations is that this is basically an argument about whether we can just forget what happened with the election and with the Stop the Steal thing, and with the Capitol riot, and just kind of quote-unquote ""go back to normal"" and allow the people that did this to be reassimilated into polite society and politics, or whether these people and these ideas need to be just drummed out of everything. It is, I think, important to lay a marker down, like maybe Major League Baseball is doing. I don""t know if they""re intending to do this, but maybe practically they are, and say, ""This is not what we are as America. This is not what we should be doing."" But I do feel like there is going to be this kind of cultural and political forgetting, and these people are going to be kind of reassimilated. And so this is a really important moment right now, where the kind of early lines are being drawn about what""s going to be OK and what isn""t. Fatsis: Yeah. I think that""s an important point to make, because the marker that""s being laid down is just saying no—saying no to this nonsense. Mitch McConnell on Monday morning said ""corporations will invite serious consequences if they become a vehicle for far-left mobs to hijack our country from outside the constitutional order."" And Major League Baseball is saying this is nonsense, and it should be ignored. Levin: But this is like Republicans against Delta and Coke . I mean, can you imagine, like, Delta and Coke being considered part of the woke quote-unquote … Anderson: The resistance. Fatsis: The resistance, yeah. Levin: … the woke liberal mob? Anderson: Yeah. If you""re going to take the fight to anybody, you might as well do it against Brian Kemp, a guy who ascended politically in large part through his own efforts at attacking quote, ""voter fraud,"" and pushing through regressive voter suppression efforts. That guy is one of the—If there was a Mount Rushmore of people who were behind voter suppression efforts in this country, it would be Brian Kemp, a guy who is notorious for basically running his own gubernatorial election against Stacey Abrams. And then basically empowering Stacey Abrams a couple of years later when she""s led the Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff Senate victories a few years later. So if you""re going to take the fight to anybody, it might as well be Brian Kemp. And actually, I""m glad you brought that up, Josh. Because I had one quick thing to point out, and it""s sort of a little bit afield, but I""ve been pointing this out on Twitter for the last couple of years. And I think the last few days have pretty much validated everything I""ve ever thought about the sort of people who unironically deploy the words ""woke"" and ""cancel culture"" in these sort of debates. From Donald Trump to Brian Kemp and so on: They""ve co-opted what was once a really cool term, woke , meaning the moment that a Black person becomes aware of the impact that racism has in every facet of their life. That""s something that I grew up with, that was the term that we used for it, ironically or unironically, whatever. And now they""re using it to bolster anti-Black arguments and debate points. So to me personally, woke is the new N-word , or the new N-word lover . And there""s no way that you can look at the gradual bastardization of the word and tell me otherwise, though of course Stefan is our resident words expert here. But there""s actually a really good article in the Washington Post last week about the journey cancel culture and woke have taken in the last few years . And even Dr. Meredith Clark at the University of Virginia has been doing lots of good work and research on those terms the past few years. So all that to say, if you weren""t using woke prior to 2018, you""re suspect, and I for one can hear that dog whistle. Levin: Thank you for that, Joel. And I want to end with some uncertainty, because what happened with the NBA and the All-Star Game in North Carolina is that HB2, the trans bathroom bill, was repealed. They didn""t have the All-Star Game there in 2017, but they rescheduled it, and it was there in 2019. I don""t know what""s going to happen here. It seems unlikely that Brian Kemp and his allies in Georgia are going to be like, ""You know what? Our bad."" And so what does Major League Baseball do? They""re trying to thread this needle here. You can look at it from one perspective and say, in a sea of bad corporate choices, they""re actually trying to avoid conflict as much as they can. But this is not going to go away.

slate|"Major League Baseball will move the 2021 All-Star Game to Coors Field in Denver, Colorado, after the league announced on Friday that it was pulling the event from the Atlanta area in response to Georgia""s passage of new restrictive voting laws . The league is expected to make a formal announcement Tuesday on the new home for the July 13 game, as well as the MLB amateur draft, which was also scheduled to be hosted at the Atlanta Braves"" stadium, Truist Park. The league was remarkably decisive in its move to relocate the high-profile event out of Georgia, after a number of companies joined the chorus against the new voting law. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement that relocating the game ""was the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport,"" and that the decision was made after consulting with a host of people involved in the league, from team owners and executives to current and former players. Last week, on April 1, President Joe Biden said he would ""strongly support"" moving the All-Star Game in response to the new Georgia law. A daily email update of the stories you need to read right now. Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. Georgia""s new voter law enacts a host of new restrictions making it harder to vote while shifting administrative powers from localities to the state, all of which are expected to have a disproportionate effect on minority voters in the state. The move comes shortly after Democrats notched consecutive historic victories, first in the presidential election in November and then capturing two Senate races in January. Flooded with wild claims of voter fraud of all sorts, much of it coming straight from Donald Trump""s mouth, the overwhelmingly Republican state legislature crafted a plan to make sure the losses stopped there. Using Republican disbelief, GOP legislators rammed home a new bill in the name of ""voter integrity,"" even though repeated recounts and audits found no credible evidence of substantive fraud in Georgia""s count.

slate|"In the spring of 2012, Virginia""s General Assembly passed a bill that required women throughout the commonwealth to undergo a transvaginal ultrasound procedure before they were allowed to terminate a pregnancy. That law set off a massive national furor because, despite framing that suggested the procedure was medically indicated (it wasn""t), the law was mainly just another means of embarrassing and violating women as part of a programmatic series of unnecessary ""informed consent"" laws intended to dissuade pregnant women from abortion. Amy Poehler and Seth Meyers spoofed the state on Saturday Night Live . Jon Stewart was merciless. Very soon after, Virginia""s Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, who was at the time on the list of 2012 Republican vice presidential hopefuls, panicked and withdrew his support for the vaginal probe , and a weaker version of the bill became law instead. A daily email update of the stories you need to read right now. Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. At the time, according to a study by the Guttmacher Institute , Virginia would have been the eighth state to require ultrasounds before abortions, but only the Virginia law became a locus of nationwide fury. A harsher law was already in place in Texas (to be fair, Garry Trudeau , the Pulitzer-winning creator of Doonesbury , had gone after the Texas Legislature in a cartoon so controversial it was pulled in some newspapers). Today, according to Guttmacher , 26 states regulate the provision of ultrasound by abortion providers, and 10 states mandate that an abortion provider perform an ultrasound on every woman seeking an abortion, with eight states requiring the provider to offer the woman the opportunity to view the image. This past January, an Indiana law first signed by Gov. Mike Pence in 2016 finally went into effect , requiring that any woman seeking an abortion have an ultrasound performed at least 18 hours before the procedure, for no medical reason beyond ""more information"" and ""the sanctity of life."" Mike Pence has his own viral state law controversy. Another Indiana law he""d signed in March of 2015, a ""religious freedom"" bill that would have allowed Indiana businesses to challenge local laws prohibiting discrimination against gay customers, caused another massive national uproar. The NCAA, headquartered in Indianapolis, took the lead on protest because the law passed just before the men""s Final Four tournament. As a result of the pushback, Pence signed a softer version of the bill in April of that year. When North Carolina passed a law in 2016 barring transgender people from using the public restroom aligned with their gender identities, the state""s economy took a $400 million hit as a result of boycotts from PayPal, Paul McCartney, and others . The state repealed the restriction in 2017 . When Georgia passed the country""s at-the-time most draconian abortion law in 2019, effectively banning all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, there was another nationwide outcry. Although Georgia was the fourth state to pass such a law (pro-life groups were emboldened by the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh ), Disney""s chief executive, Bob Iger, warned that it would be ""very difficult"" for the company to continue filming in Georgia if the law went into effect. Within a day, NBCUniversal and WarnerMedia made similar threats, and various celebrities refused to film there . That Georgia heartbeat bill was permanently enjoined in 2020 , although more restrictive abortion bans have followed in other states. All of this is to say that, sure, high-level public and corporate outrage sometimes manages to soften or even kill a repressive state law. And those outcomes are surely real victories. But similar or even more cruel laws almost always wind up being passed by different state legislatures around the country—and many of them, even when they are far worse, end up largely ignored. Because so many Republican bills are copycat cut-and-paste jobs that are pushed simultaneously around the country by groups that produce fill-in-the-blank model legislation, a splashy public defeat in a single state can obscure huge successes in a dozen others. And while massive public attention focused on a single injustice in a single state is an important means of public education, it can also lead people to believe that what""s happening in that state is an outlier when in fact it""s the rule. North Carolina may not have a bathroom ban anymore, but over the past several months, a rash of states have passed laws prohibiting transgender girls from participating in school sports . And several states, including Arkansas, may be on the verge of criminalizing gender-affirming health care for trans youth . Several abortion bans that have sailed through state legislatures—including a near-total ban just passed in Arkansas—didn""t generate the nationwide controversy triggered by that Georgia law of 2019. So beyond purely tactical questions about whether massive corporate boycotts and peripatetic Hollywood attention directing people away from states in protest end up harming the Republican legislatures more than the marginalized communities who actually have to live in those economies, there is utility in asking whether all this focus on Georgia""s new vote-suppressive law takes attention away from the fact that Republican state legislators have already sponsored a tsunami of Georgia-style voting restrictions, versions of which are advancing in nearly every state. As the Brennan Center""s tracker notes , ""As of March 24, legislators have introduced 361 bills with restrictive provisions in 47 states. That""s 108 more than the 253 restrictive bills tallied as of February 19, 2021—a 43 percent increase in little more than a month."" In other words, it""s not just Georgia. Brennan has clocked 55 restrictive bills in 24 states that are already moving through state legislatures. Like Georgia""s law, most target absentee voting. A quarter seek stricter voter ID. The measures out there would make voter registration harder, expand voter roll purges, and cut back on early voting. And hyperfocusing on Georgia""s restrictive law may distract us from other chilling efforts to sweep equally awful GOP disenfranchisement strategies across new areas— including Georgia""s own new regulations enabling the partisan state takeover of county elections officials, which are currently being cut and pasted right onto Texas. Making mass disenfranchisement a Georgia-specific problem unleashes debate over a host of Georgia-specific solutions, which in turn fosters a sprawling public conversation about corporate boycotts and Major League Baseball and whether voter ID laws are inherently racist . And while it""s always a good day when Mitch McConnell is whining about big business and unimpeded free speech , the kerfuffle over who is throwing out the first pitch leads us away from a broader reckoning with a systemic, nationwide GOP effort to tamp down voting that is playing out across the entire country in ways that go beyond mere voter ID laws. Nathaniel Persily, a professor of law at Stanford Law School, where he co-directs the Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project, explains in an email why Georgia is commanding attention for what is actually a nationwide problem: Georgia has become a metaphor for the voting rights struggle, as much as it is one of the chief battlegrounds. It is far from the worst when it comes to voting accessibility. But attention has naturally drawn to it given the upset by Dems there in both the presidential and Senate races, the recent history of the president""s attempted manipulation of the vote totals, the fact that the state is controlled by Republicans (most of whom believe the 2020 election was stolen), and both the history and contemporary relevance of the fight by black voters for full voting access and equal citizenship. It represents a perfect storm of all of the forces and symbols of the contemporary voting rights struggle, and the backlash that the 2020 election and big lie have produced. It should not eclipse the larger movement afoot to retrench on voting rights, but instead Georgia should serve as a flashpoint for making the arguments that can be generalized wherever governments are making voting more difficult in response to misperceptions that the 2020 election was stolen. We are, in other words, laser-focused on Georgia this week because it provides the right metaphor. The racism of this new bill, paired with the state""s decades of history with Jim Crow vote suppression , certainly warrants particular attention, as does Georgia""s extremely recent history of activists flipping the state to win the Senate . But Georgia needs to continue to be the metaphor for the battle, and not the sole location of the battle. This voting rights battle is playing out everywhere the Big Lie is being parroted. And wasting time on petty arguments about Coca-Cola""s political speech rights or the lofty constitutional right of entry to a Major League ballpark is just part and parcel of the GOP forest/trees playbook. National political efforts to suppress the vote are happening everywhere, and it goes beyond just voter ID and Sunday voting. Georgia is Texas. Texas is New Hampshire. And New Hampshire is Florida. They are all different flavors of the same problem. That problem, believe it or not, is bigger even than Major League Baseball and Coca-Cola. And right now it""s more American than both too.

bipartisan_report|"On December 18, as then-President Donald Trump continued his frenzied fight to somehow hold onto the presidency after losing the election, the then-commander-in-chief met in the White House with four supporters of the idea that he was the rightful winner of the election and should stay in power. As Axios explains in a new report, this meeting — which included attorney Sidney Powell, former Trump official Michael Flynn, fellow former administration official Emily Newman, and former Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne on the side of the conspiracies — promptly became unhinged. Throughout the hours in which these four individuals interacted with the then-president and a rotating cast of his top officials, tensions seriously flared. In short, during the meeting, Powell and her allies attempted to get Trump onboard with their idea that he could use emergency powers to accomplish the needed steps to stay in office. Their proposal, of course, constituted a usurpation of American democracy, which would have been essentially replaced — to an even greater extent — with the dictatorial whims of Donald Trump. It is not an exaggeration to say that serious suggestions of imposing dictatorial rule in the U.S. emerged from Trump allies between his election loss and Biden""s inauguration. As Axios summarizes , Powell and those who thought like her wanted Trump to ""invoke emergency national security powers, seize voting machines and disable the primary levers of American democracy."" Axios revealed a broader version of the attempt to get Trump to invoke emergency powers than was previously publicly known. At the hours-long White House meeting on December 18, White House officials who were at some point involved included senior adviser Eric Herschmann, White House counsel Pat Cipollone, national security adviser Robert O""Brien, and others. As Axios summarizes , as the meeting got underway, Powell reiterated her delusional claim that Dominion Voting Systems — a voting machine company — ""rigged their machines to flip votes from Trump to Biden,"" adding that this effort was supposedly ""part of an international communist plot to steal the election for the Democrats."" Specifically, she implicated Venezuelan leaders — including the long dead dictator Hugo Chavez — in the imaginary election fraud scheme led by Dominion. No legitimate supporting evidence for Powell""s theories ever emerged at any point anywhere in the country or world, and no court accepted the claims. Nevertheless, Powell ""proposed declaring a national security emergency , granting  her and her cabal top-secret security clearances and using the U.S. government to seize Dominion""s voting machines,"" as Axios summarizes . At one point, Powell cited a particular county in Georgia where she could supposedly prove the existence of Dominion""s imaginary scheme… but Trump won that county. At another point, Trump himself acknowledged at least one issue with Trump""s antics, calling her repeated spelling errors in court filings ""embarrassing."" Amidst the tumult, ""people were yelling and cursing,"" Axios explains , with White House staff members frustratedly pushing back against the nonsense. At one point, Flynn apparently got into it with Herschmann, who he angrily called a ""quitter."" Herschmann angrily replied: ""Why the fuck do you keep standing up and screaming at me? If you want to come over here, come over here. If not, sit your ass down."" Meanwhile, Byrne — the former CEO — provided some of the more odd details of the meeting. Besides apparently wearing a neck gaiter, he misidentified Herschmann as Cipollone, delusionally claimed to have ""bribed Hillary Clinton $18 million on behalf of the FBI for a sting operation,"" and ""wolfed down pigs in a blanket and little meatballs on toothpicks"" once the meeting moved into the presidential residence, Axios says . This unhinged chaos covered a point when the Trump administration got stunningly close to steamrolling fundamental tenets of democracy."
bipartisan_report|"One of the voting system companies that Georgia used in its election, Dominion Voting Systems, filed a defamation lawsuit Monday. It filed against former president Donald Trump and former New York mayor and personal attorney to Trump, Rudolph (Rudy) Giuliani. The company stated that its reputation was damaged during the president""s smear campaign in preparation for an attempt to overturn the 2020 election. It was a ""viral disinformation campaign"" that was a ""clear and present danger"" to the US electoral system. Dominion attorney Thomas Clare added: ""I have boxes of evidence to support his claims."" The lawsuit addressed Giuliani""s outrageous claim that Venezuela founded Dominion for its leader Hugo Chávez, who is long dead, according to The New York Times: ""Dominion was not founded in Venezuela to fix elections for Hugo Chávez. It was founded in 2002 in John Poulos""s basement in Toronto to help blind people vote on paper ballots."" ""Giuliani""s statements were calculated to — and did in fact — provoke outrage and cause Dominion enormous damage."" Later, the suit commented that Dominion""s US subsidiary headquarters in Denver. Clare spoke in an interview: ""From a defamation law perspective, it just demonstrates the depth to which these statements sink in to people/ That people don""t just read them and tune them out. It goes to the core of their belief system, which puts them in a position to take action in the real world."" Dominion CEO John Poulos said his organization was suing Giuliani for two reasons: to correct the record about Dominion and restore trust in America""s elections. Then, Poulos referred to Giuliani""s false information spree: ""Not only have these lies damaged the good name of my company, but they also undermined trust in American democratic institutions, drowning out the remarkable work of elections officials and workers, who ensured a transparent and secure election. The thousands of hand recounts and audits that proved machines counted accurately continue to be overshadowed by disinformation."" Dominion said it planned to file additional lawsuits. The Giuliani suit stated that he and other ""prominent conservatives and news networks"" were involved in the smear campaign. Those others involved were: My-Pillow "" Mike Lindell , Lou Dobbs, Fox News, Fox Business, Newsmax, and One America News Network."" This suit linked Giuliani""s wrong-headed statements about Dominion having an impact on the January insurrection: ""Having been deceived by Giuliani and his allies into thinking that they were not criminals — but patriots ""Defending the Republic"" from Dominion and its co-conspirators — they then bragged about their involvement in the crime on social media."" Dominion claimed that Giuliani benefitted ""significantly"" from his lies: ""He reportedly demanded $20,000 per day for his legal services and cashed in by hosting a podcast where he exploited election falsehoods to market gold coins, supplements, cigars, and protection from ""cyberthieves."" Dominion attorney Clare was also open to additional litigation: ""We""re not ruling anybody out. Obviously, this lawsuit against the president""s lawyer moves one step closer to the former president and understanding what his role was and wasn""t."" Conservative website The American Thinker apologized: ""Reports about Dominion are completely false and have no basis in fact, and it was wrong for us to publish these false statements.""

bipartisan_report|"Over the weekend, the news emerged that President Donald Trump spent about an hour on the phone on Saturday with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R), who he tried to pressure into finding some way to flip the state""s certified election outcome in his favor. Trump based his demands for this election intervention on false claims that fraud plagued the election and swung the outcome away from him in the first place, ludicrously insisting that he actually won the state by some half a million votes or so. On Monday, Gabriel Sterling — the voting systems implementation manager for the state of Georgia — held a press conference where he roundly debunked the president""s claims. Sterling characterized the fraud claims as ""ridiculous."" Raffensperger""s office has spent months tamping down on lies about the electoral process — ""yet the president persists,"" Sterling noted. He commented, in part, as follows: ""We""ve seen nothing in our investigations of any of these data claims that shows there""s nearly enough ballots to change the outcome… Let""s just go to the other ridiculous claims that Dominion voting machines are somehow using fractional voting or flipping votes — again, by doing the hand tally, it shows none of that is true, not a whit. And let""s go back to the overall claims about Dominion Voting Systems in general. If you look at Wisconsin, they""re claiming: Wisconsin was stolen through Dominion voting machines. In the 14 counties in which Dominion voting machines were used in Wisconsin, the president got 59 percent of the vote… This is all easily provably false. Yet the president persists."" Watch his comments below: ""No one is changing parts or pieces out of Dominion voting machines. That's not — I don't even know what that means. That's not a real thing. That's not happening. The president mentioned it on the call"" — Gabriel Sterling pic.twitter.com/A2TZCmJVTY — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) January 4, 2021 Sterling also addressed a claim that Trump raised during his conversation with Raffensperger suggesting that individuals were covertly switching out internal parts from Dominion voting machines to help hide evidence of fraud… or something. Sterling sounded incredulous at the breadth of the president""s persistent ineptitude, saying that his part-switching theory is ""not a real thing."" Sterling""s comments aren""t the only repudiation of the president""s lies. During a Monday appearance on ABC, Raffensperger himself noted that it ""was pretty obvious very early on that we debunked every one of those theories that have been out there, but President Trump continues to believe them."" David Worley, the only Democratic member of the Georgia state Election Board, has called for a state investigation of the call, noting that it""s ""a crime to solicit election fraud, and asking the secretary to change the votes is a textbook definition of election fraud."" Since there""s no legitimate evidence for Trump""s claim that fraud swung the election away from him, changing the outcome, as Trump demanded of Raffensperger, would itself require fraud."
bipartisan_report|"Well, the Republicans, powered by Donald Trump""s never-ceasing furnace of hatred, never give up trying do they?

bipartisan_report|"Lin Wood, a far-right Georgia attorney who""s been involved in a slew of election-related lawsuits, has now suggested that the Christmas morning explosion in Nashville, Tennessee, could be connected to imaginary election fraud that he claims involved Dominion voting machines in use during the recent presidential election. In reality, authorities have identified Anthony Q. Warner as responsible for the blast, adding that he died in the apparent suicide bombing, although a motive is unclear. With no legitimate evidence whatsoever, Wood suggested that Warner — who, just to be clear, is dead — may have been ""falsely accused"" of the crime, seemingly suggesting that the explosion may have been a covertly directed blast targeting Dominion-connected data at an AT&T building. On Saturday, the day after the Nashville blast — which devastated nearby businesses and temporarily hobbled communication infrastructure in the region — Wood posted the following message on Twitter: ""Was an AT&T data center in Nashville destroyed by the bomb yesterday? Were AT&T cell or wi-fi signals which access Internet used in connection with Dominion voting machines? Asking for a friend. P.S. It is unlawful for voting machines to be connected to Internet."" Was an AT&T data center in Nashville destroyed by the bomb yesterday? Were AT&T cell or wi-fi signals which access Internet used in connection with Dominion voting machines? Asking for a friend. P.S. It is unlawful for voting machines to be connected to Internet. — Lin Wood (@LLinWood) December 26, 2020 The implication pretty clearly seems to be that Wood imagines that it""s at least possible that unidentified attackers bombed the AT&T building in Nashville in order to cover up data that documented supposed internet connections on Dominion voting machines. There""s zero legitimate supporting evidence for this nonsense. Dominion election management machines were not systematically connected to the internet, and there""s no legitimate evidence that the machines were involved in any kind of election-rigging scheme involving any other means of meddling with vote totals, like a vote-changing algorithm. Later on Saturday evening, after his above-cited post, Wood tied an attempted defense of Warner — the Nashville bomber — to his defense of murderer Kyle Rittenhouse, who Wood is representing in court proceedings after the Illinois resident shot and killed two people at a protest in Wisconsin. Wood posted as follows: ""Because my name is Lucian, I have read about Saint Lucian of Antioch. He was falsely accused of heresy. Kyle Rittenhouse lives in Antioch, Illinois. Kyle was falsely accused of murder. Anthony Quinn Warner is under investigation for Nashville bombing. He lives in Antioch, Tenn."" Because my name is Lucian, I have read about Saint Lucian of Antioch. He was falsely accused of heresy. Kyle Rittenhouse lives in Antioch, Illinois. Kyle was falsely accused of murder. Anthony Quinn Warner is under investigation for Nashville bombing. He lives in Antioch, Tenn. pic.twitter.com/aA76xMWbH0 — Lin Wood (@LLinWood) December 27, 2020 In a follow-up Sunday post, Wood questioned whether devastation on the streets of Nashville was really caused by explosives in an RV, as authorities have explained. In certain far-right circles, an unhinged theory has gained traction stating that the Nashville explosion was caused by a missile . The level of deluded, fantastical thinking is simply staggering. Nashville looks like a war zone. That RV sure packed a powerful punch. Or did it? pic.twitter.com/2KsG9ZBVeT — Lin Wood (@LLinWood) December 27, 2020 Meanwhile, on Monday, Wood also complained on Twitter after Georgia federal Judge Timothy Batten rejected a court case that he brought against Georgia electoral procedures ahead of Election Day for the state""s ongoing Senate elections. Atlanta Federal Judge Timothy C. Batten, Sr. dismissed my GA lawsuit this morning at 11:12 am after I filed 270 pages of fraud evidence yesterday at 6 pm. 20 page order.

tpm|"Former President Donald Trump called on his supporters to ""boycott baseball"" after the sport""s major league decided to move its All-Star game out of Atlanta in the wake of the state""s governor signing a new restrictive voting bill into law last week. ""Baseball is already losing tremendous numbers of fans, and now they leave Atlanta with their All-Star Game because they are afraid of the Radical Left Democrats who do not want voter I.D., which is desperately needed, to have anything to do with our elections,"" Trump said in a statement released by Save America PAC. ""Boycott baseball and all of the woke companies that are interfering with Free and Fair Elections. Are you listening Coke, Delta, and all!"" he added. The statement rebuking baseball and companies challenging the state""s overhaul of voting rights was first reported by The Hill . Trump""s comments come after the MLB announced its decision to relocate the game which was initially scheduled for July 13 at the Atlanta Braves"" Truist Park, after the state signed new restrictive elections rules into law. ""Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box,"" MLB commissioner Robert Manfred Jr. said in a statement released Friday. Trump has repeatedly put forward conspiracy theories about a stolen election and has scapegoated Georgia — falsely claiming that widespread voter fraud had cost him victory in the state in the 2020 presidential election. President Joe Biden who has been outspoken in his opposition to the legislation said he would ""strongly support"" moving this year""s All-Star Game out of Georgia following the bill""s passage. ""I think today""s professional athletes are acting incredibly responsibly,"" he said during an ESPN interview. ""I would strongly support them doing that. People look to them. They""re leaders."" The statement by MLB and its decision to relocate the game comes after a series of rebukes from major Atlanta-based corporations, including Delta Air Lines, Coca-Cola and Microsoft. Delat Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said the law ""includes provisions that will make it harder for many underrepresented voters, particularly Black voters, to exercise their constitutional right to elect their representatives."" Kemp, who had repeatedly defended the legislation, joined Republican colleagues in blaming ""cancel culture"" for the MLB""s decision in a Friday statement. ""Today, Major League Baseball caved to fear, political opportunism, and liberal lies"" Kemp said. ""Georgians — and all Americans — should fully understand what the MLB""s knee-jerk decision means: cancel culture and woke political activists are coming for every aspect of your life, sports included."""

Atlanta won the bid to host the traditional Midsummer Classic back in 2019, a huge honor in the world of baseball which would have resulted in a sprawling, multi-day event with attractions across the city and a chance to show off the relatively new Truist Park stadium complex.

It has already garnered three lawsuits , the most recent of which alleges that the law will make it harder to vote particularly for ""voters of color, new citizens, and religious communities."" The law comes on the heels of major Democratic inroads in the state, with President Joe Biden winning its electoral votes and Sens.

In a statement, the Atlanta Braves said they were ""saddened"" by the decision and had hoped to use the event as a platform to ""enhance the discussion"" on voting rights. Atlanta won the bid to host the All-Star game back in May of 2019, the third time it would have hosted but first at its new Truist Park stadium, about 10 miles outside of downtown Atlanta. The Atlanta Braves had been lobbying to host the game since 2017, when the new park first opened. ""When we built SunTrust Park and The Battery Atlanta we envisioned our complex would be the perfect setting for an All-Star Game and we are thrilled to be able to showcase the ballpark, Cobb County and the City of Atlanta to the world,"" Atlanta Braves Chairman Terry McGuirk said back when they won the nod. SunTrust Park has since been renamed. Atlanta won the bid over 10 other cities in part, Manfred said at the time, due to its stadium complex. ""Short of a World Series game occurring in this ballpark, which we hope will happen very soon, this is the largest event in the world of baseball,"" Braves president and CEO Derek Schiller said when Atlanta was chosen. In a sign of how important the event is both in the world of baseball and to the city itself, officials from Kemp to Atlanta Mayor Keisha Bottoms were all present at the official announcement. Events were planned to occur throughout the city as part of a multi-day attraction beyond the game itself. Pressure has intensified on various businesses headquartered in Georgia to denounce the new law, and some have called for boycotts of those that don""t.

Republican lawmakers in Georgia have been considering retaliating against companies who denounce the law. A similar dynamic is playing out in Texas where a pair of suppressive bills are wending their way through the legislature. American Airlines, based in Fort Worth, said that it was ""strongly opposed"" to a bill that passed the state Senate on Thursday, as well as ""others like it."" That bill in particular cracks down on Harris County, which includes Houston and is over 50 percent Black or hispanic, and loosens rules around partisan poll watchers, which critics fear will lead to increased voter intimidation. Microsoft, which employs 1,500 Texans, and the CEO of Dell Technologies, which is based in Round Rock, denounced a bill with similar provisions in the state House. Republicans there, like their Georgia counterparts, are displeased with the corporate backlash. ""Texans are fed up with corporations that don""t share our values trying to dictate public policy,"" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) in a statement."
tpm|"A pair of far-reaching elections bills that would make voting more difficult in Texas are attracting ire of the Lone Star State""s business community.

Fort Worth-based American Airlines said that it was ""strongly opposed"" to both a bill that passed in the state Senate early Thursday morning and ""others like it."" The Senate bill takes aim at several ways Harris County — home to Houston — made voting easier in 2020, while imposing a polling place formula that will shift election sites out of urban areas. It also adds new mandates for those assisting voters who need help at the polls, and gives partisan poll watchers the OK to video record those voters while they""re at their voting station if the watcher thinks the assistance is ""unlawful."" A House bill with several similar provisions is making its way through committee this week. Microsoft, which employs 1,500 Texans, called out the House election legislation for how it cracks down on election officials who encourage mail voting, and also said that the bill could criminalize ""honest mistakes"" made by volunteer poll workers. Michael Dell, the CEO of Dell Technologies, also singled out the House legislation in a tweet on Thursday, when the bill""s committee hearing was getting underway. Agree. Free, fair, equitable access to voting is the foundation of American democracy. Those rights – especially for women, communities of color – have been hard-earned.

A new elections law in Georgia is experiencing similar corporate backlash. There, companies were at first more milquetoast in their response to the legislation, perhaps because they had been working behind the scenes to strip the bill of its most extreme measures. They have since sharpened their criticism, under pressure from voting rights activists and communities of color. In Georgia, GOP lawmakers have flirted with ways to retaliate against companies for speaking out abut the bill, and similar resentment is already rising in Texas among Republicans who have shrugged off the criticisms. Texas Lt. Gov Dan Patrick (R) put out a statement claiming that just before American Airlines issued its criticism, a company lobbyist told him they had not yet read the bill. ""Texans are fed up with corporations that don""t share our values trying to dictate public policy,"" he said."

The Democratic senator spoke against calls for companies to yank their business from his state, including President Joe Biden""s endorsement of the Major League Baseball (MLB) organization potentially withdrawing its upcoming All-Star game from Atlanta. ""I absolutely oppose and reject any notion of boycotting Georgia,"" Ossoff said. ""Georgia welcomes business, investment, jobs, opportunity, and events. In fact, economic growth is driving much of the political progress we have seen here."" There""s been a steady flow of businesses, including those based in Georgia like Coca-Cola and Delta, that have been publicly condemning the anti-voting law as voting rights advocates threaten to boycott companies that remain silent . Georgia House Republicans lashed out at Delta on Thursday by voting to strip the airline giant of its jet fuel tax break after Delta CEO Ed Bastian slammed the voting bill as ""unacceptable.""

tpm|"Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan (R) on Thursday criticized fellow Republicans in his state for finding themselves in hot water upon the passage of the state""s new voting overhaul law, which he said can be attributed to the failure to refute former President Trump""s election fraud falsehoods during the 2020 presidential election cycle. In an op-ed published in USA Today on Thursday, Duncan, who refused to play along with Trump""s bogus fraud claims and decried the former president""s ""divisive"" influence on the GOP , argued that the new Georgia voting law was a direct result of the misinformation campaign led by Trump. After noting that the restrictive provisions in the law are a ""much-improved version"" of previous drafts in the Georgia legislature — citing the removal of limitations on Sunday voting and the elimination of no-excuse absentee voting — Duncan took aim at Republicans for feeding into Trump""s election fraud falsehoods. Duncan argued that if Republicans simply would have ""unequivocally remove any and all doubt in the public"" by refuting Trump""s bogus claims, then Republicans in politically safe districts would have the spine to ""resist the temptation to superficially support knee-jerk reaction legislation."" Duncan pointed to the law""s restrictive provisions such as the banning of distribution of water to voters and the removal of oversight responsibility from Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — who become a punching back of Trump""s after he refused to play along with the President""s falsehoods. Duncan accused Republican legislators of pushing the new law through for the purpose of ""appeasing the extreme right corners of their districts"" and avoiding potential primary challenges. ""Unfortunately, Republicans fell into the trap set by the left and allowed them to make the bill into something that it""s not,"" Duncan said. Duncan went on to acknowledge that Republicans have ""a huge hole to climb out of"" in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election that put Georgia in the spotlight, before urging the party to no longer feed into unfounded allegations that work to delegitimize the election process. ""As Republicans, we must change the tone we use in future elections; conservatism shouldn""t be confused as divisive or mean-spirited. We need genuine empathy so we can understand and reach more voters,"" Duncan said. ""And we need to champion conservative causes that can win broad support and restore pillars like fiscal restraint that have crumbled as the GOP has put person over party. I call this approach GOP 2.0."" Duncan concluded Republicans who supported the legislation ""may be afraid of high turnout"" as a result of running on the former president""s platform while arguing that the party needs better leadership more than election reform to win back the White House. Last month, Duncan refused to preside over a session of the state Senate debating the sweeping elections restrictions. Georgia""s No.2 Republican temporarily gave up the gavel amid vehemently opposing the bill""s effort to severely limit absentee voting."
tpm|"A new report identifies Texas, Georgia and Arizona — all states where Democrats made significant inroads in 2020 — as the biggest producers of restrictive voter legislation. The report, published by NYU""s Brennan Center for Justice , identified 49 such bills from Texas, 25 from Georgia and 23 from Arizona. In total, the number of restrictive bills has climbed to 361 bills in 47 states, over 100 more than the center""s last tally in late February. ""Bills are actively moving in the Texas and Arizona statehouses, and Georgia enacted an omnibus voter suppression bill last week,"" the report read. The Texas legislation includes measures that would loosen the rules around partisan poll watchers at voting sites, alarming critics about the possibility of increased voter intimidation, and would resurrect an attempted but ultimately botched voter purge from 2019. In Arizona, the bills beef up the amount of information needed to vote absentee, and shorten the window for voters to return their ballots. Two of them, per the report, also prohibit automatic voter registration and Election Day registration (two measures the state doesn""t even have at present) in a seeming attempt to create a conflict if HR1, the federal voting rights package, is passed. The Georgia omnibus law, signed last week, has garnered calls for boycotts, multiple lawsuits and prompted companies to disavow it after the fact. Most of the bills, the report said, impose greater restrictions on absentee voting. That trend was encouraged by the Democratic skew of absentee voting amid the pandemic, when former President Donald Trump constantly said, falsely, that mail-in voting was rife with fraud and turned his supporters off of the voting method. It""s not yet clear that those restrictions won""t end up hurting Republican voters too when COVID-19 ceases to be a factor. In light of the nationwide wave of restrictive bills, Democrats are rallying behind HR1 to expand and protect voting rights. While that package, if signed into law, would counteract some of the measures in the restrictive bills, the report said, some GOP legislatures are setting up contingency measures. ""Texas lawmakers have proposed setting up a parallel system with its own rules for state contests if the federal law is enacted,"" it read. HR1 seems to be going nowhere fast though. It would need 60 votes in the Senate to overcome the filibuster, a very remote possibility based on Republican commentary so far. Some Democrats, such as Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA), are using the logjam to frame the argument for doing away with the filibuster, juxtaposing a choice between protecting the sacred right to vote and preserving a Senate procedure that was often used by a racist legislators to block civil rights bills. Republican interest groups, particularly worried about the campaign finance measures in the package, are reportedly counting on GOP lawmakers to kill the package since they""ve had very little success in messaging against it, even with their own constituents. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has insisted that he will bring the package to the floor for a vote after the recess, and that ""everything is on the table"" when it comes to getting it passed."

""Today""s statement by Delta CEO Ed Bastian stands in stark contrast to our conversations with the company, ignores the content of the new law, and unfortunately continues to spread the same false attacks being repeated by partisan activists."" Kemp insisted on Wednesday that the Election Integrity Act ""expands voting access and protects the sanctity and security of the ballot box"" while snidely urging Bastian to compare his state""s voting laws ""with other states Delta Airlines operates in.""

""Frankly I""m getting sick and tired of these corporations that are happy to come to us to ask for fuel tax credits or subsidies to build plants and they""ll come back around and be hyper partisan,"" state Rep. Philip Singleton (R) told the network. The Delta chief executive on Wednesday said Georgia""s overhaul of its election rules was based on the farce of widespread voter fraud in the state. ""The entire rationale for this bill was based on a lie: that there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 elections,"" Bastian said. ""This is simply not true. Unfortunately, that excuse is being used in states across the nation that are attempting to pass similar legislation to restrict voting rights."" The strong rebuke from the Atlanta-based company was followed by a statement from Coca-Cola signaling its own opposition to the new law. Both statements have come as some advocacy and voting rights groups have put forward lawsuits alleging discrimination while others have called for a boycott to apply pressure to Atlanta-based corporations to use their clout and resources to push back on the new law. In an interview with WSB-TV earlier this week, Kemp chalked calls for boycotts up to ""cancel culture."" ""I knew what was coming from the other side. I knew that they were going to try to do this boycott, cancel culture and everything else,"" he said. ""And I wanted to get out in front of that and get the bill signed and let people know what was in it."""
cnbc|"Florida's Legislature passed an election bill Thursday that includes restrictions on drop boxes and voting by mail over the concerns of Democrats and voting rights activists that the restrictions would amount to voter suppression. Both the House and the Senate passed the bill Thursday after weeks of negotiations between Republicans in both bodies. The bill is poised to be signed into law by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has already blessed efforts to enact restrictions along these lines . The bill passed the Senate 23-17 and the House 77-40. The legislation would make a slew of changes to the state's election laws. While an earlier proposal would have banned the use of ballot drop boxes outright, the new legislation would allow their use as long as election officials follow new constraints — limits on who could drop off voters' ballots at drop boxes, a ban on moving drop boxes within 30 days of elections, restrictions on where drop boxes could be placed and a requirement that they would all have to be monitored by elections officials whenever they're open. The bill would also require voters to request to vote by mail more regularly, prohibit election officials from using private money to help pay for election administration, restrict third-party voter registration organizations, add new powers for partisan election observers and give DeSantis the leeway to appoint replacements to fill certain local political positions vacated by people running for higher office. Democrats say the last provision is targeted at local officials looking to run in a special election to replace Democratic U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings, whose death left an opening in the Democratic-heavy Miami area. Democratic state Sen. Audrey Gibson said the measure was an ""attempt to create a monarchy"" by giving the governor more power. Republicans softened language that would have prohibited handing out any items to voters within 150 feet of polling places, including food and water, except by elections officials. The legislation would now ban anyone from ""engaging in any activity with the intent to influence or effect of influencing a voter"" but allow election supervisors to provide ""non-partisan assistance,"" such as giving items to voters within the restricted zones. During the contentious House debate Wednesday, Democrats blasted the bill as being aimed at restricting minority voters and Democrats, who relied on mail voting mail and drop boxes in significant numbers during the presidential election. And they said it was the fruit of former President Donald Trump's unfounded claims of widespread electoral fraud, arguing that it was aimed at curbing strong Democratic vote-by-mail turnout. ""We are not here because we have a problem with our elections. We are here because the Republican former president lost his re-election in November, and, rather than admitting his defeat, he spun a web of lies, radicalized those lies, in an attempt to explain away the loss,"" Democratic state Rep. Omari Hardy said. ""This bill is the revival of Jim Crow in this state whether the sponsors admit it or not,"" Hardy said. Democrats offered many amendments to water down some of the restrictions, among them to remove the identification requirements, expand who could return someone's ballot to a drop box and allow for drop boxes to be monitored by cameras instead of staff members. All of the Democratic amendments failed. Republicans bristled at the accusations that they were cutting access, arguing that the state already provides robust avenues for voting and that the measures were meant to protect voters from potential fraud, even as they admitted that the 2020 election went smoothly in the state. ""I take some issue with the fact that we're trying to somehow restrict the vote. There are more ways to vote in Florida and a longer opportunity than just about any state in the nation,"" Republican state Rep. Ralph Massullo said. ""Fraud will be reduced as much as we can possibly do it with the work we're doing today,"" he said. The legislation is one of many measures being introduced in Republican-led legislatures across the country in the wake of Trump's lies about widespread voter fraud. Democrats in the state repeatedly compared the measure to legislation that passed into law this year in Georgia , which prompted significant pushback from outside groups that ultimately led a handful of prominent corporations to condemn the legislation or pull business from the state. But unlike those in Georgia, top Florida businesses have largely remained quiet despite urging from voting rights activists. Voting rights groups panned the bill's passage in a raft of statements shortly after the House vote. ""S.B. 90 is a blatant violation of Floridians' freedom to vote and represents a direct backlash to last year's record-breaking turnout,"" said Brad Ashwell, the director of the Florida branch of All Voting is Local. ""By erecting onerous barriers to request and return a vote-by-mail ballot, this legislature has made voting a test of stamina and resources rather than a statement of civic responsibility."""
cnbc|"The Texas House of Representatives on Friday backed a bill to bar election officials from sending voters unsolicited mail-in ballot applications, while giving party-affiliated poll watchers greater access to voting sites. The overnight vote in the Republican-controlled legislature followed the enactment of similar measures in Georgia and Florida in the wake of Democrat Joe Biden's presidential election win. Sponsors of the bills assert they are intended to prevent voter fraud while bolstering election integrity and public confidence in balloting. Democrats and civil liberties advocates counter that there is no evidence of widespread ballot tampering, and argue that such legislation disproportionately burdens or discourages voters of color, as well as the elderly and disabled. On Tuesday, dozens of companies — including American Airlines , Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Microsoft — urged legislators to reject any law restricting access to ballots. Friday's Texas vote ran along party lines, with the bill, which still requires final approval in both the House and Senate after a third reading, passing by 81 to 64. The Senate, also Republican-controlled, has already passed related legislation that imposes limits on the early casting of election ballots, and abolishes drive-through voting and round-the-clock voting, among other provisions. Republican Governor Greg Abbott has expressed support for the measures. ""This bill is about protecting voters, making sure the voter rules are clean,"" Republican Representative Briscoe Cain said during the House floor debate. ""I'm not sure what kind of problem we're trying to solve today,"" Democratic Representative Jessica Gonzalez said. Critics also say that granting partisan poll-watchers greater access to election sites is meant to intimidate Blacks and Hispanics, who tend to vote more heavily in favor of Democratic candidates than Republicans. Voting by mail, and early voting in general, surged during the 2020 election as voters sought to avoid ballot-box queues in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Republican legislators in numerous states have since pushed new voting limits in the wake of former President Donald Trump's false claims that his loss to Biden last November was the result of massive voter fraud. On Thursday, Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, signed a new law making it more difficult for voters to cast ballots by mail or to use ballot drop boxes. In March, Georgia adopted a Republican-backed law that included sweeping new restrictions, sparking backlash from major U.S. corporations and prompting Major League Baseball to move its All-Star Game from Atlanta in protest. More than three months after Biden was sworn in, Trump has continued to assert that the election was stolen. Courts have rejected those claims in more than 60 lawsuits challenging the results."
cnbc|"A rash of new voting legislation has caused an uproar among progressive activists, leading to some big businesses to take a political stance. Some corporations and executives have voiced opposition to the new bills, most notably in Georgia. Amazon, General Motors, and others released a joint statement in opposition to voting restrictions.

""Well, the corporations obviously have no idea what they're talking about because from many of their objections, it's pretty clear they haven't actually read the bill,"" Heritage Foundation senior legal fellow Hans von Spakovsky said. ""They don't seem to understand that, that ... the requirements of Georgia law are really not that much different from numerous other states across the country,"" he said. ""In fact, in some aspects, their law is less strict than places like New York and New Jersey."" The new law in Georgia requires voter ID for absentee voting, limits the use of drop boxes, and restricts giving out food and water to voters waiting in line near polls. Proponents think these measures will increase security and faith in elections. Opponents of such bills say they're targeting low-income voters who have less flexibility to vote during work hours and are less likely to have a driver's license or other forms of ID. ""Georgia, perhaps more than any other state, has benefited financially from the success of the civil rights movement,"" People For the American Way President Ben Jealous said. ""And so Governor Kemp should not find it surprising that if he wishes to hurl his state back into Jim Crow, that big business and that corporations would withdraw from their involvement in his state,"" Jealous said. Watch the video above to find out how these voting laws caused a corporate backlash."
cnbc|"Several major corporations in Georgia have criticized the state's controversial new voting restrictions, signed into law last week by GOP Gov. Brian Kemp. But some of those companies are keeping quiet on whether they will continue making donations to Kemp and other Georgia Republicans who support the law. CNBC reached out to six companies to ask whether they would continue making corporate donations to Georgia politicians who support the new law. Three responded. One of them, Coca-Cola, pointed to its decision to halt all political giving following the Jan. 6 riot on Capitol Hill. The new law creates some hurdles to voting by mail and includes greater legislative oversight over how elections are run. Companies such as Delta attacked the law for being too restrictive. Various advocacy groups have said the law explicitly affects Black voters, who played a key part in Democrats' surprising victories in two U.S. Senate elections earlier this year and the presidential vote last year. There is even talk of an idea, supported by President Joe Biden, to move this year's Major League Baseball All Star Game out of Atlanta. Read more of CNBC's politics coverage: Kemp and other Georgia Republicans have defended the law and dismissed corporate concerns about it . Delta, which is headquartered in Atlanta , came out against the law in a blistering memo Wednesday from CEO Ed Bastian. The company, through its political action committee, has a history of supporting Kemp and several of the bill's sponsors. Since 2018, the PAC has given over $25,000 to Kemp and several GOP lawmakers. A Delta spokeswoman would not say whether the company would halt its donations to Kemp and the law's other supporters. ""As it relates to DeltaPAC and our political donations, we have robust processes in place for reviewing candidates before every contribution to ensure they align with both Delta's position on priority aviation and business issues, and our values,"" Lisa Hanna, the Delta spokeswoman, said in an email. ""Previous contributions do not mean DeltaPAC will contribute to a candidate in the future."" The Delta representative also said that ""due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have not made any individual donations to Georgia State House or Senate candidates since before 2020."" Critics are calling for more accountability from corporations such as Delta. ""Today they have to match their political spending with their rhetoric,"" said Bruce Freed, the president of the nonpartisan Center for Political Accountability, which tracks corporate money in politics. ""They have passed the point of no return now, it's not just for access or cost free anymore,"" he noted, while pointing to the previous calls for boycotting of some of the Georgia-based companies. ""They are now finding that it's striking such a deep reaction among consumers and among the public, that it affects not only their reputation but their bottom line,"" Freed said in explaining how companies are now looking at the public reaction to their corporate donations. For Coca-Cola, it was a matter of sticking to a policy it instituted after the deadly pro-Trump riot at the Capitol. Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey called the Georgia law ""unacceptable"" in a Wednesday interview with CNBC. In a statement on Thursday, Quincey added that the company's ""focus is now on supporting federal legislation that protects voting access and addresses voter suppression across the country."" ""We suspended all political giving in January, and that pause continues,"" said Ann Moore, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola. Moore said the company's suspension of contributions affects state-level candidates, not just federal ones. Since 2018, Coca-Cola gave over $25,000 to the sponsors of the Georgia voting restrictions bill. That total includes over $10,000 to Kemp's campaigns for governor between 2018 and 2020. ""We haven't set any timeline but are continuing to think through how we use these resources,"" Moore said when asked whether the beverage giant had any plans to resume contributions. Home Depot, also headquartered in Atlanta, recently said in response to the Georgia voting law that it will work to ensure its workers across the country have the resources and information to vote. The company would not say, however, whether it would continue to back lawmakers who support the law. ""Our associate-funded PAC supports candidates on both sides of the aisle who champion pro-business, pro-retail positions that create jobs and economic growth,"" said Sara Gorman, a spokeswoman for Home Depot. ""As always, it will evaluate future donations against a number of factors."" Home Depot has given at least $30,000 to Kemp and the lawmakers who sponsored the bill. AT&T is based in Texas, but it gave over $70,000 to Kemp's campaign and cosponsors of the Georgia bill. A video on Twitter shows the Black Voters Matter group protesting outside AT&T headquarters Monday. AT&T CEO John Stankey told CNBC in a statement: ""We understand that election laws are complicated, not our company's expertise and ultimately the responsibility of elected officials. But, as a company, we have a responsibility to engage. For this reason, we are working together with other businesses through groups like the Business Roundtable to support efforts to enhance every person's ability to vote."" ""In this way, the right knowledge and expertise can be applied to make a difference on this fundamental and critical issue,"" Stankey added. UPS and Southern Company Gas, two Georgia-based companies that have given through their PAC either to various sponsors of the bill or to Kemp's campaign, did not respond to a request for comment. UPS previously said it believes ""that voting laws and legislation should make it easier, not harder, for Americans to exercise their right to vote."" It did not directly address the bill. After the Jan. 6 riot, UPS said it would suspend all PAC contributions for the time being. Read AT&T CEO John Stankey's full statement below: ""We believe the right to vote is sacred and we support voting laws that make it easier for more Americans to vote in free, fair and secure elections. We understand that election laws are complicated, not our company's expertise and ultimately the responsibility of elected officials. But, as a company, we have a responsibility to engage. For this reason, we are working together with other businesses through groups like the Business Roundtable to support efforts to enhance every person's ability to vote. In this way, the right knowledge and expertise can be applied to make a difference on this fundamental and critical issue. We're an active member of the BRT and fully support its statement of principles on voting laws. Easily accessible and secure voting is not only a precious right and responsibility, it's the single best way to ensure everyone's voice is heard."""
cnbc|"Religious leaders in Georgia on Tuesday will call for a boycott of Home Depot because of its silence on the state's new voting curbs that activists say make it harder for Black people and other racial minorities to vote. Other Georgia-based corporations - including Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola - have been meeting with the activists for weeks and issued statements opposing the voting restrictions. Coca-Cola also hosted a meeting of several companies on April 13 with the faith leaders, but Home Depot did not attend and has since ""ignored a series of follow-up requests, and has failed to speak publicly on the new law,"" the activists - led by AME Bishop Reginald Jackson and representing more than 1,000 chruches - said in a notice to media on Tuesday. ""Blacks and others have become wary and frustrated with spending their money (at) companies that do not support us on our right to vote and other issues,"" Jackson said last week. Republicans across the country are using former President Donald Trump's false claims of voter fraud to back state-level voting changes they say are needed to restore election integrity. Opponents of the moves say they are intended to disenfranchise citizens who tend not to vote Republican. More than 100 U.S. companies including Apple , Amazon , Ford Motor and Starbucks have declared their opposition to voting curbs that a number of states are considering implementing. Home Depot said on Tuesday it believes ""all elections should be accessible, fair and secure and support broad voter participation"" and that it would ""continue to work to ensure our associates in Georgia and across the country have the information and resources to vote."" It also said it ran its own initiatives, including registering more than 15,000 of its associates to vote."
cnbc|"While other corporate giants such as Coca-Cola and Delta have been quick to oppose Georgia's new voting law , film studios in the state have been less vocal. In the past, Hollywood has used the threat of production boycotts in the state to make clear its opinions about Georgia's politics. However, this time around, studios have been largely mum on the matter, leading many to wonder why. Some speculate the industry is hoping the federal government will intervene, while executives express their concerns behind the scenes or pull other levers such as the use of political donations. But another factor could be timing: Amid the coronavirus pandemic, studios are simply unable to make threats that could disrupt production. ""As a Georgia resident and business owner I've been here a few times with the anti-abortion bill and the LGBTQ discrimination bill,"" said Tyler Perry, who owns Tyler Perry Studios in Georgia, in a statement Tuesday. ""They all sent a shockwave through Georgia and the nation but none of them managed to succeed. I'm resting my hope in the Department of Justice taking a hard look at this unconstitutional voter suppression law that harkens to the Jim Crow era."" The new law, which was signed by Gov. Brian Kemp on March 26, includes a restriction on drop boxes, makes it a crime to provide food or water to voters lined up outside polling stations, requires mandatory proof of identity for absentee voting and creates greater legislative control over how elections are run. Opponents say these provisions will disproportionately disenfranchise people of color. On Wednesday, ViacomCBS became the first major entertainment corporation to publicly condemn the law. ""We unequivocally believe in the importance of all Americans having an equal right to vote and oppose the recent Georgia voting rights law or any effort that impedes the ability to exercise this vital constitutional right,"" the company posted on Twitter. AT&T, which owns Warner Media, also made a statement about the law. ""AT&T believes our right to vote is among the most sacrosanct we enjoy, and that free enterprise and companies like ours thrive where elections are open and secure,"" the company said in a statement. ""Consistent with that belief, we are working with other companies that are members of the Georgia Chamber and Metro-Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, as those organizations support policies that promote accessible and secure voting while also upholding election integrity and transparency."" Neither company threatened to boycott the state. Some have speculated that Hollywood's silence reflects the industry's challenges. It can't afford to boycott the state's filming locations after losing months of production to the coronavirus pandemic. Others think Hollywood executives may just be waiting for more information before making statements. After all, it took a few weeks after 2019's anti-abortion bill, known as the ""Heartbeat Law,"" was signed before most actors, producers and directors began to threaten boycotts in the state. A federal judge struck down the law last year. ""I think the entertainment industry is sitting this one out until the federal government brings the voting rights law to the floor,"" said Tom Nunan, a lecturer at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television and founder of the production company Bull's Eye Entertainment. ""It's a murky mess, and knowing the Hollywood culture as I do, I suspect leaders, especially Disney , who has the biggest footprint in Georgia due to the Marvel franchise of films and series, are waiting for the federal response,"" he said. Disney didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Sony officials also weren't immediately available. Hollywood has a lot of weight to throw around. The state gets just under $3 billion in direct spending from film and TV production, and another $6.5 billion in additional economic impact. This money goes to hotels, restaurants, gas stations, vehicle rentals and lumber purchases, all things needed for companies to make and produce their projects. Since 2008, enticing tax incentives have turned the state into ""Y'allywood,"" a production hub for film and television. Georgia has developed infrastructure for big-budget productions and is home to a tremendously skilled workforce of crew members, craftsmen and technicians. Ryan Millsap, CEO of Blackhall Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, told CNBC that production is ""booming"" in the state even with additional Covid protocols. He said there are more productions in Georgia than there has ever been and studios have actually had to turn down companies looking for studio space. While the threat of boycotts can be an effective bargaining chip, halting production would also hurt the local crews and other businesses that rely on that income. ""The threats of boycott have been pretty minimal at this time,"" said Molly Coffee, creative director of Film Impact Georgia and a film industry veteran based in the state. ""James Mangold made a statement on Twitter that he would not shoot in Georgia and that has been repeated by folks like Mark Hamill and Debra Messing. The fear is always that others will follow suit."" Russell Williams, professor of film and media arts at American University, suggested that there are other ways that Hollywood could make itself heard. ""Hollywood bears the added costs of protecting their workforce and patrons (where applicable) with fewer ways to recoup that investment due to the pandemic, so maybe there are more targeted ways to get legislators' attention,"" he said. ""Donation negation, anyone?"" Hollywood's elite opened their wallets to fund the Senate runoff races in Georgia earlier this year. Federal Election Commission filings show that celebrities including Mark Ruffalo, Jack Black, Jane Fonda, Susan Sarandon and Tracee Ellis Ross doled out money ahead of the January election."
cnbc|"Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian on Wednesday blasted a controversial GOP-backed Georgia voting law after facing backlash on social media for not coming out strongly enough against the new rules. The bill, signed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp last week, is set to require identification for absentee voting, limit ballot drop boxes and prohibit offering food or water to voters in line. President Joe Biden  called the bill ""Jim Crow in the 21st century."" ""Last week, the Georgia legislature passed a sweeping voting reform act that could make it harder for many Georgians, particularly those in our Black and Brown communities, to exercise their right to vote,"" Bastian said in a staff memo Wednesday. ""Since the bill's inception, Delta joined other major Atlanta corporations to work closely with elected officials from both parties, to try and remove some of the most egregious measures from the bill,"" Bastian wrote. ""We had some success in eliminating the most suppressive tactics that some had proposed. However, I need to make it crystal clear that the final bill is unacceptable and does not match Delta's values."" ""The entire rationale for this bill was based on a lie: that there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 elections. This is simply not true,"" Bastian said. ""Unfortunately, that excuse is being used in states across the nation that are attempting to pass similar legislation to restrict voting rights."" Bastian's comments come as a host of other executives slammed the new law and several Black CEOs urged chief executives to oppose efforts to restrict voting access. ""As the voting legislation that was put forward in Georgia, when we looked at it, we felt based on our knowledge of the political climate here, there was no chance that that bill was going to be eliminated altogether,"" Bastian told staff Tuesday in a video message, which was reviewed by CNBC. He said Delta, which is based in Atlanta, worked to push legislators to make changes to improve the bill. ""I know many of you are disappointed, frustrated and angry that we did not take a stronger public stand against specific measures in the bill,"" Bastian said. ""Unfortunately, the reality is that would have made it much harder to shape the legislation at all and we would have lost a seat at the table."" Bastian added he knew staff had to face questions from customers about the company's stance. Last week, Bastian said the Georgia voting law had ""improved considerably during the legislative process,"" prompting calls for a boycott of Delta on social media. Georgia's Kemp shot back on Wednesday. ""At no point did Delta share any opposition to expanding early voting, strengthening voter ID measures, increasing the use of secure drop boxes statewide, and making it easier for local election officials to administer elections — which is exactly what this bill does. ""The last time I flew Delta, I had to present my photo ID,"" Kemp said in a statement. ""Today's statement by Delta CEO Ed Bastian stands in stark contrast to our conversations with the company, ignores the content of the new law, and unfortunately continues to spread the same false attacks being repeated by partisan activists."" Delta declined to comment further or specify which parts of the bill it tried to change. -- CNBC's Kevin Stankiewicz contributed to this article."
cnbc|"Major League Baseball is discussing the status of its 2021 All-Star Game in Atlanta as more corporations publicly oppose a new voting law recently passed in Georgia. The league is gathering feedback from teams and executives about the matter before coming to a decision on relocating the game. Baseball's midsummer event is scheduled for July 13 at Truist Park, the Braves home field. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred told The Associated Press the league expects to have ""substantive conversations"" with MLB Players Association executive director Tony Clark about moving the game. But Manfred didn't go into detail about MLB's plan or its stance on the new law. ""I am talking to various constituencies within the game and I'm just not going beyond that in terms of what I would consider or not consider,"" Manfred said. Georgia lawmakers passed a bill that will overhaul state elections. The new law adds guidelines around mail-in ballots, voter registration and provides state officials more authority around how elections are operated. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed the changes into law on March 25. Critics of Georgia's new voting laws say it will suppress votes, especially among people of color in underserved areas. In an interview with ESPN, President Joe Biden criticized the changes, calling it ""Jim Crow on steroids."" The president added he would support moving the MLB All-Star Game. Kemp defended the law when he appeared Wednesday on CNBC's "" Closing Bell ,"" saying it gives more people the chance to vote on weekends. Kemp also said calls to move the All-Star game is ""ridiculous"" in an interview with Fox News . On Wednesday, top Wall Street executives , including Merck 's CEO Ken Frazier, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian and former American Express CEO Ken Chenault expressed displeasure around the new law. ""Corporations have to stand up. There is no middle ground,"" said Chenault, who appeared with Frazier on CNBC's "" Squawk Box ."" The executives called for more companies to publicly stand against elements of Gregoria overhauled voting laws. Should the city lose the game, it could suffer financially. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution , local taxpayers would pay $2 million for expenses to host MLB's event but would see a great return on that investment. The 2019 All-Star Game was projected to bring in $65 million for Cleveland. According to baseball-almanac , the last time Atlanta hosted the game in 2000, it generated $49 million. ""There is economic impact,"" said Bill Squires , an expert in sports facilities and event management. ""People are going to travel there for the weekend; watch the home run contest, the game on Monday. There is hotels, Uber , restaurants, airfare, rental cars -- there is economic impact, no doubt."" Also see these CNBC stories regarding Georgia's new voting measure: Though moving the game could be difficult logistically, Squires, who formerly managed Yankee Stadium, said he would be shocked if MLB doesn't already have a contingency plan, especially in a pandemic. He used the National Football League as an example. ""Knowing how sports operate, just think about the NFL with the situation with the San Francisco 49ers who couldn't play at Levi Stadium and relocated quickly to State Farm Stadium in (Arizona)"" said Squires, who is also a lecturer at Columbia University. ""The contingency plans are always in effect; they have to be. I'd be shocked if every league doesn't have a backup plan for the primary location because it's contingent on what is going on in the world."" Should MLB move its contest, it wouldn't be the first time a professional league relocated a significant event due to a controversial law. In 2016, the National Basketball Association removed its 2017 All-Star contest from North Carolina after ""House Bill 2,"" also known as the ""bathroom bill,"" restricted rights among the LGBT community. The NCAA also suspended its championship events in the state. The bill was eventually repealed and the NBA returned the event to Charlotte in 2019. ""It has stained our reputation, it has discriminated against our people, and it has caused great economic harm in many of our communities,"" North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said in 2017 after the bill was overturned. But as MLB remains quiet on its stance, it could harm baseball's image. Patrick Rishe, director of the sports business program at Washington University in St. Louis, said MLB's lack of action could alienate younger fans. ""If MLB is serious in catering to a younger audience, and that has been a major goal, their actions in this matter will say a lot,"" Rishe said. ""These younger fans, they want the brands they utilize to stand for something and they also want their teams and their leagues to stand for something."" MLB opens its 2021 regular-season on Thursday, returning to a 162-game format after playing only 60 games last season due to the pandemic."
cnbc|"Major League Baseball plans to relocate the All-Star Game to Coors Field in Denver after pulling this year's Midsummer Classic from Atlanta over objections to sweeping changes to Georgia's voting laws, according to a person familiar with the decision. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Monday night because MLB hadn't announced the move yet. The commissioner's office was expected to declare Tuesday that the Colorado Rockies will host the game. ESPN was first to report the decision. MLB pulled the July 13 game from Truist Park in Atlanta in response to Georgia voting rules that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp quickly signed into law March 25. Critics, including the CEOs of Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola, have condemned the changes as being too restrictive. The Georgia law includes new limits on voting by mail and greater legislative control over how elections are run, amid a push in Republican-led states to reduce voting options after former president Donald Trump made baseless claims of widespread fraud in last year's election. Colorado has a Democratic governor in Jared Polis and a Democratic-controlled legislature. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred made the decision to move the All-Star events and the amateur draft from Atlanta after discussions with individual players and the Players Alliance, an organization of Black players formed after the death of George Floyd last year, the commissioner said in a statement. Kemp has vowed to defend the measure, and other Republicans have criticized MLB's move. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott backed out of throwing the first pitch at the Texas Rangers' home opener Monday and said the state would not seek to host the All-Star Game or any other special MLB events. Coors Field last hosted the All-Star Game in 1998, the fourth season for the stadium and sixth for the Rockies franchise. It's uncertain what kind of seating capacity there might be due to Covid-19 restrictions. The Rockies had a seating capacity during their first homestand against the World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers of 21,363 fans, which was 42.6% of usual capacity. The seating was in pods, and standing room areas weren't available for fans to gather. Players also weren't allowed to sign autographs or toss baseballs into the stands, in accordance with MLB coronavirus protocols. Nolan Arenado might be back with the ""home"" team — the NL, not the Rockies. Arenado was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in the offseason after growing disenchanted with the front office over the team's vision. Arenado is a five-time All-Star and eight-time Gold Glove winner. Arenado remains popular at Coors Field, with fans showing up over the weekend wearing his Rockies uniform and his Cardinals version. There will be a sneak peek of Arenado back at Coors Field when the Cardinals play in the Mile High City from July 1-4. One thing's for sure: The Home Run Derby should be epic at elevation. Ken Griffey Jr. won it at Coors Field in 1998 by beating Jim Thome. The last time the All-Star Game was in Denver, the AL beat the NL 13-8, with Bartolo Colon getting the win and Ugueth Urbina taking the loss. There were 31 hits but only three for homers. Barry Bonds went yard along with Alex Rodriguez and Roberto Alomar, the Baltimore second baseman who was selected the MVP. Colorado was represented in that All-Star Game by Dante Bichette, Vinny Castilla, Larry Walker and coach Don Baylor. And who knows? Maybe Bichette's son, Bo, will make this year's All-Star Game. Bo Bichette is a shortstop for Toronto."
cnbc|"Business executives across the United States are calling out efforts to restrict voting access after Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed a law that opponents say would disproportionately disenfranchise people of color. Among the overhaul of state elections, the bill includes a restriction on drop boxes, makes it a crime to provide food or water to voters lined up outside polling stations, requires mandatory proof of identity for absentee voting and creates greater legislative control over how elections are run. The bill is one of many Republican-backed election efforts introduced across the U.S. after former President Donald Trump and other GOP members falsely claimed that last year's election defeat was due to fraud. Supporters say the law was needed to restore confidence in Georgia's elections. For Georgia, it comes after historic turnout in the state's election, particularly among Black voters and voters of color, in the November general election and the January runoff that saw two Democrats defeat incumbent Republican senators. Civil rights groups, corporate leaders and Democratic officials are denouncing the law. CNBC compiled a list of corporate responses to the bill: In a statement Wednesday to CNBC, Kemp defended the law and specifically took aim at Delta's chief executive. ""Today's statement by Delta CEO Ed Bastian stands in stark contrast to our conversations with the company, ignores the content of the new law and unfortunately continues to spread the same false attacks being repeated by partisan activists,"" the Republican governor said. ""Mr. Bastian should compare voting laws in Georgia — which include no-excuse absentee balloting, online voter registration, 17 days of early voting with an additional two optional Sundays, and automatic voter registration when obtaining a driver's license — with other states Delta Airlines operates in,"" he added. Kemp doubled down on that argument in an interview later Wednesday on CNBC's ""Closing Bell,"" saying he was ""glad to deal with"" the wave of corporate criticism . He also pointed to measures of the bill that expand ballot access, contending that in more than 130 of Georgia's 159 counties early voting hours will be lengthened thanks to the legislation. ""If executives want to have a debate about the merits and the facts of the bill, then we should do that,"" Kemp said.

fox_news|"What's actually in the bill? Among the most high-profile provisions of the controversial new Georgia election law is a change in how the state verifies the identity of voters who request and cast absentee ballots . The change eliminates signature-matching -- a process that can be subjective at times -- as the method of confirming absentee voters' identities. Instead, if voters have a driver's license number or a state ID number, they are required to use that to verify who they are. This change has been criticized by many as likely to make it more difficult for Georgians, specifically minorities who are more likely to vote Democratic, to vote by mail. ""The new election bill in Georgia is not about showing ID to vote,"" Atlantic writer Jemele Hill wrote. ""Republicans are salty the state went blue, and they resent that their power was taken away by black voters. They want a rigged game because they""re too lazy to come up with a new vision and compete for votes."" MCCONNELL WARNS OF 'SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES' FOR BUSINESSES THAT HELP 'FAR-LEFT MOBS' ""Georgia's new law imposes a new ID requirement to return an absentee ballot. There is no reason to do this other than Trump's lies,"" added Popular Information writer Judd Legum. ""Previously, Georgia law required voters to simply sign their absentee ballot applications. Now they will have to provide the number from a driver""s license or an equivalent state-issued identification,"" The New York Times wrote in an explainer about the law. ""This is virtually certain to limit access to absentee voting."" But under the new law, Georgia voters who don't have a photo ID are still provided with a menu of options to confirm their identity when requesting or casting an absentee ballot. According to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger's office, voters can also verify their identities with the last four digits of their social security number; a utility bill; a bank statement; a government check; a paycheck; or another government document with their name and address on it. Absentee ballot requests can be submitted electronically so voters can attach an image of their photo ID -- or one of the other forms of identification allowed if they don't have one. For mail ballots, voters can write their photo ID number. If they do not have that, they can write the last four digits of their social security number plus their birth date, Raffensperger's office said. And in the extraordinarily rare case a voter has neither, they can enclose a copy of a utility bill or other such document with their name and address. This virtually assures that voters will never have to pay for copying services to submit an absentee ballot request. GEORGIA VOTING LAW: READ FULL TEXT Raffensperger's office noted that Georgians needed a photo ID to register to vote before this new law and will continue to need one after it is passed. The difference is simply limited to what is required when requesting and casting absentee ballots. During an interview with The Daily Signal , Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also noted that voters without driver's licenses or state IDs can still prove who they are with different documents. ""And I think it""s going to be a big help and it""s in no way going to alienate or disallow someone from the opportunity to vote because most people have these IDs,"" Kemp said. ""If they don""t, we""ll give them one for free. And even if you don""t have that, there""s provisions in the bill where you can still get an absentee ballot by submitting other documents that are listed out in the legislation."" Raffensperger has separately defended requiring state ID for absentee ballots. ""There""s no rational argument against requiring state ID – provided for free to those who don""t have a driver""s license – for absentee ballots,"" the secretary of state said in a statement late last month. ""I implemented our first version of that last year; every absentee ballot request that came in through the state website was cross-referenced with the driver""s license database and other records."" Notably, Georgia's photo ID requirement for in-person voting, which has been in place for years, has not changed. FACT-CHECKER DINGS BIDEN, MEDIA PUNDITS FOR DISINGENUOUS 'JIM CROW' CLAIMS ABOUT GEORGIA VOTING LAW Raffensperger added: ""The left said that photo ID for in-person voting would suppress votes. It didn""t. Registration and turnout soared, hitting new records with each election cycle. Their cataclysmic predictions about the effects of this law are simply baseless. The next election will prove that, but I won""t hold my breath waiting for the left and the media to admit they were wrong."" The secretary of state's office also noted that the vast majority of voters shouldn't encounter any difficulty with the new law. That's because 99% of active voters already have a driver's license, Social Security number or another valid ID number on file with the state. ""Total nonsense being pushed by Stacey Abrams and the Democrats,"" Stephen Lawson, the deputy executive director of Kelly Loeffler's ""Greater Georgia"" group, said. ""The fact is this law expands access while strengthening the integrity of our elections—which is why Greater Georgia was proud to support it."" Republicans outside of Georgia have also harshly criticized opponents of the law for allegedly mischaracterizing it. ""More than 70 percent of Americans, including a majority of Democrats and a supermajority of independents, favor commonsense voter I.D. requirements; even so, Georgia will accept alternatives to driver""s licenses to verify absentee voters,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement Monday. ""All the facts disprove the big lie."" GEORGIA GOV KEMP HITS MLB, BIDEN AFTER ELECTION LAW PROMPTS ALL-STAR MOVE: NOTHING MORE THAN 'POLITICAL PLAY' ""You're gonna have all voters being able to have multiple ways to prove who they are. Drivers license, last four numbers of your social security number, even your utility bill or a free ID provided by the state of Georgia,"" former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said on ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday. ""Georgia's new election integrity law includes a common-sense provision to secure its absentee ballot system,"" Heritage Action president Jessica Anderson said in a statement to Fox News. ""Georgia has required photo IDs to vote in person for years, and now the same requirement applies to absentee ballots,"" she continued. ""This is a smart step to ensure it's easy to vote and hard to cheat in Georgia and restore Georgians' trust in their election system. Anyone calling for boycotts clearly has not read the facts about the law.""

Major League Baseball even moved its annual All-Star Game from Atlanta. The bill also includes a variety of other provisions, many of which are controversial. It legalizes ballot drop boxes, which would not have been allowed in future elections independent of the new law -- but places some limits on when those boxes are accessible. It also shrinks the window for absentee ballots to be requested; expands early voting; and shifts responsibility in the State Election Board from the Secretary of State to a ""nonpartisan"" appointee selected by the state legislature; among other things.

""Sen. Raphael G.

A Warnock campaign spokesperson told Fox News it approved the text of the group's email before Kemp signed the bill, while the provisions were still under consideration. The spokesperson noted the Georgia Senate passed a bill to end no-excuse absentee voting earlier in March, and the Georgia House originally proposed restricting weekend early voting. However, neither provision made it into the final bill, as the 3.14 Action statement Warnock signed appeared to claim.

fox_news|"The only thing more infuriating than Major League Baseball ""s unprecedented decision to punish Georgians over their state""s recent election law has been the national media""s dedication to lying about what the law says and does. Since the bill was signed by Gov. Brian Kemp on March 25, we have heard from the media about how the bill would supposedly outlaw providing food and water to people standing in line to vote. As Democratic strategist James Carville told ""11th Hour"" host Brian Williams (with no pushback), ""It is going to be illegal to give somebody that""s standing in line to vote. I have never heard of water being an illegal substance in the United States."" This particular lie has been spread by the president of the United States himself (again with no scrutiny from media). On March 26, President Joe Biden told media before boarding Marine One : ""It""s an atrocity. The idea — if you want any indication that it has nothing to do with fairness, nothing to do with decency — they passed a law saying you can""t provide water for people standing in line while they""re waiting to vote . You don""t need anything else to know that this is nothing but punitive design to keep people from voting. You can""t provide water for people about to vote? Give me a break."" VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: DELTA AIRLINES CEO, OTHERS PROVE THAT THE WOKE REVOLUTION IS NOT A GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT First, the part of the law in question primarily prohibits third parties from electioneering or attempting to persuade voters within 150 feet of a polling building, within said building, or within 25 feet of anyone standing in line. This was already on the books – and is common practice in many states. California, Illinois, and New York all prohibit electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place, for example. The new law in Georgia added a prohibition against giving waiting voters anything of value, including food or water within that area. Now, the law does nothing to keep third parties from supplying food or water to people outside the proscribed area. Importantly, what the media seems to be universally ignoring – or lying about – is the law expressly allows poll workers to provide water to people in line. The argument that this provision hinders anyone from voting is pure propaganda. The Washington Post has also claimed Georgia""s voting law is ""one of the most controversial because critics say it is likely to disproportionately affect Black voters."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  The basis for this claim is the law""s requirement that absentee voters must provide proof of identification. The old law only required that signatures from ballot envelopes be subjectively verified. The media propagandists claim it is harder for Black voters to get IDs, and therefore it will be harder for them to vote absentee. Now, 75 percent of Americans support identification requirements for voting, according to a recent Rasmussen Reports poll. Other surveys from McLaughlin & Associates have found more than 80 percent of voters favor voter ID laws. Wide approval of voter ID laws aside, the Georgia law simply will not keep Black voters from voting. Any assertion otherwise is a blatant lie. If a voter does not have a driver""s license, he or she can provide the number to a state-issued voting identification card (which are free in Georgia). Still, if the voter doesn""t have that, he or she can provide the last four digits of his or her Social Security number. These are only two of the ways the left-wing media and Democrats are lying about Georgia""s new election law. I go into further detail on Wednesday""s episode of my ""Newt""s World"" podcast. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The truth is: Georgia""s new election law has expanded opportunities to vote in that state. The law standardized the use of secure voting drop boxes (they were only allowed in emergencies under prior law). It expanded early voting (both in days and hours) – including mandatory weekend voting for people who work weekday hours (contrary to the lies President Biden has been repeating).

msnbc|"A day after Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) signed sweeping new voting restrictions into law, President Joe Biden condemned the attack on voting rights as ""outrageous,"" ""un-American,"" ""Jim Crow in the 21st Century,"" an ""atrocity,"" and ""a blatant attack on the Constitution and good conscience."" One element of the new Georgia law, however, stood out for the president. ""If you want any indication that it has nothing to do with fairness, nothing to do with decency -- they passed a law saying you can't provide water for people standing in line while they're waiting to vote,"" Biden told reporters . ""You don't need anything else to know that this is nothing but punitive design to keep people from voting. You can't provide water for people about to vote? Give me a break."" To be sure, the list of offensive provisions in Georgia's anti-voting law is not short. As we discussed last week, GOP policymakers have made it harder to cast ballots through drop boxes, while simultaneously making it more difficult to cast absentee ballots. But as a simple matter of human decency, the fact that Republicans made it illegal to bring water to voters forced to wait in long lines -- lines that will now be even worse as a result of the GOP's new election laws -- is awfully tough to defend. Even Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), appearing on Fox News yesterday, said this element of the new law ""doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me."" Georgia Republicans created a mess by including this provision amidst their new voting restrictions, and as a political matter, it makes a lot of sense for opponents to focus attention on this since it's the sort of provision that the public at large is likely to find offensive. But in terms of practical and electoral consequences, the Washington Post  reported over the weekend on an even more pernicious part of the new Georgia law. Up until last week, the GOP-led state legislature had very little to do with the administration of Georgia elections. The new law dramatically shuffles the deck when it comes to power. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R), who famously did the right thing in the face of unjust (and potentially illegal) pressure, has been largely stripped of his authority over state elections. The state board of elections will be led by a legislature-approved chair, who will lead a panel in which most of the members are chosen by Republican legislators -- the same legislators who sided with Donald Trump during his efforts to overturn his defeat in the state. What's more, while most election-management decisions have been made by county election boards, the new Georgia law ""fixes"" that, too: the newly revamped state board of elections will oversee county boards, complete with the authority to shift power away from local board members. A Vox explainer added, ""The state board, which now will be fully controlled by the Republican legislative majority, is unilaterally empowered to take over (among other things) the process of disqualifying ballots across the state. Given that Georgia Republicans have helped promote false allegations of voter fraud, it's easy to see why handing them so much power over local election authorities is so worrying."" Lauren Groh-Wargo, executive director of Atlanta-based Fair Fight Action, the voting rights group founded by Stacey Abrams, told reporters last week, ""It will make what we all lived through in 2020 child's play. Donald Trump won't have to strong-arm our election administrators. The most radical fringes of the Republican Party sitting in the state legislature will be able to wipe out boards of elections."" As Republicans in other states pursue similar tactics, it hardly seems ridiculous to worry about a scenario in which Americans, as early 2024, see a Democratic presidential ticket legitimately win a state, only to have that state refuse to certify the proper results. And what happens if such a scenario happens? I honestly don't know, but it's a nightmare the country would be wise to try to avoid. Yes, obviously this is more complicated than ""Republicans don't want voters waiting in long lines to get water."" But as needlessly cruel as the so-called ""line warming"" provision of Georgia's new anti-voting law is, the power grab over the administration of elections is considerably more dangerous to the future of the republic."
msnbc|"In 2013, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg predicted, with prescient clarity, what is happening right now in Georgia. Ginsburg knew then, when the Supreme Court threw out half of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act , that it would be open season for voter suppression in states previously covered under the act. And here we are facing that reality with a sweeping and unquestionably restrictive new voting law passing on a party-line vote in Georgia late last week. It came mere months after President Joe Biden won Georgia""s electoral votes and after Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock won runoff elections for the U.S. Senate in Georgia. Now two big lawsuits are being brought in Georgia , both to challenge that voting law. Both suits were filed in federal court (the first suit was filed by the New Georgia Project and other organizations, and the second suit was filed by the NAACP along with other organizations), and both allege that Georgia""s law violates the remaining portion of the Voting Rights Act, Section 2, which guards against voting laws that discriminate on account of race, color or membership in a language minority group. They also argue that the law amounts to unconstitutional discrimination. To name just a few changes we will see under Georgia""s new law: Voters have less time to apply for and request vote-by-mail ballots; anyone who wants to request a vote-by-mail ballot will face new voter ID requirements ; and the state and localities are now prohibited from sending vote-by-mail ballot applications unless they have been requested. The law also limits the number of ballot drop boxes and requires that they be inside early voting sites and only accessible during certain days and times. Another highly publicized aspect of the new law bars people from being able to give food and water to voters within 150 feet of a polling place. The law does expand early voting on weekends , but an earlier version of the law would have restricted such voting. Finally, the law also empowers state officials to take over local election boards. Democrats fear that Republican state officials will use this as an opportunity to intervene in local election boards controlled by Democrats. Biden didn""t mince any words when he called Georgia""s new election law ""sick,"" ""un-American"" and ""despicable,"" concluding that Georgia""s law amounted to ""Jim Crow in the 21st Century."" Former Democratic gubernatorial candidate and current voting rights activist Stacey Abrams referred to the laws as ""Jim Crow 2.0."" Biden""s point, and the point of many critics of Georgia""s law, is that it was passed not just to maximize Republican voting power, but also to burden and compromise African American voting power. Jim Crow laws are state and local laws that disempowered, disenfranchised and segregated African Americans. Some of the laws that led to the disenfranchisement of countless African Americans were literacy tests and poll taxes . The law that finally helped wipe out these restrictive voting laws was a federal one: the Voting Rights Act of 1965 . Yes, the same federal law the Supreme Court partially trashed in 2013. But how can Georgia""s law be justified? The answer is the way these restrictive laws are always justified: on unfounded claims of voter fraud. (Quick spoiler alert: No widespread voter fraud was found in Georgia or elsewhere .) If the only way you think you can win is to make it harder to vote, we have a problem. Since Democrats have been successful under Georgia""s current set of election laws, Republicans appear to believe that the way to ensure they can once again win political campaigns is to change the laws to be more restrictive. The legal outcome of the two cases is still to be determined. But we never should have been here in the first place, and at least two things should have prevented this law from ever passing. First, Georgia's lawmakers never should have passed this law. If politicians want to win elections, they should make the best policy arguments to the voters — not try to suppress votes to pick their voters. Second, we know that politicians will often try to maximize power, and this can trample on voters"" rights. This is the very reason so many people fought so hard for the Voting Rights Act in the first place; the act should have stood as a federal guardrail against these types of restrictions. There are two potential solutions before us. First, courts should put some teeth into what remains of the Voting Rights Act and prevent other states from following in Georgia""s footsteps. Second, Georgia""s new voting law provides all the evidence we need for new federal voting rights protections. There is currently pending legislation , passed by the House, that would do just that. It is time for the Senate to act. In the meantime, the best way to safeguard our democracy is to take part in it. Vote. Vote however you can, even if it means standing in a long line and bringing your own water."

""This is simply not true."" The Delta CEO isn't the only one making the observation. ""This is really the fallout from the 10 weeks of misinformation that flew in from former President Donald Trump,"" Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan told CNN yesterday. ""I went back over the weekend to really look at where this really started to gain momentum in the legislature, and it was when Rudy Giuliani showed up in a couple of committee rooms and spent hours spreading misinformation and sowing doubt across, you know, hours of testimony."" It was a striking acknowledgement of an important fact. Georgia Republicans initially boasted about the state's flawless system of elections in the 2020 cycle, with a voting process that worked perfectly. Then Team Trump ""spread misinformation."" Then GOP legislators put up wildly unnecessary barriers between voters and their own democracy. And then Geoff Duncan's superior, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R), signed it into law and pretended the voting restrictions had merit. It's constructive for Georgia's lieutenant governor -- by any fair metric, Geoff Duncan is a conservative Republican -- to concede to a national television audience that the process was fueled by ""10 weeks of misinformation."" Reduced to its most basic elements, governing is about identifying a problem, crafting a solution, and trying to implement a policy effectively. In Georgia, Republicans stumbled on Step 1: there was no problem to identify, there was only an avalanche of lies. As Rachel joked at the top of last night's show, national GOP leaders are lashing out at corporations criticizing Georgia's voter-suppression law as having been based on a lie, but perhaps they should reconsider now that Georgia's Republican lieutenant governor has suggested those critics are right."
msnbc|"When a new election law passed in Georgia formalizing the state""s early voting system, President Joe Biden responded with uncharacteristic vehemence. The law has come under fire from critics as a means of suppressing the vote, particularly in densely populated, mostly Black counties. There is nothing illegitimate about expressing the fear that, for example, reducing the number of drop boxes for absentee ballots and barring pop-up voting places could dissuade some voters from participating in elections. Similarly, there is nothing untoward about proponents of the law observing that Georgia""s drop box provisions , which were first used in the state in 2020 in response to the pandemic, include the egalitarian stipulation that they serve 1 of every 100,000 registered voters, or that pop-up voting places have been used to game down-ballot elections in the past. There are parts of the bill that can be rationally viewed as net positive and negative changes to Georgia's voting laws inside the bill. And we could be having an informed argument about that. But we""re not; instead, we""re arguing over a deception. Specifically, the misinformation being perpetuated about time restrictions on voting hours.

While the impact of Georgia""s new voting law on future elections is a matter of important discussion, what isn""t debatable is that these specific claims about the time restrictions for voting are outright false. And if America has learned anything, it""s that we must hold our leaders to account for the information they share with the masses.

Just months ago , we got a taste of how such a lie can radicalize and lead people to commit acts of astonishing violence . In that terrible moment, Americans of good conscience resolved to never allow such an odious fiction to undermine the public""s faith in governance again. That resolve seems to have lasted all of three and a half months, with the test coming sooner than many imagined it would: Did we really mean it when we said no more disinformation, or did that only apply to disinformation that we didn""t like? After Georgia""s voting law was passed, Glenn Kessler, editor of The Washington Post""s Fact Checker, ran a comprehensive dissection of the bill that disproves the false claims about timing. The law does not cut off voting on Election Day at 5 p.m. but merely codifies ""normal business hours"" as 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The new law allows counties the option to extend voting from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and it expands the number of mandatory days in which counties must offer early voting while giving counties the option of allowing early voting on Sundays. But that did not seem to matter. Biden had called the bill ""Jim Crow in the 21st Century."" Again, the law provides for more days of early voting options than even supposedly forward-thinking states like New York, which does not allow for the kind of no-excuse absentee voting Georgia now allows. It mandates requests for early absentee balloting two weeks prior to Election Day to ensure that the turnaround time is broad enough so that all cast ballots are counted and fewer arrive after Election Day. The law ensures transparency by requiring local election officials to post the total number of ballots cast in person, via absentee, or provisionally by 10 p.m. on the night of the election. And for populous districts with more than 2,000 voters per polling place and wait times longer than one hour, the bill mandates the hiring of more poll workers. But, for some, all these particulars were beside the point. Media figures lobbied the sports and entertainment industries to divest from the state of Georgia. Multibillion-dollar firms, including Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, condemned the law which, in the words of Delta""s CEO Ed Bastian, ""could make it harder for many Georgians, particularly those in our Black and brown communities, to exercise their right to vote."" Local giants like the actor and entertainment mogul Tyler Perry demanded the Justice Department intervene against this ""unconstitutional voter suppression law that harkens to the Jim Crow era."" His statements were reprinted without comment by local media institutions like the Atlanta Journal-Constitution . Only well after the fact did the publication append a correction, noting that ""if you""re in line by 7 p.m., you""re allowed to cast your ballot. Nothing in the new law changes those rules."" Biden might have insisted that restrictions against distributing water to prospective voters are punitive and belies the GOP""s darkest intentions, just as Republicans are free to respond that a prohibition on outside groups distributing anything within 150 feet of a polling place or 25 feet of a standing line is not out of place with other state-level laws, and polling places can make self-service water receptacles available if they so choose. That""s a debate around valid though competing interpretations of a set of mutually understood facts. We are not having that debate, and Biden is very much engaged in ensuring that we do not. In an interview with ESPN on March 31, the president was asked how he would feel if Major League Baseball moved the All-Star Game out of Atlanta to protest the state""s election law. ""I would strongly support them doing that,"" Biden said, reiterating his belief that the law is ""Jim Crow on steroids."" Georgia Democrats — from former House Speaker Stacey Abrams to Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff — objected to this, an American president demanding the economic boycott of the state they represented. But what was the MLB to do? The president of the United States said what he wanted, and baseball capitulated to his demands . When Trump, for example, would call for the petty boycotts of Goodyear Tires, Harley-Davison motorcycles, or Oreo Cookies, no one seriously believed that the threat posed to these companies"" bottom lines would be measurable. By contrast, Biden""s endorsement of a Georgia boycott has produced immediate results. The organizing force behind this self-serving mendacity has a compelling power all its own. Grounded, defensible, qualified arguments don""t have the same galvanizing force as sweeping assertions like the idea that Georgia is resurrecting racial apartheid in pursuit of Republican electoral hegemony. Just as Trump was more inclined to argue the fiction that votes were "" deleted "" than that Pennsylvania""s arcane mid-2020 election reforms might have confused or dissuaded some voters, the more defensible claim is just not as sexy as the lie. So, the lie endures. We all know how doggedly partisans will cling to a harmful mistruth to justify their persecution complex. Trump""s unfounded claims served as the predicate his voters used to dismiss any election result they disfavored. Likewise, we can""t allow Biden""s supporters to cite his words to invalidate the legitimacy of any election result in Georgia that fails to produce Democratic victories."
msnbc|"As Democrats at the national level push for new protections for voting rights, one of the principal Republican responses is that such protections are wholly unnecessary. Democrats, the GOP argument goes, are overreacting to a threat that does not exist. ""States are not engaging in trying to suppress voters whatsoever,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) insisted this week. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), another member of the Senate GOP leadership, added that the whole idea is a ""false narrative."" That was Wednesday morning. This was Thursday afternoon. The new state law is many things, but subtle is not one of them. Georgia Republicans have made it harder to cast ballots through drop boxes. And made it harder to cast absentee ballots. And made it illegal to bring water to voters forced to wait in long lines -- lines that will now be even worse as a result of the GOP's new election laws. Perhaps most importantly, as Rachel explained in detail on last night's show, the Republican-led legislature has also given itself new powers over local election boards, raising the prospect of nightmare scenarios in which legislators reject results they disapprove of. When I first started making notes about what Georgia has done, I initially wrote that Republicans did this for no reason -- Georgia's own Republican election officials have freely acknowledged that there were no irregularities with the state's 2020 elections. Legislators set out to fix a ""problem"" that did not exist. But I quickly realized that this was far too charitable an assessment. There is absolutely a reason: Democrats won some key races in Georgia, which, in the eyes of the state's GOP officials, made an attack on voting rights necessary. It couldn't be simpler: when democracy disappoints Republicans, the system itself becomes a target. GOP officials could respond to defeats by adapting to a changing landscape -- broadening their reach, moderating their platform, taking a renewed interest in responsible governance -- but they find it vastly easier and more satisfying to erect new barriers between Americans and their democracy. In the not-too-distant past, Georgia's new anti-voting law wouldn't have been permissible under the Voting Rights Act. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts helped gut that law, clearing the way for abuses like the one Brian Kemp signed into law last night in a closed-door ceremony. Voting-rights advocates nevertheless hope the judiciary may offer some relief. Marc Elias, who won 62 cases last year defending the results of the 2020 presidential election, has already announced a lawsuit challenging Georgia's new anti-voting law. One can also hope that skeptics of the Democrats' ""For the People Act"" -- Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), I'm looking in your direction -- take note of this attack on the franchise. When proponents of S. 1/H.R. 1 say they're trying to protect the core of our democracy, they're not being overdramatic or hysterical. The threat is not hypothetical or speculative. The attack on voting rights is as unambiguous as it is dangerous, but just as importantly, it's ongoing . The most serious national effort to undermine voting rights in recent memory is happening before our eyes, and it warrants a swift response."
msnbc|"In general, the dividing lines on Georgia's new voter-suppression law are unambiguous. Republicans support it; Democrats oppose it. Voting-rights advocates hate it; voting opponents love it. As political disputes go, this couldn't be clearer. There is, however, one notable exception. Donald Trump yesterday criticized Georgia Republicans yesterday for passing a "" watered-down "" anti-voting bill, and he blamed Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan (R) for not going ""further."" Later in the day, the former president took another rhetorical shot at the new Georgia law his party has scrambled to defend: In the three-paragraph statement, Trump proceeded to criticize early voting, allowing voters to return ballots through the mail, ballot drop-off boxes, and weekend voting. ""Hope the RINOs are happy,"" he added, referring to the derisive ""Republicans in Name Only"" acronym. In other words, as far as the former president is concerned, Georgia's ugly voter-suppression bill, reminiscent of Jim Crow-era tactics, is just too liberal. While mainstream critics are appalled at Georgia Republicans' wildly unnecessary crackdown on voting access, Donald Trump is appalled that the crackdown wasn't quite harsh enough. There is, of course, a larger context to this. Kemp and other state GOP officials balked when Trump demanded that they overturn legitimate election results, and as a result, the former president is determined to end their careers. Trump was likely to condemn the new anti-voting law as ""far too weak and soft,"" no matter what it included, because he doesn't want to agree with anything Georgia's Republican governor does. But NBC News' Benjy Sarlin raised an important related observation : ""When the main problem the bill is attacking is rooted in one person's lies, there's no policy 'solution' beyond the whims of that one person."" Exactly. Georgia Republican leaders boasted that the 2020 election cycle in the state was, for all intents and purposes, flawless. There was no fraud; there were no security lapses; there was no reason whatsoever to question the integrity of the results. These same GOP officials nevertheless agreed to attack voting rights in the state, not because of flaws in the system, but because Donald Trump concocted a ridiculous fantasy about winning the election he lost -- and Kemp and other Republicans were eager to be seen playing along with the lie, as if it were real. What they're discovering now is the folly of the effort. Trying to address made-up nonsense through legislation does not and cannot work, because the capricious clown responsible for the made-up nonsense will never be fully satisfied."
msnbc|"Major League Baseball recently pulled its All-Star Game from Atlanta in response to Georgia's new voter-suppression law. The exhibition will instead be played this year in Denver. And that, evidently, gave some Republicans an idea for a new talking point. At a briefing today, for example, Fox News' White House correspondent asked : The premise of the question was, of course, false, but this is clearly the line of the day in GOP circles. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) argued this morning that Colorado has ""even stricter voting regulations"" than Georgia. Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) published a related tweet , insisting the Colorado has fewer days of early voting than Georgia. Matt Whitlock, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, echoed a similar message. Conservative media ran big headlines such as , ""Colorado voting laws are similar to Georgia's despite decision to move Major League Baseball All-Star Game."" The point, of course, is unsubtle: all Georgia Republicans did was pass the same kind of voting regulations that are found in blue states like Colorado, but everyone's picking on them as part of a political vendetta, launched by rascally Democrats and meanies in Corporate America. The fact that the All-Star Game is headed to Denver, the argument goes, proves just how unfair it is to punish the poor, picked on Georgia GOP. This is, in reality, spectacularly wrong. Colorado's voting laws have effectively nothing in common with Georgia's newly revised system. In Colorado, for example, every eligible voter is automatically mailed a ballot, which Coloradans are free to return via mail or through drop boxes located throughout the state. The Rocky Mountain State has also automatic voter registration, and same-day registration for both in-person voters who choose to vote early or on Election Day. Are these election laws ""very similar"" to Georgia's? Not even a little. In Georgia, it is now illegal to send every eligible voter a ballot. Georgia Republicans have also made it harder to request mail ballots, cast mail ballots, and use drop boxes. Georgia has neither automatic voter registration nor same-day registration. Yes, Colorado does have voter ID, as does Georgia, but as a Washington Post  analysis explained, Colorado's law is ""not as stringent as many critics have suggested, or as stringent as what Georgia has and will have."" Finally, let's not forget that Georgia's new law deliberately strips power from local election officials . As a Vox explainer recently noted, ""The state election board, which now will be fully controlled by the Republican legislative majority, is unilaterally empowered to take over (among other things) the process of disqualifying ballots across the state. Given that Georgia Republicans have helped promote false allegations of voter fraud, it's easy to see why handing them so much power over local election authorities is so worrying."" Lauren Groh-Wargo, executive director of Atlanta-based Fair Fight Action, the voting rights group founded by Stacey Abrams, told reporters , ""It will make what we all lived through in 2020 child's play. Donald Trump won't have to strong-arm our election administrators. The most radical fringes of the Republican Party sitting in the state legislature will be able to wipe out boards of elections."" Is there something comparable in Colorado? Of course not. The idea that that the two states are effectively the same in imposing voting restrictions, and that Major League Baseball is guilty of hypocrisy, is demonstrably ridiculous. Either the Republicans pushing this didn't familiarize themselves with the basic details, or they know the comparison is absurd and they're hoping to fool people. Either way, this isn't a talking point to be taken seriously."
msnbc|"Voting-rights advocates, desperate to derail the voter-suppression law crafted by Georgia Republicans, hoped corporate leaders would join the fight and sway the outcome. That did not happen, and Gov. Brian Kemp (R) last week signed into law a series of ""reforms"" that will place new barriers between Georgians and their democracy. The larger political dispute, however, is not over. Yesterday, the CEOs for Delta Airlines and Coca-Cola -- both of which have corporate headquarters in Georgia -- publicly condemned the new, GOP-imposed voting restrictions for the first time. Quincey added yesterday, ""This legislation is wrong, it needs to be remedied, and we will continue to advocate for it both in private and now, even more clearly in public."" Delta's statement, meanwhile, went on to say, ""After having time to now fully understand all that is in the bill, coupled with discussions with leaders and employees in the Black community, it's evident that the bill includes provisions that will make it harder for many underrepresented voters, particularly Black voters, to exercise their constitutional right to elect their representatives. That is wrong."" Bastian added, ""The entire rationale for this bill was based on a lie: that there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 elections. This is simply not true. Unfortunately, that excuse is being used in states across the nation that are attempting to pass similar legislation to restrict voting rights."" While Microsoft is not based in Georgia, the tech giant does plan to expand its presence in Georgia , and yesterday its president, Brad Smith, also publicly criticized the state's new anti-voting law. Smith said, among other things, that it is ""clear"" to Microsoft that the new law contains provisions that ""needlessly and unfairly"" make it harder to cast ballots. For opponents of the Georgia measure, the statements were welcome, but late. This was a step in an encouraging direction, but what's less clear is whether these corporate leaders can help force a change in Georgia, and whether they can help play a constructive role in protecting voting rights elsewhere. If, for example, private-sector giants like Coca-Cola and Delta started lobbying in support of the ""For the People Act"" (H.R.1/S.1), it might very well help in preventing other states from following Georgia's lead. But just as notable is how Republicans responded yesterday. By midday, there were reports that GOP state legislators were prepared to penalize their corporate critics for taking a stand in support of voting rights. ""This is the level of anger that makes people creative,"" one Georgia Republican said yesterday afternoon. ""That should scare the s**t out of them."" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution  reported overnight that the GOP-led state House did, in fact, vote shortly before midnight to scrap a $35 million jet-fuel tax break that Delta currently enjoys. Stating the obvious, a Democratic lawmaker said the move was ""purely retaliation for the business community speaking out on a bill everyone feels is Jim Crow 2.0."" The AJC  article added that state House Speaker David Ralston (R) ""made no effort to hide"" the fact that the vote to scrap the tax break ""was payback."" Ralston was quoted saying, ""You don't feed a dog that bites your hand."" As it turns out, the bill stalled in the state Senate and won't become law, at least not anytime soon, though one GOP state senator, Jason Anavitarte, expressed disappointment that he wasn't able to vote for it. ""I wanted to send Delta a message,"" he said. That message, evidently, was that Georgia Republicans not only want to make it harder to vote, they'll also retaliate against private-sector allies who dare to criticize -- not take any meaningful action, just criticize -- voter-suppression measures. None of this is healthy in a democracy. Postscript : If some of this sounds vaguely familiar, we followed a story in 2018 in which Georgia Republicans also penalized Delta when the airline responded to a mass shooting by ending a discount for NRA members. Delta, one of Georgia's largest private employers, eventually regained the tax break."
msnbc|"The Democratic-led Senate Judiciary Committee held an important hearing this week: ""Jim Crow 2021: The Latest Assault on the Right to Vote."" With Republican officials nationwide having launched the most dramatic attack on the franchise in generations, the need for the hearing was obvious, and Democrats invited leading voices on voting rights, including Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund's Sherrilyn Ifill, to testify as witnesses. But it was former state Sen. Stacey Abrams (D-Ga.) whom Republicans seemed especially eager to tangle with. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), for example, apparently thought he could trip up Abrams with a question about her own state's new voter-suppression law. ""Tell me specifically,"" the far-right Louisianan said, ""just give me a list of the provisions that you object to."" So, she did : Apparently underwhelmed, the Louisiana Republican asked, ""What else?"" At which point, Abrams returned to her indictment of the Georgia law: Kennedy, who initiated this line of questioning, responded, ""Is that everything?"" As it turned out, no, it wasn't everything. Abrams added: Kennedy, interrupting once more, effectively cried uncle. ""I get the idea,"" the senator said. ""I get the idea."" What I'm most curious about is what he expected from this exchange. Perhaps Kennedy assumed he'd ask Abrams to list the provisions she objects to, causing her to shrug her shoulders and say, ""You know, bad stuff""? I suppose the senator assumed that Abrams was all show, indifferent to substantive details, and when pressed for specific information, she'd crumble into a post-policy mess. Kennedy hopefully knows better now."
msnbc|"When Major League Baseball announced it was pulling the 2021 All-Star Game from Georgia in response to the state""s new restrictive voting law, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell angrily slammed corporations, threatening them with ""serious consequences."" ""My warning to corporate America is to stay out of politics,"" the Kentucky Republican said Tuesday, adding, ""I""m not talking about political contributions."" The GOP told us that "" corporations are people "" — but apparently it wants these ""people"" to donate to its campaigns while shutting up when it comes to the GOP""s voter suppression laws in Georgia and beyond. Other GOP legislators like Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina are planning to introduce legislation to strip the MLB of its antitrust exemption to punish the league for taking a stand on Georgia""s recent restrictive voting law. These Republicans appear angrier with the so-called corporate woke mobs than with the actual mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan 6. (All of the above Republicans voted to acquit former President Donald Trump for his alleged role in the attack.) But these GOP officials are getting worked up over this issue for a very good reason: They know these types of boycotts have worked in the past to force Republicans to reverse course on significant measures. The most recent and likely most instructive episode came in 2016, when North Carolina""s GOP-controlled state government enacted an anti-LGBTQ law that became known nationally as the "" bathroom bill ,"" which prohibited transgender people from using bathrooms that aligned with their gender identity. The backlash was swift. Soon after its passage, the National Basketball Association announced it was moving its 2017 All-Star Game , previously scheduled to take place in North Carolina, explaining that this new law was inconsistent with the NBA""s commitment to ""diversity, inclusion, fairness and respect for others."" Then-Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, slammed the NBA""s decision , claiming that ""liberal media have for months misrepresented our laws"" and ""the selective corporate elite are imposing their political will on communities."" These words are very similar to those of current Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp when he defended his state""s new voting law against what he called ""lies from liberal activists,"" warning that ""partisan activists are coming for your business."" That defense didn""t work for McCrory in 2016. Corporations canceled large events in the state, and performers like Bruce Springsteen and Maroon 5 refused to play shows there. PayPal scrapped plans to open an operations center in Charlotte that would have added an estimated $2.66 billion to the state""s economy. In all, The Associated Press tabulated , the boycott would cost North Carolina more than $3.76 billion in lost business. With North Carolina losing revenue and sporting a PR black eye, guess what happened a year later, in March 2017? The GOP Legislature repealed the most objectionable parts of the law . And with that reversal, the NBA was back in the Tar Heel State in 2019 with its All-Star Game, bringing with it an estimated $100 million in revenue. I""m betting today""s GOP leaders are also aware of two earlier controversies in Arizona, which has got to be adding to their angst over the prospect of a widespread sports-led boycott. The first was in 2014, when the Arizona Legislature passed a bill that would have given business owners the right to refuse service to members of the LGBTQ community based on so-called religious grounds. After the bill passed, but before then-Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, announced whether she would sign it, there was again a swift backlash from sports leagues and corporations. The National Football League, which had planned to hold the Super Bowl the following year in the state, indicated that if the bill became law, it would explore other locations . A growing list of companies soon began to condemn the law and threatened to withdraw business from Arizona, including American Airlines and Apple. The criticism was so deafening that Brewer ultimately vetoed the bill, declaring it was ""broadly worded and could result in unintended and negative consequences."" Arizona had witnessed a similar backlash in 1990, when the state refused to recognize Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a holiday , which began to be observed as a federal holiday in 1986. In this case though, it was the voters of the state, not the Legislature, standing in the way by voting ""no"" on a 1990 referendum to honor MLK with a paid state holiday. (At the time, only about 3 percent of the state""s population was Black.) In response, the NFL pulled the Super Bowl scheduled for 1993 from the state. In addition, people from Stevie Wonder to U2 led a charge to boycott . After this backlash, the holiday question was again placed on the ballot in 1992, where it passed with 62 percent of the vote. This is all to say the GOP has every reason to be freaking out about a wide-scale corporate backlash. When that bottom line gets squeezed and the average person feels the economic pain, how long until Georgia voters turn on their elected GOP officials — even if today they agree with the voting law? Kemp might want to take a look at what happened to North Carolina""s McCrory, who defiantly stood his ground in 2016 against reversing that state""s anti-LGBTQ law: Come November, McCrory lost re-election to Democrat Roy Cooper. With Kemp up for re-election next year, I""m betting Kemp finds that more voters in Georgia prefer economic prosperity over suppressing the vote of people of color."
cnn|"Civil rights and voting organizations filed a suit Thursday challenging a Georgia law that affects voting in a hotly contested special election runoff in June. The lawsuit alleges that a Georgia law prohibiting voters who weren""t registered in time for the special election from voting in the runoff violates federal voting law. The case could affect the heated race between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel, who are running to replace former Republican Rep. Tom Price, who joined the Trump administration. Ossoff finished in an election this week just shy of the 50% threshold against a crowded field of Republicans, meaning he and second-place vote-getter Handel advanced to a runoff election on June 20. But the lawsuit, brought by the Lawyers"" Committee for Civil Rights Under Law on behalf of five organizations, says that Georgia law requiring voters to have registered for the first round to vote in the runoff means that voters would have had to register by March 20 to vote in June. The groups are seeking an injunction or restraining order from the court to immediately address the issue. That law violates Section 8 of the National Voter Registration Act, the lawsuit alleges, which requires states to allow voters to participate in any election for federal office as long as they register at least 30 days prior. The primary requirement for the runoff goes far past that 30-day window, the lawsuit says. Ezra Rosenberg, co-director of the Lawyer""s Committee Voting Rights Project, told reporters on a conference call that ""untold numbers"" of people could be stopped from voting in the June election. Francys Johnson, state president of the Georgia NAACP, echoed Rosenberg, saying the interpretation of the Georgia law serves to disenfranchise Georgians. ""This is an important election, it has national implications and it is of great interest to our constituency here in Georgia,"" Johnson said. ""This election is a special election, but the tactics that the secretary of state and the state of Georgia are employing are anything but special. They are typical, and that is to make voting difficult, to make voting something that all Georgians cannot participate in, and we believe that flies in the face of both the letter and the spirit of the National Voter Registration Act."" The groups say the Georgia special election shows the effects of the law are ""serious and immediate,"" requiring judicial attention. Voting rights have been a highly contested area of law for years and intensifying after the 2016 election. While President Donald Trump repeatedly made baseless claims about voter fraud, voting rights advocates have countered that laws including voter ID legislation made it more difficult for minorities to vote in the election. In 2013, the Supreme Court dealt a major blow to voting rights advocates by effectively striking down a part of the Voting Rights Act that required any changes to voting laws in certain states with a history of racial discrimination to be cleared before implementation. Since then, advocates have had to challenge laws in court while they are being implemented. The lawsuit was brought by the Georgia chapter of the NAACP, the Georgia Coalition for the Peoples"" Agenda, ProGeorgia State Table, Third Sector Development, and Asian Americans Advancing Justice – Atlanta. CNN""s Mary Kay Mallonee contributed to this report."
cnn|"(CNN) Several civil rights and voting rights groups have filed a lawsuit challenging the Georgia's new voting law, which was signed last week by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. The suit -- filed by the Georgia NAACP, Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda, League of Women Voters of Georgia, GALEO Latino Community Development Fund, Common Cause and the Lower Muskogee Creek Tribe -- claims ""SB 202 is the culmination of a concerted effort to suppress the participation of Black voters and other voters of color by the Republican State Senate, State House, and Governor."" This is the second federal lawsuit to challenge the election law that brings a raft of new voting restrictions to Georgia. The law specifically imposes voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, empowers state officials to take over local elections boards, limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to approach voters in line to give them food and water. Republicans cast the measure, dubbed The Election Integrity Act of 2021, as necessary to boost confidence in elections after the 2020 election saw former President Donald Trump make repeated, unsubstantiated claims of fraud. But the new lawsuit alleges Republican officials included specific changes that target voters of color after the record turnout and Democratic victories in the November 2020 presidential election and two Senate runoffs in January 2021. ""Unable to stem the tide of these demographic changes or change the voting patterns of voters of color, these officials have resorted to attempting to suppress the vote of Black voters and other voters of color in order to maintain the tenuous hold that the Republican Party has in Georgia,"" the lawsuit states. ""In other words, these officials are using racial discrimination as a means of achieving a partisan end. These efforts constitute intentional discrimination in violation of the Constitution and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act."" The lawsuit was filed late Sunday in the US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in Atlanta against Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and members of the State Election Board. The Democrats' go-to election attorney, Marc Elias, had filed a lawsuit Thursday on behalf of the New Georgia Project, Black Voters Matter and Rise Inc. on similar grounds. ""In large part because of the racial disparities in areas outside of voting -- such as socioeconomic status, housing, and employment opportunities -- the Voter Suppression Bill disproportionately impacts Black voters, and interacts with these vestiges of discrimination in Georgia to deny Black voters (an) equal opportunity to participate in the political process and/or elect a candidate of their choice,"" that lawsuit states. Still, the Georgia law is part of a larger effort by GOP legislators across the country -- including in the battleground states of Michigan and Arizona -- to roll back voting access in the wake of the 2020 election. Across the country, according to a February analysis by the liberal leaning Brennan Center for Justice, at least 253 bills have been introduced this year in 43 state legislatures with provisions that would restrict voting access -- more than six times the number of bills for the same time last year. This story has been updated with additional information Monday."

Follow him on Twitter @TMooresports and subscribe to his YouTube channel . The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. (CNN) Gov. Brian Kemp and a slew of Georgia Republican lawmakers sped a sweeping election bill into a Jim-Crow-like law Thursday, imposing new voting restrictions in the battleground state. The law, wrongfully dubbed The Election Integrity Act of 2021, is a poorly disguised attack against the state's minorities following President Joe Biden's victory last November.  So, sports leagues with teams in Georgia should go back to the future, emulating the time when they stopped giving cities and states huge events (Super Bowls, Final Fours and league All-Star Games) that stimulate the local economy, even before political wokeness became a thing. As for the bill's lowlights, these two measures standout:  New identification requirements for absentee voters, despite reports that more than 200,000 Georgia voters lack a driver's license or state ID number. This measure will push voters to scramble to show proof of identity through other means like a utility bill, bank statement, passport, among others. Nationally, 25% of Black Americans lack government-issued photo ID, compared to only 8% of Whites. Under the new law, giving food and water to those waiting in line to vote is now illegal. This may discourage Black Georgia voters, who historically wait in longer lines than non-minorities and often in hot weather.  As activists and leaders grapple with these actions, industries and groups including the sports world can join the fight.  Atlanta likes getting sports stuff.  Just stop giving Atlanta sports stuff.  Why Atlanta? Well, Georgia Republican lawmakers know the state's whole economy begins and ends with Atlanta, home of the state capital and the main target of these voter suppression laws since voters in predominately Black counties around Atlanta, such as Fulton and Clayton, did much to elect Georgia's first Black senator (Raphael Warnock) and first Jewish senator (Jon Ossoff).  We can start by stripping Atlanta of Major League Baseball's All-Star Game, which is set to take place in the city in July.  Major League Baseball Players Association executive director Tony Clark told the Boston Globe Friday that he ""would look forward"" to discussing moving the game from Georgia. Sound familiar? In 2017, the National Basketball Association moved its own All-Star Game from Charlotte, North Carolina, in response to the state's HB2 law. The ""bathroom bill"" required people at a government-run facility to use bathrooms and locker rooms that corresponded to the gender on their birth certificate, if the rooms in question were multiple-occupancy, and drew criticism for its discriminatory nature against the LGBTQ community. The law was repealed later that year. Not only that, but if Georgia keeps its new voting law, the National Black Justice Coalition urged the Professional Golf Association Tour to keep major tournaments out of Georgia, starting with next week's Masters Tournament. Good.  We need more of that.  In addition, Gov. Brian Kemp and Georgia Republican lawmakers should consider this: In February 2020, Miami hosted the last Super Bowl with full attendance before the Covid pandemic and, according to that area's Super Bowl Host Committee, the event had an overall $571.9 million impact on South Florida.  So, if you're, say, Atlanta, you don't want to lose a Super Bowl, not after hosting three of them and wanting a bunch more. You also don't want to lose the 16 metro Atlanta-based companies in the US Fortune 500 list . You don't want to lose conventions, trade shows, major film production companies and anything else of national or international stature, especially if the leaders of those industries say they'll refuse to enter your city or state limits while you continue to embrace racism.  According to the Atlanta Convention & Visitors Bureau, the city had nearly 47 million visitors in 2019, the last full year before the pandemic, and that translated into a $16 billion hospitality industry for the area. Are you listening, Georgia Republican leaders?  Until you and your supporters realize the 19th century was so two centuries ago, everybody, from Delta Airlines and Coca-Cola in corporate America to the headquarters of the National Football League and Major League Soccer around various sports leagues, should boycott the state of Georgia in general -- and Atlanta in particular.  Give them nothing.  Treat Atlanta and Georgia the way the NFL did Arizona during the early 1990s, when the league yanked a Super Bowl away from the state after its citizens voted not to support the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, even though it was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. Treat Georgia like the National Collegiate Athletic Association does to all of those states refusing to remove anything resembling the Confederate flag as their state flag, like they did last year in Mississippi.  Treat Atlanta and Georgia like they haven't a clue until the overwhelming majority of politicians and voters for both of those places realize Confederate leader Robert E. Lee has been dead for 151 years and policies like the ones they've enacted don't have a place in our society. This bill is more like Georgia leading the way for more than 40 other states to do what this one just did.  That is, Georgia Republican politicians gave the blueprint for their counterparts elsewhere to spit on the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by disenfranchising Black voters.  Here's how to change all of this in a hurry: Force those Republican Georgia politicians and their supporters to give you Robert E. Lee's death certificate, and then you can start giving them sports and everything else again."
cnn|"(CNN) A belated but growing corporate backlash came too late to halt Georgia's new election law but voting rights activists are now calling on US CEOs to prove their long-term commitment to the fight against Republican voter suppression. Huge employers in the Atlanta area, including Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola, on Wednesday steered into a confrontation with Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who signed the law critics described as a revival of Jim Crow racism. Their shift came after initial and widely criticized silence or ambivalence from powerful corporate leaders following the passage of the law that discriminates against Black voters and is rooted in ex-President Donald Trump's election fraud lies. The measure introduces new impediments to voting, reducing the number of drop boxes in heavily African American areas and allows the state to intervene to assert control over the conduct of elections in Democratic counties. It shortens the time available for absentee votes and introduces new registration requirements that campaigners say are designed to target Black voters. After Delta initially blandly expressed support for voting rights and largely accepted the GOP line of the law earlier this week, the airline's CEO Ed Bastian issued a memo to employees Wednesday blasting it -- saying he had now had sufficient time to understand its true effect. ""It's evident that the bill includes provisions that will make it harder for many underrepresented voters, particularly Black voters, to exercise their constitutional right to elect their representatives. That is wrong,"" Bastian said, adding that the law was based on a ""lie"" of election fraud in 2020 in Georgia. James Quincey, the CEO of Coca-Cola, told CNBC on Wednesday that his firm had ""always opposed this legislation"" and called it ""unacceptable"" after fierce pressure from civil rights organizations for a stronger stance from the soft drinks giant. Both Delta and Coca-Cola were targeted by hashtag campaigns on social media calling for boycotts. A cynic might argue that large corporations rushing to condemn the law are acting as big business usually does, to protect the reputation of their brands and to avoid alienating their customer base on a heated political issue. The time it took for the backlash to emerge explains the rush by Republican state lawmakers to speed it to the governor's desk earlier this month. But it's hard to take seriously claims by some of the world's most sophisticated companies that it took a while to find out what was in the bill. 2020 election shockwaves  The shifting attitudes in the corporate world over the legislation reflect the still reverberating shockwaves of the 2020 election and Trump's destruction of the tradition of peaceful transfers of power in his effort to overturn his election loss. Like every individual citizen, and American entity, big firms are being called upon to make a choice they would probably prefer to avoid on which side of the divide they fall -- not least since the democratic system that made them mighty is still under assault. The most recent tally by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University found that 361 bills with provisions that restrict voting have been introduced in 47 states across the country as of March 24 -- marking a 43% rise in the number of bills introduced since Brennan last released a count a little over a month ago. Whether Democrats and voting rights campaigners now have how powerful allies in the fight against a wave of voter suppression measures in multiple states will be borne out by events. The Georgia Democratic Party said the CEOs of Coca-Cola and Delta were right to criticize the law but said they should now strongly get behind two Democratic House bills in Washington sent to the Senate that would help overturn restrictions on voting in states like Georgia. The legislation would reverse many of the provisions of GOP laws and bills in Georgia, Texas, Arizona and other states by establishing national voter standards. But it faces a daunting outlook with even some Senate Democrats wary of some details. And to pass them, Democrats may have to ignite a political conflagration by abolishing the tradition of the filibuster that effectively means a 60-vote supermajority is needed to pass major legislation. ""We look forward to engaging with Georgia companies like Coca-Cola and Delta as real partners on these critical issues, which affect the civil rights of Georgians and all Americans,"" Rep. Nikema Williams, who chairs the Peach State's Democratic Party, said in a statement that kept up the pressure. Companies face change  A rush of statements by corporate leaders criticizing the Georgia law underscores how sensitive big corporations are to public opinion -- at least in the short term. They may also reflect the pressure from large Georgia-based workforces and also a judgment on the consumer of the future. Long-term demographic trends are unfavorable to White conservative political leaders facing a tide of diversity that could overwhelm their cultural populism in coming decades. Companies that get on the wrong side of the equation could dent their bottom lines in years to come. Pressure in the corporate world for more companies to speak out came amid an effort by Black business leaders led by Kenneth Chenault, the ex-CEO of American Express, and Kenneth Frazier, the CEO of Merck, to get their corporate colleagues to take stronger positions against voter suppression. ""Corporations have to stand up. There is no middle ground,"" Chenault, said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" at the start of the day in which the corporate backlash and its reprisals played out on the business channel. In a full page ad in The New York Times , Chenault and more than 70 other Black executives called on corporations to mobilize against any legislation compromising voting rights. ""The new law and others like it are both undemocratic and un-American, and they are wrong,"" the ad said. ""Make no mistake, we have seen this playbook before by those who seek to deny their fellow Americans the opportunity to make their voices heard at the ballot box. "" Kemp, Georgia's Republican governor, also appeared on CNBC and strongly pushed back at the CEOs, arguing that they had cherry picked items of the law and didn't understand it. ""If they want to have a debate about the merits and the facts of the bill, then we should do that,"" said Kemp, who stood firm against Trump's attempts to reverse President Joe Biden's win in Georgia but fell in line with the GOP law. The governor argued that critics ignore the fact that the new law now requires every county in Georgia to provide a drop box for early votes to be collected. But he did not mention new limits on the number of drop boxes allowed, and on the hours in which they can be accessed, which in effect makes it harder to vote in Democratic-leaning counties plagued by long Election Day lines. In a statement, Kemp also hit out at the criticism of the law from Bastian, the Delta CEO, claiming that there was no difference between requiring people to show official IDs like drivers' licenses to allow people to vote or to board a plane. Sports next to feel the pressure  The intervention of the corporate CEOs is a sign of success for the pressure campaign by Democrats and civil rights groups in Georgia, now a critical swing state. Biden became the first Democrat since 1992 to win the state, which was also responsible for handing his party control of a 50-50 Senate in two run-off elections in January. The voting law will ensure an incendiary race for the gubernatorial mansion in 2022 -- which could pit Kemp in a rematch against voting rights campaigner and former Georgia House Democratic Leader Stacey Abrams who played a key role in turning the state blue in November. Abrams has called the slow initial corporate response to the new voter law untenable but she said in an op-ed in USA Today on Wednesday that boycotts of big firms were not yet necessary. She called on business leaders to recognize the reality of what is happening as Republicans seek to introduce new voting laws nationwide in response to Trump's loss. Big business should also put steel in their criticism by refusing to make campaign donations to legislators who are suppressing votes, she said. ""I ask like-minded Americans to hold corporations to their professed values -- by measuring their actions and demanding they stand with us,"" Abrams wrote. The next front in the pressure campaign against Georgia's law could come in sports. Ahead of Thursday's Opening Day, the Major League Baseball Players Association has said it is open to discussing this year's All-Star Game out of Georgia. The state's politics is likely to intrude in next week's Masters tournament at Augusta National, the first golf major of the year. The National Black Justice Coalition, a leading civil rights group, has asked the PGA Tour to pull out of the tournament. The issue of race was already to the fore at this year's Masters due to the debut of Lee Elder as an honorary starter alongside Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player. Elder was the first Black player to tee off in the tournament in 1975 and his inclusion is widely seen as an attempt by the exclusive club to address past wrongs after failing to admit African American members for most of its history. Elder's honor was announced during the nationwide reckoning on race following the killing of George Floyd. The trial of the police officer accused in his death is currently taking place in Minneapolis. (AT&T, which owns CNN, is a longtime sponsor of the Masters). CNN's Chris Isidore and Fredreka Schouten contributed to this report."
cnn|"(CNN) Republicans in Georgia sped a sweeping elections bill into law Thursday, making it the first presidential battleground to impose new voting restrictions following President Joe Biden's victory in the state. The bill passed both chambers of the legislature in the span of a few hours before Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed it Thursday evening. By changing its election laws, ""Georgia will take another step toward ensuring our elections are secure, accessible, and fair,"" he said. Kemp, who is up for reelection next year, had refused to give in to former President Donald Trump's demands last year that he overturn Biden's victory -- earning Trump's public condemnation. But on Thursday, Kemp said ""alarming issues"" with the 2020 election demonstrated the need for change. He predicted critics of the new law ""will threaten, boycott, sue, demonize and team up with their friends in the national media to call me everything in the book."" The new law imposes new voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, empowers state officials to take over local elections boards, limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to approach voters in line to give them food and water. ""It's like the Christmas tree of goodies for voter suppression,"" Democratic state Sen. Jen Jordan said on the Senate floor as lawmakers prepared to vote on the nearly 100-page bill Thursday. Republicans cast the measure, dubbed The Election Integrity Act of 2021, as necessary to boost confidence in elections after the 2020 election saw Trump make repeated, unsubstantiated claims of fraud. By Thursday evening, a lawsuit challenging the new law had already been filed by a trio of voting rights groups: the New Georgia Project, the Black Voters Matter Fund and Rise Inc. ""In large part because of the racial disparities in areas outside of voting -- such as socioeconomic status, housing, and employment opportunities -- the Voter Suppression Bill disproportionately impacts Black voters, and interacts with these vestiges of discrimination in Georgia to deny Black voters (an) equal opportunity to participate in the political process and/or elect a candidate of their choice,"" the lawsuit states. The package is part of a national Republican effort that aims to restrict access to the ballot box following record turnout in the election. Biden, in his first White House press conference Thursday that he will ""do everything"" in his power to halt efforts to restrict voting rights, saying that he thinks the efforts underway in state legislatures are ""un-American."" Voting rights advocates say the state's rapid-fire action -- and plans in other Republican-controlled states to pass restrictions of their own -- underscores the need for federal legislation to set a national baseline for voting rules. Stacey Abrams, the founder of Fair Fight Action and a former Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Georgia, said the state's Republicans showed they were intent on ""reviving Georgia's dark past of racist voting laws."" ""Now, more than ever, Americans must demand federal action to protect voting rights,"" she said in a statement. The Georgia bill underwent major change in recent days -- growing from a narrow, two-page bill into a sweeping omnibus package to becoming law in a little over week. Activists and Black religious leaders in the state held rallies and threatened corporate boycotts in an unsuccessful attempt to disrupt its progress through the General Assembly ""They have rammed this through as quickly as possible,"" said Jonathan Diaz, an election lawyer with the Campaign Legal Center in Washington. ""I suspect because they know many of the provisions in this bill are not very popular."" Advocates said they were alarmed by measures that will allow any Georgian to lodge an unlimited number of challenges to voter registrations and eligibility, saying it could put a target on voters of color. And Democrats in the Georgia Senate on Thursday lambasted measures that boot the secretary of state as chairman of the state elections board and allow lawmakers to install his replacement, giving lawmakers three of five appointments. Voting rights groups argue that granting the state new powers over county elections bucks the tradition of local control and could lead to a scenario in which state officials swoop in to prevent a county from certifying its election results. Another provision shortens the runoff cycle from the current nine weeks to just four weeks During Thursday's floor debate, Republican state Rep. Barry Fleming -- a key architect of the new law -- argued it would provide ""more accountability"" to the election process in the state. Republicans scaled back some restrictive provisions from earlier iterations of the legislation, including a proposed repeal of no-excuse absentee voting. The bill is part of a larger effort by GOP-led legislatures across the country to pass restrictive voting measures in key states like Arizona, Michigan and Florida. As of February, state legislators in 43 states have introduced more than 250 bills with restrictive voting provisions, according to a tally from the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. ""This is nothing less than a concerted nationwide effort to restrict voting rights access to everyday Americans, but especially for voters of color and voters who are, quite frankly, more likely to support Democrats,"" Diaz of the Campaign Legal Center said. Officials with Heritage Action for America -- one of the national Republican groups leading efforts to clamp down on ballot access in the name of ""election integrity"" -- praised Kemp, lawmakers and the 20,000 conservative activists it said had lobbied lawmakers to pass the overhaul. Georgia's new law makes ""the state a model for the rest of the country,"" Heritage officials said. The state's changing demographics had made the longtime Republican stronghold a key political battleground last year. Last November, Biden became the first Democrat in nearly three decades to win the state. And strong voter turnout in January helped send two Democrats to the US Senate, flipping control of the chamber to their party. One of those new senators, Raphael Warnock, captured his seat in a special election and will be on the ballot again in 2022. In that election, voter will confront broad changes. Voters will have to request absentee ballots 11 days before an election, rather than the Friday before Election Day as currently allowed. And voters who seek absentee ballots have to provide a copy of their identification or the number of their Georgia driver's license or state ID to both apply for and return the ballot. The also prohibits the secretary of state's office from sending unsolicited absentee ballot applications, as it did before the 2020 primaries due to the coronavirus pandemic."
cnn|"(CNN) Several civil rights groups announced on Tuesday that they have filed a joint federal lawsuit over the Georgia election overhaul bill , the third federal lawsuit challenging the legislation since it was signed into law last week. The American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Georgia, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., Southern Poverty Law Center, and law firms WilmerHale, and Davis Wright Tremaine brought the case on behalf of the Sixth District of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Georgia Muslim Voter Project, Women Watch Afrika, Latino Community Fund Georgia, and Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. The lawsuit alleges the new law makes it harder for Georgians to vote, ""particularly voters of color, new citizens, and religious communities,"" according to an announcement of the suit released Tuesday. The suit also challenges several provisions in the new law, including the ban on mobile voting, new I.D. requirements for requesting an absentee ballot, and the ban on ""line warming"" -- which would make it a crime for volunteers to provide food and water to voters waiting in line. The law also empowers state officials to take over local elections boards and limits the use of ballot drop boxes. Republicans have cast the measure, dubbed the Election Integrity Act of 2021, as necessary to boost confidence in voting procedures in the wake of former President Donald Trump's repeated, unsubstantiated claims of fraud. The Georgia law is part of a larger effort by GOP legislators across the country -- including in the battleground states of Michigan and Arizona -- to roll back voting access in the wake of the 2020 election. Across the country, bills have been moved in at least 45 states . At least 253 bills have moved this year with provisions that would restrict voting access, according to a February analysis by the liberal leaning Brennan Center for Justice -- more than six times the number of bills for the same time last year. 'Bold and and shameful' Sherrilyn Ifill, the NAACP LDF's president and director-counsel, said Tuesday the law is ""perhaps the most bold and shameful voter suppression legislation enacted in the modern era."" ""Its purpose and target are clear: to create barriers to voting for Black voters who turned out in record numbers for the November 2020 presidential election and the January 2021 special election,"" Ifill said in a statement. ""The provisions of the new law and the manner in which it was enacted reflect a thorough disregard for the sanctity of protecting the right to vote and a headlong and determined zeal to diminish Black political power in Georgia."" The Georgia NAACP, Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda, League of Women Voters of Georgia, GALEO Latino Community Development Fund, Common Cause and the Lower Muskogee Creek Tribe filed a federal lawsuit late Sunday , claiming ""SB 202 is the culmination of a concerted effort to suppress the participation of Black voters and other voters of color by the Republican State Senate, State House, and Governor."" It also alleges Republican officials included specific changes that target voters of color after the record turnout and Democratic victories in the November 2020 presidential election and two Senate runoffs in January 2021. Marc Elias, an election attorney, filed a lawsuit last week on behalf of the New Georgia Project, Black Voters Matter and Rise Inc. on similar grounds. CNN's Dianne Gallagher, Paul LeBlanc and Chandelis Duster contributed to this report."
cnn|"(CNN) Fulton County officials on Wednesday passed a resolution that will allow Georgia's most populous county to explore legal challenges to the state's controversial voting law that was rushed into law last month. The Board of Commissioners passed the ""Stop Voter Suppression"" resolution, 4-2, on party lines. The resolution directs the Fulton County attorney to research and provide ""recommendations on, any and all legal avenues to fight implementation of Georgia's voting law, SB 202 ."" It also calls for recommendations on legal methods to maintain and expand equal access to the ballot box and the polls, within the current law. The resolution is effective immediately. Khadijah Abdur-Rahman, one of the Democratic commissioners on the board and the primary sponsor of the resolution, said the measure was necessary to ""safeguard the vote."" ""Anytime we have a bullseye on our back, we have a duty to make sure that we serve the constituents,"" Abdur-Rahman said Wednesday ahead of the vote. ""I see it as Fulton County being on the right side of history."" The measure aims to blunt the implementation of Georgia's new law in Fulton County, which includes most of the city of Atlanta. The resolution takes issue with a number of provisions in the new voting law including the state takeover of county boards of elections, a reduction in the number of drop boxes, and a ban on ""line warming"" -- preventing volunteers from providing food and water to voters waiting in line . The measure also takes issue with a provision in the new law that bans mobile voting. Abdur-Rahman previously said that Fulton County spent $350,000 on two mobile voting units that were used during the 2020 general election. She estimates 11,000 people used those two mobile voting units to cast ballots. The reduction in the number of drop boxes would particularly affect Fulton County, the commissioner said. According to the new law, Fulton County would go from having 38 drop boxes countywide to just eight. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger had issued a statement Tuesday that said, in part, ""Fulton County's Democrats are now taking aim at legislation that could actually bring Fulton's voters the relief that they have been seeking for decades."" Raffensperger pointed to long lines in the county during the primary last June and the state's early voting period for the November election as reasons for the new voting law. ""The bottom line is that Fulton County's elections leadership is responsible for running elections. It is Fulton County's elections leadership that has created long lines for their voters time and time again while other areas of the state have managed to execute successful elections,"" he said. ""Fulton County Democrats need to stop passing the blame to Republicans for failures they have sole control over, and actually do something about it. Fulton's voters need more action, not more press conferences."" The resolution also outlines support for the House-passed HR 1, or ""The For the People Act,"" making its way through Congress that would counter effects of Georgia's voting law. Two of the Republican members of the board, Commissioners Bob Ellis and Lee Morris, argued the resolution was partisan. ""There's no way for a White man in America could understand the feelings that people of color have about these really important issues,"" Morris said Wednesday ahead of the vote. ""I think all of this will be resolved in the courts quite frankly and then if the courts don't overturn Senate Bill 202, and I'm not sure that there's a great chance of them overturning the law. Then maybe the ballot box will do that some day."" ""I would love to see the day when we don't debate about voter suppression and Jim Crow laws,"" he added. This story has been updated with a statement from Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger."
cnn|"Washington, DC (CNN) A voting rights group wants Georgia legislators to change the law that allows the state to remove voters it deems are ""inactive."" Fair Fight Action, founded by former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams, has called on the state's Republican-led General Assembly to ""fix"" and ""clarify"" the state election law that determines the time frame in which voters have before being considered ""inactive"" and later removed from election rolls. The move, first reported by the Atlanta Constitution Journal , comes after a federal judged denied last month a motion from the group to restore 98,000 voters to the rolls after they were removed under the 2019 law. ""Just last year, the General Assembly gave voters a 2-year reprieve on the state's flawed 'use it or lose it' provision. But the Secretary of State ignored the will of the legislature. The legislative branch has the obligation to quickly fix House Bill 316 and clarify that their grant of extra time was intended for all Georgians,"" Fair Fight Action CEO Lauren Groh-Wargo said. The change in state law last year lengthened the period before voters become ""inactive"" from three years to five years, according to the bill. Fair Fight Action contends that the law should have covered voter registrations that had previously been declared inactive. Attorneys for the state said the law wasn't meant to be retroactively applied, according to Atlanta Constitution Journal. The group is still moving forward with a federal court case to stop ""use it or lose it"" voter purges in the state. The policy allows state officials to remove registrations from election rolls after voters fail to participate in elections for several years. The group argues that the removals are unconstitutional. ""In our view, it is a First Amendment right not to vote, and it is unconstitutional to take away a Georgian's right to vote simply because they have not expressed that right in recent elections,"" Fair Fight Action spokesman Seth Bringman previously told CNN. Georgia recently purged more than 300,000 voters from its elections rolls. Of those, an estimated 22,000 were returned after Fair Fight challenged the removals last month, according to Georgia's Secretary of State's office .

cnn|"(CNN) Georgia has a long history of attracting national sports events, but a controversial new voting law might have severe repercussions for that tradition. A leading Black civil rights group is calling on the PGA Tour to pull out of the upcoming Masters Tournament in Augusta after Republican Gov. Brian Kemp last week signed into law one of the nation's most restrictive voting rights . ""The PGA Tour and Masters Tournament have both made commitments to help diversify golf and address racial inequities in this country -- and we expect them to not only speak out against Georgia's new racist voter suppression law -- but to also take action,"" the National Black Justice Coalition said in a statement. The new law imposes new voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, empowers state officials to take over local elections boards, limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to approach voters in line to give them food and water. Voting rights groups have said the law would target the Black residents and other voters of color in the state. The National Black Justice Coalition said professional golfers should refuse to play in Georgia until the law is repealed. CNN has reached out to Augusta National and PGA Tour for comment. Major League Baseball may also be faced with a decision. This year's MLB All-Star Game is scheduled to take place this summer at Truist Park --  home of the Atlanta Braves. The executive director of the MLB Players Association says the union is open to discussing pulling the MLB All-Star game out of Georgia, according to a story published by Boston Globe on Friday. Tony Clark told the Globe that ""players are very much aware"" of the law, but ""as it relates to the All-Star Game, we have not had a conversation with the league on that issue."" CNN has reached out to MLB and the MLB Players Association for comment. Previously, another sporting league changed its plans in response to another state's legislation. The NBA moved its 2017 All-Star game out of Charlotte, North Carolina, after a controversial transgender bathroom law was passed. The law was later repealed, and Charlotte hosted the All-Star Game in 2019. The Women's National Basketball Players Association, many members of which have been champions for social justice and racial equality , has also condemned the new law in Georgia. ""SB 202 is a direct attack on the historic turnout and participation by voters during the November and January elections -- elections where Georgians voted to elect the first Black and Jewish senators from Georgia,"" the WNBPA said in a statement. The statement adds that the law comes after an election where minority voters made their voices heard in record numbers. ""This is a racist backlash designed to silence the people's voices, mirroring the over 200 bills in state legislatures across the country designed to target voters and suppress democracy,"" the statement said.

cnn|"(CNN) The children of three late civil rights movement leaders released a joint letter late Monday night to corporate leaders and lawmakers in response to the new voting law in Georgia. Bernice A. King, the daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ; Al Vivian, the son of the Rev. Cordy Tindell ""C.T."" Vivian ; and John-Miles Lewis, the son of US Rep. John Lewis , said corporate leaders failed to live up to ""their racial equity commitments"" and disrespected their fathers' tireless work. ""Rather than sowing seeds to provide democracy the greatest chance to grow today and prevail tomorrow, legislators are attempting to transport us back to the shameful period of American history when mass voter suppression for communities of color was the law of the land,"" they wrote in the letter. The three of them join numerous groups urging corporations based in the state to take a stance against the new law, which some consider one of the nation's most restrictive voting laws. The law, signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp last week, imposes new voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, empowers state officials to take over local elections boards, limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to approach voters in line to give them food and water. Voting rights groups have said the law would target Black residents and other voters of color in the state. ""The new voter suppression laws are a perversion of truth. Our democracy will be destroyed if we use blunt instruments to appease falsehoods,"" they wrote. The three children compared the response of Atlanta's ""civic and business community"" following the passing of Vivian and Lewis last year to the groups' response to the Georgia voting law. They ""became vocal champions of equity, diversity, and inclusion,"" the letter says. ""Yet, when the first test came challenging our corporations to move from words to action, to stand on behalf of disenfranchised voters, there was shocking silence,"" the letter added. ""Historically, companies' growth and prosperity in Georgia required integration of democracy and free enterprise. The lack of action is not only ethically wrong and morally reprehensible, it hurts the corporate bottom line. Racism is bad for business."" Civil rights and voting rights groups have filed at least three lawsuits in federal court challenging the voting law. The latest suit was announced Tuesday and was filed on behalf of the Sixth District of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Georgia Muslim Voter Project, Women Watch Afrika, Latino Community Fund Georgia, and Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. The lawsuit alleges the new law makes it harder for Georgians to vote, ""particularly voters of color, new citizens, and religious communities,"" the groups said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. Voters of color were able to cast their ballots after they learned of secure ballot drop boxes, took advantage of early voting and received voter education materials in their native language due to the groups' work, the lawsuit states. Another lawsuit was filed earlier this week by the Georgia NAACP, Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda, League of Women Voters of Georgia, GALEO Latino Community Development Fund, Common Cause and the Lower Muskogee Creek Tribe. That lawsuit claims ""SB 202 is the culmination of a concerted effort to suppress the participation of Black voters and other voters of color by the Republican State Senate, State House, and Governor.""

""The elections were celebrated not just for their turnout, but also for their integrity, with Georgia officials praising them as safe and secure,"" the release said.

Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp defended the law from criticism last week, saying that critics -- including President Joe Biden -- hadn't read the law.

""A boycott is not something we wanted to do, but now it is something that we must do,"" Bishop Reginald T. Jackson said in a statement read during a press conference Tuesday. ""They have simply refused to respond, not only to our request to meet, but to their other corporate partners. They believe their silence is appropriate, but not on the issue of voting rights. Blacks and people of color, like others, are also their customers and they benefit from our dollars ... we believe they should oppose any effort to suppress our votes."" Jackson, the movement's leader and head of the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church""s sixth district that includes over 500 AME churches in Georgia, could not attend the event outside a Home Depot in Decatur. But according to his statement, the coalition could add more companies to the boycott call, singling out Chick-fil-A and Arby's, which the coalition plans to contact this week. Jackson was adamant the boycott was led by faith leaders, directly disputing the Republican-espoused idea that President Joe Biden and Fair Fight Action founder Stacey Abrams are behind it. The boycott call came on the same day as the Senate Judiciary Committee took testimony from Abrams and others at a hearing focused, in part, on the nearly 100-page bill Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed into law in late March, overhauling the state's election processes. Since Kemp signed that bill, voting rights activists' pressure campaign to get corporations to publicly oppose restrictive legislation has only ramped up. The MLB decided to move its 2021 All-Star Game and draft out of Atlanta to protest Georgia's new law, a move that will result in an estimated economic impact loss of $100 million, according to Cobb County Travel & Tourism. Faith leaders have backed away from previous calls to boycott Georgia-based companies that didn't speak out against the bill, SB 202, before it was signed into law. Jackson at one point called for boycotts of Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, but has since relented. In his statement Tuesday, Jackson commended those corporations for changing their stances and said the coalition was ""glad to have them as partners in the struggle for a just and enduring democracy."" Rev. Lee May, the lead pastor of Transforming Faith Church, said the coalition is ""fluid in this boycott"" but has four specifics requests of Home Depot: To speak out publicly and specifically against SB 202; to speak out against any other restrictive voting provisions under consideration in other states ; to support federal legislation that expands voter access and ""also restricts the ability to suppress the vote;"" and to support any efforts, including investing in litigation, to stop SB 202 and other bills like it. ""Home Depot, we're calling on you. I'm speaking to you right now. ... We're ready to have a conversation with you. You haven't been ready up to now, but our arms are wide open. We are people of faith. People of grace, and we're ready to have this conversation, but we're very clear those four things that we want to see accomplished,"" May said. The Rev. Timothy McDonald III, senior pastor of the First Iconium Baptist Church, warned this was just the beginning. ""It's up to you whether or not, Home Depot, this boycott escalates to phase two, phase three, phase four,"" McDonald said. ""We're not on your property -- today. We're not blocking your driveways -- today. We're not inside your store protesting -- today. This is just phase one."" A Home Depot spokesperson responded to an inquiry from ABC News about the call for a boycott. ""We""ve decided that the most appropriate approach for us to take is to continue to underscore our statement that all elections should be accessible, fair and secure and support broad voter participation, and to continue to work to ensure our associates in Georgia and across the country have the information and resources to vote,"" the spokesperson said. The faith leaders blamed Kemp for the boycott and preempted a claim that it will hurt Georgians, saying it's not a ""job-killing boycott."" But the governor responded swiftly, blasting the boycott and saying he stands with Home Depot and its employees. ""They did not ask to be in this political fight. It's unfair to them and their families, and their livelihoods to be targeted,"" Kemp said. ""Instead of boycotting people in great companies like Home Depot, we should be supporting them, and I know that's what I'm going to do."" Home Depot has 90 facilities, 15 distribution centers and accounts for 30,000 jobs in Georgia, according to Kemp."
abc|"President Joe Biden on Friday called a sweeping new Georgia law restricting voting access, passed by the state's Republican-led legislature, an ""atrocity,"" speaking to reporters as left the White House for Delaware. He spoke shortly after issuing a statement on what he called the ""attack on the right to vote in Georgia,"" a state he won in November amid debunked claims of fraud. ""Instead of celebrating the rights of all Georgians to vote or winning campaigns on the merits of their ideas, Republicans in the state instead rushed through an un-American law to deny people the right to vote. This law, like so many others being pursued by Republicans in statehouses across the country is a blatant attack on the Constitution and good conscience,"" Biden said in the statement. He later said the Justice Department was looking into the matter. On Thursday afternoon, Georgia Republicans voted to pass and sign into law a 90-page bill that severely limits voting rights in a previously Republican-dominated state that, besides Biden, also elected two Democratic senators in the 2020 election. Republicans said they were ensuring election integrity. When the bill was sent quickly to GOP Gov. Brian Kemp for his signature, a Democratic state representative from Atlanta, Park Cannon, went to his office, knocked on the governor's closed office door, demanding to be let in. In a scene caught on video, she was arrested by Georgia state troopers, taken from the building, and charged with a felony for obstruction of law enforcement and preventing or disrupting General Assembly sessions, according to the Georgia State Patrol. ""I think anyone who saw that video would have been deeply concerned by the actions that were taken by law enforcement to arrest her when she simply, by the video that was provided, seemed to be knocking on the door to see if she could watch a bill being signed into law,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at her Friday briefing. Biden, in his statement, said he would ""take his case to the American people."" ""This is Jim Crow in the 21st Century. It must end. We have a moral and Constitutional obligation to act. I once again urge Congress to pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to make it easier for all eligible Americans access the ballot box and prevent attacks on the sacred right to vote,"" he said in the statement. Earlier Friday, White House communications director Kate Bedingfield told CNN Biden will work to ensure the Senate passes the voting rights bill that could negate Georgia's new law, without being specific whether he would support doing away with the Senate filibuster rule in order to get it done. ""You saw him speak to this yesterday, incredibly forcefully, you know, he said what we see going on here is sick, it's un-American,"" she said. ""So, yes, and he is going to work to push forward and ensure that we are signing this legislation into law."" However, with a very narrow Democratic majority in the Senate, passing the legislation might mean doing away with the filibuster , something Biden has maintained he doesn't want to do, but hinted Thursday that is might be an option to achieving policy goals. ""In terms of the filibuster, his great hope, his preference is we can work together on issues that matter tremendously to the American people,"" Bedingfield said. ""If Republicans refuse to do that, then as he said yesterday, he'll look at different options, but his hope is we can continue to work together."" ""What I'm worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It's sick. It's sick. Deciding in some states that you cannot bring water to people standing in line waiting to vote? Deciding that you're going to end voting at 5:00 when working people are just getting off work? Deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances?"" Biden said at his Thursday news conference. ""It's all designed."" He kept up his criticism in Friday's statement. ""Among the outrageous parts of this new state law, it ends voting hours early so working people can""t cast their vote after their shift is over. It adds rigid restrictions on casting absentee ballots that will effectively deny the right to vote to countless voters. And it makes it a crime to provide water to voters while they wait in line – lines Republican officials themselves have created by reducing the number of polling sites across the state, disproportionately in Black neighborhoods,"" he said. Asked Friday how the voting rights issue affected his thinking on the Senate filibuster, Biden seemed to tamp down expectations. ""You know, you have to have 50 votes. 51 votes. You have to win to be able to move the filibuster, on any change in the filibuster. And right now, that doesn""t exist,"" he told reporters. ""That doesn""t exist. So, you know, look, I -- The only thing I""ve been relatively good at in my long career in the Senate is figuring out when to move and when not to move. You got to have the votes."" Georgia Gov. Kemp shot back at Biden Friday. ""There is nothing ""Jim Crow"" about requiring a photo or state-issued ID to vote by absentee ballot – every Georgia voter must already do so when voting in-person. President Biden, the left, and the national media are determined to destroy the sanctity and security of the ballot box,"" Kemp said in a statement.

abc|"Partisan divides were on full display Tuesday morning as the Senate Judiciary Committee discussed a wave of restrictive voting legislation introduced in statehouses across the country and federal legislation that would standardize voting laws. Republicans across 47 states have introduced 361 voting-related bills in their legislative sessions this year with the premise of restoring confidence in elections -- setting off outrage from Democrats and advocacy groups who are dubbing the trend ""The New Jim Crow."" The title of Tuesday's hearing was ""Jim Crow 2021: The Latest Assault on the Right to Vote."" Debate centered around the voting laws in various stages in state legislatures as well as the Democratic-led ""For the People Act,"" which would put in place federal regulations on running elections, including expanded access to absentee voting and mandates around early voting periods, which states would be required to follow. Republicans pushed back on the idea of federal interference in state-run elections, while Democrats argued the necessity of a federal law in light of conservatives in statehouses across the country, including in Georgia, pursuing changes as to how voters can cast their ballots and who is permitted to vote absentee. California Sen. Alex Padilla pointed to the history of Jim Crow-era tactics that kept minority voters away from the polls. ""Voter suppression is rooted in white supremacy. During the Jim Crow era, we know that racially-targeted, racially-motivated voter suppression was often blatant. Legislatures adopted overtly racist policies like literacy tests and poll taxes in an effort to shape the electorate,"" Padilla, a Democrat, said. ""Today's voter suppression playbook is still rooted in white supremacy and motivated by the same factors as their Jim Crow predecessors but looks different. Overtly racist policies have been replaced by facially neutral ones, like mandated in-person voting requirements, decommissioning of polling sites and manipulated, discriminatory photo ID laws..."" A recent Quinnipiac poll found the nation is split on whether voter fraud or voter suppression is the bigger problem in the country, 43% to 49%, respectively. Fifty-four percent of respondents say they""d like to keep in place the expanded voting access in 2020 due to the coronavirus. But baseless fears of voter fraud -- perpetuated by former President Donald Trump and others -- still exist despite assurances made top Trump administration officials, including former Attorney General Bill Barr, and top Republicans across the country that there were no signs of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. ""I can't help but wonder why, after the Trump administration top elections security official and Georgia's own election officials vouched for the integrity of the last elections, did seemingly every Republican-controlled legislative body in the country... file and move voter suppression bills,"" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said. ""The lie of massive, rampant voter fraud is serving the same function today as it did during the rise of Jim Crow,"" Sherrilyn Ifill, the president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said. ""It stokes fear in a segment of the population that democracy is in peril, and thus provides cover for laws that target Black voters with race-neutral language in the 21st century."" One of the most restrictive elections bills this year has come out of Georgia, a target of Trump""s in the aftermath of the 2020 election. After the state turned blue with the election of President Joe Biden and the flipping of two Senate seats, Republicans pushed and passed SB 202 -- a massive omnibus voting bill that set new guidelines for early, in-person voting and gave the General Assembly greater control over election administration, among other provisions. While some Republicans argue that voters' faith in the system needed to be restored, many Democrats contended Tuesday that Republicans are changing the law in Georgia and other states to solidify wins in subsequent contests -- and that they are targeting Black voters in particular to make that happen. The response to that, they say, is federal legislation. ""If we had not acted in 1965, what would our country look like?"" said Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., who gave testimony at the hearing, referring to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. ""Surely I would not be sitting here, only the 11th Black senator in the history of our country, and the first Black senator in Georgia."" ""And maybe that is the point,"" he added. Republicans said that the point of new legislation is not to disenfranchise Black people and that federal legislation would usurp state's rights. ""Nowhere in the Constitution does it empower the federal government to completely usurp the role of the states in holding elections,"" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said. ""Yet through H.R. 1, Congress is not acting as a check, it's acting like a hijacker to take over the constitutional authority from the states, and acting as a sole arbiter in how an election is running in rural Vermont, or downtown Chicago."" Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the committee, called the title of the hearing ""offensive."" ""At a time when voters on both sides of the aisle have doubts about the integrity of our elections, polarizing rhetoric that distorts history is not helpful,"" he said. He warned against perpetuating claims of voter suppression, saying that ""basic claims of voter suppression are just as corrosive to our democracy as baseless claims of voter fraud."" Still, the hearing kept returning to the question of whether ""Jim Crow"" is at work in new voter legislation in states across the country. ""Let me concede at the outset that Jim Crow at its worst was more violent than the situation we face today,"" Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said Tuesday. ""But I think the bottom-line question which we are addressing in this hearing is whether there is a design or an intent in legislation that is being considered and passed in many states, including the state of Georgia, to limit or restrict the right to vote of minority populations, with the intent of having an influence on the outcome of the election,"" he added. Former state House Democratic leader and voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams said that, in fact, is the intent of the Georgia law. ""The intent, always matters, sir, and that is the point of this conversation, that is the point of the Jim Crow narrative -- that Jim Crow did not simply look at the activity, it looked at the intent, it looks at the behavior and the targeted behaviors that were disproportionately used by people of color,"" she said."
abc|"Georgia state Rep. Park Cannon , the Democrat who was arrested for knocking on Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's door as he signed the state's voting bill, says she will ""keep knocking."" ""I ask you, Georgia, to keep knocking,"" Cannon said at a news conference Thursday outside the state capitol in Atlanta. ""America, keep knocking. All of the marginalized people, keep knocking."" On March 25, Cannon repeatedly knocked on Kemp's office door at the statehouse while he gave remarks after signing into law new voting requirements in Georgia following the results of the 2020 election that flipped the traditionally red state to blue. Cannon was put in handcuffs and forcibly removed from the statehouse. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis announced Wednesday that Cannon won't be prosecuted. Willis said, ""While some of Representative Cannon's colleagues and the police officers involved may have found her behavior annoying, such sentiment does not justify a presentment to a grand jury of the allegations in the arrest warrants or any other felony charges."" Cannon on Thursday thanked Willis and the district attorney's office ""for the thorough and complete investigation of the facts... that led to the dismissal of the felony charges that I faced."" ""The joy that I feel for the dismissal of the charges I face is tempered by the fact that I should have never been arrested,"" she said. Cannon said she knocked that day so Kemp would see the disappointment on her face. ""I knocked on the door where my colleagues had gathered,"" she said. ""I wanted to be in the room."" ""I was not disruptive. I was persistent,"" she said. Cannon said Thursday, by signing the law, ""Brian Kemp began to dismantle everything Black people in America have achieved, earned and worked for since arriving to the Savannah port."" ""We should not sit quietly while white men behind closed doors work to preserve their white power and white privilege,"" she said, calling the law ""one of the most racist pieces of legislation in my lifetime."" Democrats say the sweeping overhaul of Georgia's election code will make it harder for minorities to vote and imposes unnecessary restrictions, including preventing anyone but poll workers to give food and water to voters waiting in line. Long lines are especially common in the Atlanta metro area. President Joe Biden echoed voting rights advocates, calling the bill ""Jim Crow in the 21st century."" But Republicans have claimed it expands voter access in the state, for example, by adding a second mandatory Saturday of early voting for primary and general elections. Republicans said the bill was necessary, in part, because of diminished trust in Georgia's elections. Kemp has said the law will make it ""easy to vote and hard to cheat."" But there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in Georgia's November or January elections. Cannon also said she wants to make sure residents understand the new voting rules. ""Until we have changed the new law, we must understand the new law,"" she said. ABC News' Quinn Scanlan and Julia Jacobo contributed to this report."
abc|"New York's Hamilton County is rural, remote and Republican. It also has one of the highest vaccination rates in the country. In general, vaccine hesitancy is estimated to be higher in rural areas, according to an ABC News analysis of county-level data. Counties with high estimated hesitancy also tend to be younger, poorer and more likely to have been won by former President Donald Trump during the 2020 presidential election . Hamilton defies several of those trends. The county is ""very, very rural,"" according to Bill Farber, the county's board chairman, with a year-round population of fewer than 5,000 residents nestled among the mountains and lakes of New York's Adirondack Park. It's isolated, with infrastructure and technology challenges, including spotty broadband and cell service. There's no hospital nor pharmacy in the county. During a pandemic that's been heavily politicized, it leans Republican, with 68% of residents voting for Trump in the 2020 election. And yet an impressive 65% of people in the county are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, compared with 36% of Americans nationally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . ""We've watched nationally, this political fight over COVID,"" Farber said. ""We defied the odds, didn't we?"" Hamilton managed to sidestep that fight when it came to vaccines in part, he said, because its campaign was driven by the community and involved so many of its members. Schools, as well as a fire house, became vaccination sites. Business owners provided the county with lists of their employees as soon as they were eligible to be vaccinated. Local volunteers and neighbors spread information about the vaccine and talked about how excited they were to have protection against the virus. Hearing from trusted friends and family influenced the attitude of the community, according to Farber. ""That type of localized community conversation is so powerful in educating people, particularly in this day and age when people are so suspicious of politics and government,"" he said. In addition to decoupling politics from public health, Hamilton benefited from having a plan in place when COVID-19 hit. Many small, rural communities don't have public health departments, but Hamilton does, and had a pandemic plan in place for more than a decade, which involved partnering with schools, the fire department, ambulance squad, law enforcement and community leaders. When Adele Burnett, director of tourism in Inlet, one of the small towns in Hamilton, heard that the health department needed help registering people for vaccines, she jumped to volunteer. She and other members of the local COVID-19 task force compiled lists of people they knew were eligible to get vaccinated and called to see if they could register them for vaccines. ""We'd actually pick up the phone and start making calls,"" she said. ""They didn't have to sit there on the computer refreshing the page."" In addition to helping residents overcome technology barriers, the county tried to accommodate people's work schedules by offering vaccine clinics in the evening and on Saturdays. When new cohorts of people became eligible, like restaurant workers, the county tried to tailor clinic hours to target that group, Farber said. Hamilton's older population and high number of front-line workers, like teachers, first responders and restaurant workers, also meant residents were eligible for vaccinations early in the state's rollout. Now, like many places in the country, vaccinations in Hamilton are slowing and the county is looking for new ways to engage the unvaccinated. In addition to partnering with schools to get shots to newly eligible teenagers, the county plans to offer them in grocery store and gas station parking lots, as well as at farmers markets. The county is also looking ahead to summer when Hamilton's population swells as second home owners and tourists flock to the area for boating, fishing and hiking. They're partnering with employers, Farber said, to offer vaccines to seasonal employees at kids summer camps. Despite those efforts, Farber and Burnett acknowledged that getting to 100% vaccination was highly unlikely, even in Hamilton, and that pockets of people would probably remain unvaccinated. Still, Farber thinks this week's CDC announcement about mask wearing for fully vaccinated people could encourage some of the holdouts. Rewarding people for getting vaccinated instead of forcing them to get a shot they're resistant to is in line with the apolitical ethos that's driven Hamilton's successful vaccine rollout thus far. ""Rather than getting caught up in it being a Republican or a Democrat issue, it really was seen as a community issue,"" Farber said. ""I think that was our saving grace.""

abc|"Following the arrest of Rep. Park Cannon D-Ga., for knocking on the door while Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed a sweeping election bill this week, her attorney said Cannon is ""shaken but resolved"" to continue the fight for voting rights in Georgia -- and to clear her name. Cannon faces charges of obstructing law enforcement and disrupting a general assembly session after she repeatedly knocked on the door of Kemp's office as he held a private livestream of the bill signing. The 90-page bill adds new voting requirements for Georgia residents following the results of the 2020 election that flipped the traditionally red state to blue. A viral video of Cannon, who is a Black woman, being forcibly escorted out of the statehouse by Georgia state troopers, even after she identified herself as a state representative, sparked national outrage. She argued that the public and other members of the General Assembly should be allowed to witness the event. ""It reminds us of the 50s and the 60s in Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia and South Carolina,"" Cannon's attorney, Gerald Griggs, said. ""But I think the governor needs to understand that we are not going to sit back on George Wallace type tactics and not respond the same way we responded to George Wallace. So I think the rest of the country needs to take a very strong look at the tactics that are being used in Georgia. The Justice Department needs to get involved. There needs to be passage of the John Lewis Voting Rights Act to protect voting rights. And we need the Justice Department to crack down on the tactics of these local and state officials that are trying to silence voters and silence people."" Griggs said Cannon was arrested in an area that state lawmakers normally have access to and added she did not expect to be apprehended by law enforcement. ""She has access to all parts of the People's House and so there was no indication that the ceremony should have been closed off. Many times when a governor signs bills that are going to go into law, it's open to the public, to the press and to other members of the House of Representatives and the state Senate,"" Griggs said. Griggs told ABC News that Cannon plans to return to the Georgia State Capitol on Monday to keep working. He also said the state of Georgia should expect a ""prolonged legal fight"" even if charges are dismissed. ""She'll be doing the job that she was elected to do for her district and the people of Georgia. And as far as the charges are concerned, they're just allegations at this point. They have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,"" Griggs said. ""The constitution of the state of Georgia is quite clear on that a duly elected representative cannot be arrested during a session. That's a violation of the Constitution unless there are three exceptions: One would be a felony, two would be a breach of the peace and three would be a treason. We believe, based on the facts and evidence that we have uncovered so far, neither of those exceptions apply,"" he added. Griggs said he and Cannon's team are in touch with the district attorney's office and are hopeful that the charges will be dismissed. He also said Kemp and Cannon have not spoken to each other since the incident -- and that Kemp has not reached out. Griggs wouldn't say if Cannon is owed an apology. President Joe Biden, Stacey Abrams, Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock and other prominent Democrats have expressed support for Cannon, many sharing photos that compare her to civil rights protesters in the 1960s. When asked if that was her intention, Griggs said she's trying to ""make sure that the voices of the voters in her district and around the state of Georgia were amplified."" Kemp has defended the bill and his decision to sign it into law and continued to do so Saturday on Fox News. ""Well, I can truthfully look in the camera and ask my African American friends and other African Americans in Georgia to simply find out what's in the bill versus the blank statement of this is Jim Crow or this is voter suppression, or this is racist -- because it is not,"" Kemp said.

abc|"Since GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed a sweeping overhaul of Georgia's election code into law, Democrats have equated it with ""Jim Crow"" laws while Republicans have claimed it actually expands voter access in the state. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki dodged questions from reporters about President Joe Biden's incorrect claim that the new law ends voting at 5 p.m. -- pointing instead to other aspects of the law she said makes it harder to vote. She also said the new law was ""built on a lie"" that the 2020 presidential election was ""stolen"" from former President Donald Trump -- a reference to the baseless narrative that Trump actually won the election. During the legislative process, Republicans said the bill was necessary, in part, because of diminished trust in Georgia's elections. But there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in either the November or January elections in Georgia, which Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and top deputies affirmed repeatedly. But the new law has become its own source of misinformation. Powerful entities on both sides of the political aisle have presented the law in ways that are at times inaccurate, misleading or omit relevant details, and Republicans and Democrats have accused the other of misrepresenting it to their political advantage. So, what's actually in the law versus what's said about it? Here's a breakdown of claims and how they stack up. Biden has repeatedly said this, but it's wrong. In his initial statement about its passage, Biden said the law ""ends voting hours early so working people can't cast their vote after their shift is over."" In separate comments, the president has also said the law ends voting at ""5 o'clock."" This law did not change how long polling precincts are open on Election Day; all are open from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m. statewide. It also did not shorten mandatory voting hours for the early voting period, which starts four Mondays before primary and general elections and lasts until the Friday before the election. Before the new law was signed, the code stated that advance voting must be held weekdays ""during normal business hours."" This was interpreted to mean between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., but the new law clarifies that. The old law also mandated one day of Saturday early voting, from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m., and the new law requires it last until 5 p.m., and be held on two Saturdays. The new law also specifically states that counties have the option to extend advance voting hours to match Election Day hours of 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. There is , however, one provision of the law where the 5 p.m. time is important. If a voter shows up at the wrong polling place on Election Day, that voter cannot successfully vote unless it's after 5 p.m. and they sign an affidavit affirming they are unable to get to their correct polling place in time. Under previous law, out-of-precinct voters could vote provisional ballots at any time on Election Day, and any votes for races they were eligible to vote in, like statewide races, would be counted. Kemp and other Republicans have repeatedly pointed this out when defending the law, and while it's mostly true, they are making one major omission. The new law mandates two Saturdays of early voting, instead of just one previously, for primary and general elections; it also leaves Sunday early voting up to each individual county's discretion, the same as it was before, except now that's clearly articulated in election code. However, what Republicans aren't talking about -- but Democrats and voting rights activists are -- is how it condenses the mandatory advance voting period for runoffs. Excluding the presidential race, every candidate running for office in Georgia must get a majority of the vote to avoid a runoff election. Before this new law passed, the period between a primary or general election and runoff was nine weeks. Now, it will be just four weeks, and there are no mandatory weekend days of early voting before runoffs. While counties are allowed to start early voting ""as soon as possible"" before the runoff, they are only required to allow people to vote Monday through Friday the week before. After MLB's announcement that it would move its All-Star game from Atlanta in protest of the law, Republicans started comparing Georgia's election laws with those in other states. With the game now planned for Denver, GOP politicians are saying that Georgia offers more days of in-person early voting than Colorado, but they're comparing apples and oranges. Starting at least 15 days before an election, vote centers must be open in Colorado and stay open through Election Day, excluding Sundays and the first Saturday, for voters who want to cast ballots in person. Georgia does mandate more days of in-person early voting -- 17 -- than Colorado, but Colorado also has a completely different, universal vote-by-mail system. Every active registered voter is automatically mailed a ballot ahead of every election without having to specifically request one. Under Georgia's new law, state and local election officials aren't allowed to mail absentee applications to voters -- which the secretary of state did for the June primary -- unless they request one. Before the new law was signed, Georgia voters were already required to present a photo ID when voting in person. But under the new law, voters now must have some form of identification to vote by mail and for most, that identification will either be a driver's license or state ID card, which is a photo ID. Republicans argue this is a more ""objective"" way to verify a voter's identity than the ""subjective"" signature matching process, which Trump repeatedly targeted while spreading election disinformation. When applying for an absentee ballot and returning a voted ballot, electors must now include either their driver's license number or state ID number. If a voter does not have one of those, then they must include a photocopy of another accepted form of ID with their application. When returning the ballot, if a voter doesn't have a driver's license or state ID, they must note their date of birth and last four digits of their social security number; if the voter does not have a Social Security number, they must include a photocopy of another form of accepted identification. During debate, Republican lawmakers said that 97% of Georgians eligible to vote have either a driver's license or state ID card, and it's true that Georgians can get a state ID for free. But critics of the law testified in hearings that the potential eligible voters who will face hurdles without a license or state ID number are also most likely to lack the alternative documents, like a birth certificate -- which is what might have kept them from obtaining a state ID card to begin with. So, while photo IDs are not required per se, some voters could be barred from voting if they don't have the right documents or a Social Security number. Democrats and voting rights advocates seized on this provision in the law. There are specifics around what's allowed and what isn't, but effectively, it bans ""line warming"" by making it a misdemeanor for any non-election worker to give voters waiting in line food or beverages, including water. Electioneering was already banned inside polling places, within 150 feet of them and within 25 feet of any voter waiting in line. But this law added that giving or offering to give any money or gifts, including food and beverages , to voters within those perimeters is illegal, too. Poll workers are still allowed to do this and self-service water stations can be set up within the perimeter. While it was not an issue on Nov. 3, long lines are a familiar occurrence for Georgia voters, most significantly in the Atlanta metro area. For the June primary , many Georgians stood in hours-long lines to vote and volunteers brought those voters food and water while they waited. This is true, but the context is important. In 2020, drop boxes were introduced to many Georgia voters for the first time. Under an emergency rule enacted by the State Election Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, counties were given permission to have secure ballot drop boxes, which were required to be under 24/7 video surveillance and on ""government property generally accessible to the public."" Drop boxes were optional, and many counties opted against them. Since the new law requires every county have at least one drop box, some voters will have the option to use them for the first time. But for many voters, especially those living in the large metro counties that took advantage of the emergency rule, the rules around drop boxes are much more stringent now. Unless the governor declares a health emergency, drop boxes must now only be placed inside early voting locations. Voters can also only access them during the early voting period when the locations are open. Because of the early voting period requirement, drop boxes will now be unavailable for the three days preceding an election and on Election Day -- the time when mailing a ballot back is riskiest because it might not arrive on time. There is also a formula to calculate the maximum number of drop boxes allowed per county. During his press conference Saturday blasting the MLB decision, Kemp noted that he used a drop box in November, saying, ""You can do like I did because I was under COVID quarantine and didn't want to go in the polling location -- I went and dropped mine into a drop box. You can still do that. It's in a secure location now."" But since Kemp dropped his ballot in a box on Election Day, he could not have done so under the new law. Voters can still hand-deliver their voted absentee ballots to county election and registration offices, but those singular locations may be less accessible for some voters. After the bill passed, Fair Fight Action CEO Lauren Groh-Wargo said the bill ""allows for a complete takeover of county boards of election and the State Elections Board itself by partisan politicians in the state legislature,"" calling it ""a disgraceful power grab."" The State Election Board has oversight over elections and investigatory powers, including referring potential election law violations to the attorney general or relevant district attorney. Under the new law, the Republican-majority General Assembly does gain new powers over elections. By a simple majority vote, the legislature elects three -- a change from two -- of the State Election Board's five voting members, and that now includes the chairperson. The secretary of state, who Georgians elect to office, becomes a non-voting member of the board and loses his chairmanship. The State Election Board also gained the power to temporarily suspend county or municipal election ""superintendents."" In Georgia, the county boards of elections, and sometimes probate judges, are the ""superintendents."" This means the board could suspend the people responsible for certifying election results and transfer all of their legal responsibilities, including decisions over election personnel, to a temporary replacement."
abc|"For more than 20 years, Americans from all walks of life have been lining up outside Foundry Methodist Church -- just blocks from the White House -- seeking help proving to the government they are who they say they are. ""I tried, but they said you have to have documentation,"" said Connie Folk, who was accompanying her older brother Morris Cole to an appointment with the church's ID ministry . ""I don't know how to do this."" The complicated and costly maze of paperwork and online portals leading to official government identification, like a drivers license or state ID card, has taken on fresh urgency in the pandemic and as more states move to require official ID for casting a ballot . Wyoming this month became the 36th state to mandate ID for in-person voting. Last month, Georgia joined the list of 10 states requiring proof of ID to apply for a ballot to vote by mail. ""Any time you place a requirement to produce ID, it's going to be a barrier for folks who have to go through the process,"" said the Rev. Ben Roberts who oversees Foundry's ID ministry, which has helped thousands of people successfully apply for identification over the years. Even though the next election is months away, voter advocates are ramping up their efforts to help the ID-less, citing lengthy processing delays during the pandemic and because valid identification is necessary before an individual can even register to vote. ""The timing could not be more critical,"" said Kathleen Unger, founder of VoteRiders , a nonpartisan advocacy group helping to close the ID gap nationwide. ""When it comes to voter ID, procrastination is not your friend."" Cole, whose state ID expired years ago, said he has been unable to apply for housing assistance and food stamps. In his home state of Virginia, he is also unable to vote without valid photo ID. ""If you don't have regular access to a computer, if you don't have a credit card, those are almost insurmountable obstacles to obtaining ID,"" said Lisa Holmstead, a Foundry volunteer helping Cole. ""And especially currently, you cannot go in person to obtain a birth certificate."" An estimated 21 million Americans, or 11% of all adults, don't have valid government identification, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan voter advocacy group. ""We know life circumstances happen,"" Roberts said. ""Items get thrown away, or wet or destroyed. People lose them in evictions. People might lose them in a fire or something like that. But the most common thing that we see is they just get destroyed or lost."" Small armies of nonprofit volunteers are staffing ID clinics in dozens of states this spring. The nonpartisan advocacy group Spread the Vote is prioritizing efforts in North Carolina, Florida, Wisconsin, Texas and Georgia, where lawmakers last month enacted a new ID requirement for mail-in ballots.  More than 600 Americans have been helped since last fall. ""We know from the mouths of the people who are trying to get these laws passed that there is a reason that they're doing it. And it's not about voter fraud,"" said Kat Calvin, founder and executive director of Spread the Vote. ""Every reputable study has found that we've had point zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero nine percent, right, like fraud at the polls. We just -- it doesn't happen."" Many state officials of both parties argue that proof of a voter's identity and eligibility should be a basic prerequisite for voting. ""When voting in person in the state of Georgia you must have a photo ID. It only makes sense for the same standard to apply to absentee ballots as well,"" Georgia Gov. Brain Kemp, a Republican, said last month. But critics of the stricter ID laws call them a requirement that excludes. The average cost of a government ID is $40, according to advocates. Add in the price of obtaining the underlying documents -- like a certified birth certificate -- and some see a modern day poll tax. ""I think it is hard to reach any other conclusion other than the fact that there are some politicians who want to manipulate the rules of the game so that some people can participate and some people can't,"" said Myrna Perez, an election law expert with the Brennan Center for Justice. For years, some Republicans have openly boasted about using voter ID requirements to gain a political edge. ""Now we have photo ID (law), and now I think photo ID is gonna make a little bit of a difference as well,"" Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wis., told a local news reporter about why Republicans would have electoral success in the state in 2016. North Carolina GOP activist Don Yelton was forced to resign in 2013 after controversial comments on The Daily Show about his state's voter ID law. ""If it hurts a bunch of college kids as too lazy to get up off their bohunkus and go get a photo ID, so be it,"" he said. In 2012, Pennsylvania House Republican Leader Mike Turzai predicted that a new state voter ID requirement ""is gonna allow (Republican presidential nominee) Gov. (Mitt) Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania -- done."" Democratic President Barack Obama ultimately won Pennsylvania and a second term in 2012. The National Bureau of Economic Research looked at more than a decade of voting trends and concluded that state ID laws had ""no negative effect on registration or turnout, overall or for any group defined by race, gender, age, or party affiliation."" ""In essence, they're saying there's just no evidence that it keeps people out of the polls,"" said Hans von Spakovsky, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. ""Turnout, including of Black and Hispanic voters, has increased greatly."" A 2005 national bipartisan election reform commission co-led by former President Jimmy Carter even said ID laws were a good idea. ""It will not restrict people from voting. It will be uniformly applied throughout the country, and it will be nondiscriminatory,"" Carter said of the commission's recommendation for a national voter ID standard. Such a policy has never been adopted, and nonpartisan voter advocates say a patchwork of state ID laws remains inherently discriminatory. ""Who doesn't have a driver's license? Poor people, communities of color, people who are in communities that have lower incidence of car ownership, which are lower or lower income communities and communities of color,"" said Alex Gulotta, an Arizona voting rights advocate with the group All Voting Is Local. Some researchers also say there's no evidence that voter ID laws have an effect on fraud -- actual or perceived -- emboldening skeptics of stricter rules, even in states like Georgia that offer voter ID for free. ""The free voter ID is only good for voting,"" said Kat Cavlin, founder of Spread the Vote. ""But when you don't know where you're going to sleep at night or how you're going to feed your children, or whether or not you can get a job without going through all of those hoops to get an ID that's only going to help you with something once a year, is not something that most people have the capacity to do."" Von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation, which supports voter ID requirements and the new Georgia election reform law , said even without valid identification many indigent Americans can still exercise their rights. ""If you don't have a Georgia ID, including the free ID that the state will give you, you can instead provide a photocopy of a utility bill, bank statement, paycheck or government document with your name and address on it,"" he said. ""I don't know how anybody could possibly say that is somehow a 'Jim Crow requirement.' It's easily met."" Most Americans support voter ID laws. In Georgia, the support appears even stronger, according to recent polling. A February survey conducted by the Atlanta Journal Constitution found 74% back the new state rules for proof of ID to vote by mail. ""When you simply require a voter, for example to write in the serial number of their state voter ID card, you don't have to worry about signature comparison,"" von Spakovsky said. Still, voting rights advocates say ID requirements are only getting increasingly tough to navigate, leaving volunteers and families in a sprint to close the ID gap. ""Since September, we've helped 700 people,"" said Holmstead, the Foundry volunteer. ""That's just a drop in the bucket. And we have people waiting and waiting for our appointments. We can only do so much, you know."""

The protestors held up signs reading ""Let Us Vote"" and ""Protect Georgia Voting Rights"" as the third round of the Masters was underway Saturday. The law, signed by Gov. Brian Kemp last month, has ignited a national debate over voting rights . Proponents say the law protects the sanctity of the democratic process. Opponents say it is designed to disenfranchise minority voters. ""This bill is death by a thousand cuts,"" said protestor Marla Cureton, reported to be part of a women""s activist group called No Safe Seats. ""Anytime you put new restrictions on how you can vote, that""s voter suppression. We should be making it easier to vote. It""s the patriotic thing to do."" The protest comes on the heels of local and national outcry against the law and the state of Georgia. Major League Baseball announced last week it was moving the 2021 All-Star Game from Atlanta to Denver in protest. The nationwide African Methodist Episcopal Church is among the groups that have called for a Masters boycott. The Augusta National protest elicited mixed responses, reflecting the wider national divide. ""One man passing by shouted an insult against Gov. Kemp,"" the AP reports.

""As an African-American, and as a citizen, I oppose all attempts, explicit and otherwise, to shrink the electorate and reduce access to the ballot,"" Coogler said.

""I will encourage everyone working with me to tap in with the local community directly affected by Senate Bill 202,"" says Coogler. Some Hollywood big wigs feel differently.

Other Georgia-based corporations — including Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola — have been meeting with the activists for weeks and issued statements opposing the voting restrictions. Coca-Cola also hosted a meeting of several companies on April 13 with the faith leaders, but Home Depot did not attend and has since ""ignored a series of follow-up requests, and has failed to speak publicly on the new law,"" the activists — led by AME Bishop Reginald Jackson and representing more than 1,000 churches — said in a notice to media on Tuesday. ""Blacks and others have become wary and frustrated with spending their money (at) companies that do not support us on our right to vote and other issues,"" Jackson said last week. Republicans across the country are using former President Donald Trump""s false claims of voter fraud to back state-level voting changes they say are needed to restore election integrity. Opponents of the moves say they are intended to disenfranchise citizens who tend not to vote Republican. More than 100 US companies including Apple, Amazon , Ford Motor and Starbucks have declared their opposition to voting curbs that a number of states are considering implementing. Home Depot said Tuesday it believes ""all elections should be accessible, fair and secure and support broad voter participation"" and that it would ""continue to work to ensure our associates in Georgia and across the country have the information and resources to vote."" It also said it ran its own initiatives, including registering more than 15,000 of its associates to vote."
ny_post|"It""s beyond ridiculous that Major League Baseball has caved to partisan politics and media hysteria by moving this year""s All-Star Game , plus the draft, out of Atlanta over Georgia""s new election law. Pressured by Democratic politicians and Twitter mobs, MLB is endorsing the overwrought and fundamentally false agitprop campaign. Democrats from President Joe Biden on down denounce the law as ""racist,"" with Biden even calling it — falsely and insultingly — ""Jim Crow."" Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp was right to shoot back by citing Biden""s ""obvious"" failure to read the legislation. The law actually expands voting opportunities by requiring that counties open polls for two Saturdays of early voting. And the ""rigid restrictions"" that Biden calls ""designed to keep people from voting""? Photo or state-issued IDs with absentee ballots, which were already a requirement for in-person voting, and adjusted hours to secure ballot drop boxes. The bill also narrows the window for requesting absentee ballots, which is still generous at over two months, limits ballot drop box locations to more secure sites and gives the state election board more authority to remove and appoint officials. Where""s the ""Jim Crow"" in any of that? As for the ban on giving food and water to those in voting lines: It""s an anti-electioneering measure shared by many other states including New York and Biden""s own Delaware. In short, the anti-Georgia campaign depends on ignorance of the facts and cowardice by those who know better. Notably, the CEO of Georgia-based Delta Airlines, Ed Bastian, bent to boycott threats by proclaiming the reforms ""unacceptable"" and ""based on a lie"" of a fraudulent election — even though he""d joined the negotiations to hammer out the final bill.

ny_post|"The Georgia House of Representatives voted 173-0 Monday to repeal the state""s Civil War-era citizen""s arrest law in response to the shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery. The bill, which still requires the approval of the state Senate, could make the Peach State the first in the US to repeal a law granting residents arrest powers in certain situations, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported . ""Ahmaud""s death is not in vain,"" state Rep. Bert Reeves, the Republican lawmaker who sponsored the bill, said prior to the vote. ""Ahmaud — his life and his legacy — is going to be (an) agent of change,"" Reeves said. ""And in this General Assembly, in 2011, every single one of us have the opportunity to take part in Ahmaud""s legacy."" Arbery, 25, was chased down and shot dead by three white men while jogging through a Brunswick neighborhood on Feb. 23, 2020 — with his attackers saying they thought he was a burglar who had targeted the area. The case lingered for months until video footage of the incident was made public. All three men — Gregory McMichael, his son Travis and William ""Roddie"" Bryan — were civilians, although the elder McMichael was a former cop and DA""s investigator. All three are currently being held without bail pending trial on murder charges. The state""s House Bill 479 would undo the statute that currently allows civilians to take the law into their own hands — as appeared to be the case in Arbery""s death. According to the Journal-Constitution, the current state law dates to 1863, and was originally intended to allow Georgians to hunt down slaves who fled to join the Union Army during the Civil War. The law currently allows residents to arrest someone based ""upon reasonable and probable grounds of suspicion."" Critics maintain it has served to legally justify racial profiling. ""I know that there were decades of lynchings that happened in Georgia (where) this law was used as justification,"" Reeves said. The proposed law would still allow workers at businesses, security officers, private investigators, and inspectors at truck-scale stops to make arrests. Democratic state Rep.

""At this moment in time, the Nation is coming to terms with its history and is attempting to eliminate vestiges of institutional racism to achieve true racial justice,"" Fuqua and Smith said in a joint statement. ""We cannot in good conscience provide economic support to a government that enacts regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access,"" the statement added.

ny_post|"Accused Atlanta-area spas shooter Robert Aaron Long reportedly had no trouble buying a gun at a firearms dealership in Cherokee County on the day of the attacks — thanks to Georgia""s no-wait gun laws. The Peach State does not require a waiting period for firearm sales, which means a person may purchase one from a federally licensed gun seller immediately if they pass a background check. Long, who was charged with four counts of murder and one count of assault for the first shooting in Cherokee County, bought a gun from Big Woods Goods in Cherokee County, Matt Kilgo, an attorney for the store, confirmed to Newsweek . He said the store is cooperating with investigators and that there is ""absolutely zero indication"" there was anything improper with the firearm sale. ""Most background checks, if there""s no flag on it, take about 100 seconds,"" Robyn Thomas, executive director of Giffords Law Center, a national gun violence prevention advocacy group, told the mag. ""So you""re talking about two minutes at most and then you have your gun, you can walk out the door with no training, no other kind of information,"" she added. Giffords has given Georgia — which has the 14th-highest gun death rate in the US — an ""F"" on its annual scorecard of gun laws in all 50 states, according to the outlet. Republican lawmakers are now pushing for new legislation that would allow ""lawful weapons carriers"" to pack heat without a license. On Wednesday, Matthew Wilson, a Democratic Georgia state representative, said in a tweet that ""in Georgia, it""s easier to buy a gun than it is to vote."" Mike Wilensky, another state representative, called for a law that requires a waiting period for gun buyers, ""I have never heard of someone in a rush to get a gun for a safe, good reason,"" he said in a tweet. Ten states and the District of Columbia require waiting periods for gun purchases — with periods ranging from 72 hours in Illinois to about 10 days in California and DC, according to Newsweek. ""I would really encourage Georgia and other states across the country to look at what happened here and think about what they could do in order to reduce or prevent such incidents from happening again,"" Igor Volsky, executive director of the advocacy group Guns Down America, told the outlet. He cited a 2017 study by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which found that waiting period laws that delay gun purchases by a few days reduce firearm homicides by about 17 percent. ""This is particularly pertinent obviously against the backdrop of the spike we""ve seen in hate crimes in this country. We""re at a 10-year high,"" Volsky told Newsweek.

cbs|"Arizona is getting rid of its permanent early voting list and removing some voters from that list, as a result of the new law signed by Republican Governor Doug Ducey on Tuesday. The state Senate passed the bill, SB 1485 , earlier in the day. Under the old law, voters on the permanent list automatically received a mail ballot for every election. The new law changes the name of the ""permanent early voting list"" to ""active early voting list"" and will remove voters from the list if they do not vote early at least once in a primary, general or municipal election during two consecutive election cycles. Election officials are to send voters a notice that they are going to be removed from the list, and voters will have 90 days to respond if they would like to remain on the list. It does not prevent people from voting in person and the voter remains registered. ""This change will ensure that active voters continue to receive a ballot,"" Ducey said in a video statement . He added that the bill is all about ""election integrity"" and is part of the ""continuous change and improvements that have made our elections safer, more responsive and better for our citizens."" Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs opposed the bill. She noted in a letter to Ducey in April that Arizona already has a process for removing inactive voters from the list. The changes ""aren't just unnecessary - they're detrimental to voters,"" she wrote. The bill passed 16-14 along party lines. It was initially held up in April when GOP Senator Kelly Townsend said she was not going to vote on any election bills until after an audit of the 2020 election in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, was finished. The audit was ordered by the GOP-controlled Senate and election experts have raised concerns about how it is being conducted. Townsend reversed her position and backed the measure on Tuesday, even though the audit is not finished. She said she was told that lawmakers would examine other changes to election laws before the session ends. ""I have been reassured and convinced it is OK to move forward because we are now looking at other issues that need to be fixed for the 2022 election,"" Townsend said, according to the Arizona Republic . Republicans argued that the bill will help maintain the state's voter rolls to ensure the list of voters who automatically receive a mail ballot is accurate and raised concerns that unvoted ballots could be at risk for fraud. Democrats have said it's an effort to prevent voters from obtaining mail ballots automatically. Arizona Senate Democrats said in a statement the bill would ""purge over 120,000 eligible Arizonans"" from the list. ""The true intent of this bill is undeniable and that is to suppress the votes of low-income, Black, Latino and Native American voters,"" Senate Democrats said. The Navajo Nation opposed SB 1485. Townsend recently posted an assessment from the Arizona Legislative Council that said the bill does not apply retroactively to elections held before it was passed. That means four years would need to pass before voters would start to be removed from the list. Arizona has had mail voting in place since 1991 and it has been regularly used by voters in the state. In 2016, when former President Trump won the state by about 91,000 votes, about 76% cast their ballot early or by mail, according to data from the Arizona secretary of state's office. In 2020, when President Biden won the state by about 11,000 votes, about 88% voted early or by mail. Republicans in Arizona passed SB 1485 as GOP-controlled state legislatures around the country have been pushing to amend their voting laws. Lawmakers in Iowa , Florida and Georgia are among those who passed sweeping election bills. Republicans in Texas advanced a bill last week that would change the state's voting laws."
cbs|"Washington — Several battleground states controlled by Republicans have pushed for big changes in voting and election laws in recent months, in the wake of former President Donald Trump's electoral loss and a rise in mail-in voting due to the coronavirus pandemic. These states are considering changes to election laws, such as measures to enforce additional ID requirements, restrict access to dropboxes and shrink the pool of voters. Arizona, Florida, and Texas each have growing and increasingly diverse populations and play a substantial role in the outcome of presidential contests. All three have Republican legislatures and governorships. Michigan has a Democratic governor, but its Republican-controlled legislature is considering several bills that could make absentee voting more difficult. Arizona and Michigan narrowly supported President Biden in the 2020 election, and Mr. Trump won Florida and Texas. Georgia, which Mr. Biden also won, has already passed a controversial voting law including some new restrictions. Here is a rundown of some of the key states states proposing changes to voting and election laws: The Arizona state legislature has proposed multiple bills to tighten its election laws, including one to shrink the pool of early voters. Most Arizona voters have been casting their ballots by mail for years, since the state started allowing mail-in voting for every registered voter 30 years ago. S.B. 1485 , which would eliminate the permanent early voting list that allows voters to automatically receive a mail ballot for every election, is still under consideration. It would remove from the list voters who do not use their early voting ballot in two consecutive election cycles. The bill passed twice in the state Senate earlier this year, and an amended version was passed in the House last month. A vote on the amended version failed, as GOP state Senator Kelly Townsend she would not vote on any voting-related bill until after Senate Republicans complete a recount and audit of the 2020 general election results in Maricopa County . The bill is now under a motion to reconsider at a later date. Democrats have criticized the audit ordered by Senate Republicans, which is being overseen by a Florida-based technology company that is being paid $150,000. Private donors have also contributed to funding for the audit, which may stretch beyond May 14, the target deadline for its conclusion. A state superior court judge has ordered the private contractor conducting the audit to reveal its policies and procedures. The audit is part of a GOP effort to question the results of the Arizona presidential election, which Mr. Biden won by more than 10,000 votes. Another key election bill under consideration is S.B. 1713 , which adds an ID requirement for people voting absentee. This bill would require voters to provide a number from a driver's license, state ID, tribal ID or their voter registration number, in addition to providing a signature when returning an absentee ballot. Townsend's opposition has also temporarily blocked the passage of this bill. The Florida legislature passed a sweeping elections bill last week that would make significant changes to mail voting in the state. A record number of Floridians voted by mail in the 2020 election. The bill would add ID requirements for voters requesting to vote by mail, requiring voters to provide either their driver's license or state ID number or the last four digits of their Social Security number when asking for a mail ballot. Voters would also have to provide this information to register to vote or to update their registration. Other provisions include limiting drop box locations, restricting the hours some drop boxes can be accessed and giving more power to partisan poll watchers during certain points of the ballot review. It would also ban private funds for elections, limit who can return absentee ballots, put new requirements in place for settling lawsuits over election law and expand the radius of outside groups ""engaging in any activity with the intent to influence"" voters to 150 feet. Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis has praised his state's handling of the 2020 election, but said the bill is about making further improvements. ""We think we led the nation, but we're trying to stay ahead of the curve to make sure that these elections are run well,"" DeSantis told Fox News last week. DeSantis signed the bill on Thursday morning, barring all media except Fox News from attending the signing. Democrats said the new rules will make it more difficult to vote. ""You don't place deliberate barriers in folks' way and call it security,"" said Democratic State Representative Tracie Davis. ""This is an insult to me personally and this is an insult to the millions of voters that depend on us to make decisions for them especially when it comes to election law."" The Michigan Senate has been holding hearings on some of the election bills that Republicans introduced in March. The legislative package would make significant changes to the state's election process. There are bills that add ID requirements for absentee and in-person voting . Currently, voters who do not have an ID can sign an affidavit affirming their identity, but the new bills would require a voter to cast a provisional ballot and later verify their identity. Drop boxes were used throughout Michigan in 2020, the first election cycle since voters passed a constitutional amendment allowing no-excuse absentee voting, and again during May local elections. But GOP lawmakers want to require approval for drop box locations and have officials lock boxes at 5 p.m. the day before an election. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, has called the slate of proposals ""poisonous."" Republican State Senator Ruth Johnson, who was secretary of state before Benson, has called the measures ""common sense"" ways to ensure ""our elections are safe and secure."" There was no credible evidence of widespread fraud in Michigan during the 2020 election. If Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer vetoes any of the bills passed by the legislature, state GOP leaders have suggested they will start a petition initiative to turn them into law. If they get about 340,000 signatures, the legislature can vote on the petition initiative and a simple majority can approve it without the governor's signature. ""If that legislation is not passed by our legislature, which I'm sure it will be, but if it's not signed by the governor then we have other plans to make sure it becomes law before 2022,"" Michigan GOP Chair Ron Weiser told party activists in March. The Texas state legislature is considering omnibus bills, H.B. 6 and S.B. 7, which would significantly restrict voting rights. S.B. 7 would create new restrictions on early voting and how voters can receive applications to vote by mail, as well as regulating the distribution of polling places in urban counties. But the House Elections Committee voted late last month to gut S.B. 7 and replace its language to line up with H.B. 6. The version of S.B. 7 passed out of the House committee includes provisions to restrict distribution of vote-by-mail applications and enhance protections for partisan poll watchers. It was then approved by the full House early Friday morning with significant revisions after a late-night session. The revisions lowered many of the initial criminal penalties imposed for voting errors. There are fewer penalties for people assisting voters or election judges who make mistakes doing their jobs. People assisting voters still need to sign a document under penalty of perjury that says, in part, ""I did not pressure, encourage, coerce, or intimidate the voter into choosing me to provide assistance."" Lawmakers also added more checks on partisan poll watchers than the bill had when debate started. The House version of S.B. 7 will need one more vote in the state House before it goes back to the Senate. It also lacks some of the more controversial provisions included in the original Senate bill. Texas' legislative session ends on May 31. Meanwhile, several standalone bills that are versions of provisions in H.B. 6 and S.B. 7 have moved in the legislature, advancing in committees. Other bills not directly related to the omnibus voting legislation include measures to require voters to provide a Texas driver's license or state ID number when applying for and returning a mail ballot and prohibiting return of mail ballots to unattended receptacles other than mailboxes or common carrier receptacles. The business community has expressed concern about efforts to restrict voting rights. Dozens of major companies — including HP, American Airlines, Microsoft and Unilever — released a letter on Tuesday  opposing ""any changes that would restrict eligible voters' access to the ballot."" This action comes after several corporations criticized the elections law in Georgia, leading some Republican lawmakers to threaten further regulation in response."
cbs|"Major professional sports unions in the U.S. are taking a stand against restrictive voting rights bills proposed in several states, including Georgia, where a controversial bill passed in March. The Basketball Players Union, Major League Soccer Players Association, National Football League Players Association and United States Women's National Team Players Association are among the nine unions that signed a letter Monday, condemning legislation ""that if passed, could make it harder for ordinary citizens to cast their ballots in future election seasons."" The unions said they oppose states' legislative efforts ""aimed at restricting the right to vote,"" and that they ""join the hundreds of individuals, foundations and corporations in taking a 'Stand for Democracy.'"" Similarly, some executives at Georgia-headquartered companies like Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines issued public statements opposing the state's voting rights bill last month. Major League Baseball also made a statement against the Georgia bill, pulling its Midsummer Classic from Atlanta. The league moved the All-Star game to Coors Field in Denver over objections to the sweeping changes to the state's voting laws . JPMorgan Chase, ViacomCBS, Citi and Microsoft also joined opposition the law which, among other things, requires a photo ID in order to vote absentee by mail. The law also limits the time period allotted to request an absentee ballot and where ballot drop boxes can be placed. Democrats and voting rights groups have criticized the bill, saying such changes to voting rights amount to the 2021 version of Jim Crow rules and other historical efforts to suppress the vote to gain a political advantage. Proponents argue the measures, proposed in the wake of the 2020 election, are necessary to fight election fraud, though the Department of Justice stated there was no widespread voter fraud in the presidential election. Critics say the law will disproportionately impact voters of color, and Georgia's NAACP chapter is challenging the measure in federal court . Legislatures in Arizona, Texas and Florida are also considering proposals for additional ID requirements, restrictions on dropboxes, and cuts to private funding for local election offices. In the letter opposing restrictive legislation, the nine sports unions, said: ""We Stand for Democracy. A Government of the people, by the people. A beautifully American ideal, but a reality denied to many for much of this nation's history."" ""As Americans, we know that in our democracy we should not expect to agree on everything,"" the letter reads. ""However, regardless of our political affiliations, we believe the very foundation of our electoral process rests upon the ability of each of us to cast our ballots for the candidates of our choice."" The letter says in order for ""American democracy to work for any of us, we must ensure the right to vote for all of us,"" and that we should all feel responsible ""to defend the right to vote and to oppose any discriminatory legislation or measures that restrict or prevent any eligible voter from having an equal and fair opportunity to cast a ballot."" ""Voting is the lifeblood of our democracy and we call upon all Americans to join us in taking a nonpartisan stand for this most basic and fundamental right of all Americans,"" the letter says."
cbs|"""Emancipation,"" a thriller about a runaway slave starring actor Will Smith, will move its production out of Georgia because of the state's new voting laws , the movie's director Antoine Fuqua and Smith announced Monday. A statement released by Fuqua and Smith through Smith's media production company Westbrook Inc . said the new Georgia law is ""reminiscent of voting impediments that were passed at the end of Reconstruction to prevent many Americans from voting."" The decision makes Emancipation, which is financed by Apple Studios, the first major production to leave Georgia and shoot elsewhere after a slew of major corporations spoke out against the legislation. ""At this moment in time, the Nation is coming to terms with its history and is attempting to eliminate vestiges of institutional racism to achieve true racial justice,"" Fuqua and Smith said in a statement. ""We cannot in good conscience provide economic support to a government that enacts regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access."" ""Regrettably, we feel compelled to move our film production work from Georgia to another state,"" they added. The movie was scheduled to start shooting in Georgia on June 21. According to Deadline , talks are underway to shoot the film in the Louisiana, where events of the plot take place. Smith will play Peter, a fugitive from slavery who goes on a harrowing journey north of the state, according to Westbrook Inc. The new law on Georgia's 7.4 million voters contains new restrictions on absentee voting, while at the same time expanding early voting opportunities. It expands early voting access for some Georgia voters, adds an ID requirement for absentee voting, codifies the use of drop boxes with strict rules on how they can be used and sets new rules for state and local election officials. Some Democrats and voting rights groups were outraged by voter ID provisions and changes to mail voting that they believe will make more difficult for some minorities and poorer voters to cast a ballot.  Within days of its passing in late March, corporations spoke out against the bill and Major League Baseball pulled its All-Star Game out of the state.

cbs|"Washington — The Georgia NAACP and voting rights organizations on Monday filed a lawsuit to block a sweeping new law in Georgia that imposes new restrictions on voting , the latest in a slew of legal battles expected to take aim at the measure. The suit was filed in the federal district court in Atlanta just days after Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed the GOP-backed measure into law. The law is the first to usher in new changes to voting procedures following the 2020 presidential election, which former President Donald Trump claimed without evidence was rigged against him and rife with widespread voter fraud. ""The thinly-veiled attempt to roll back the progress we have made to empower Georgians — to use their voices in the democratic process — creates an arbitrary law that does not improve voter confidence, secure election integrity nor increase access to the ballot box,"" the Reverend James Woodall, state president of Georgia NAACP, said in a statement. The coalition of groups challenging the law argue it is the ""culmination of a concerted effort to suppress the participation of Black voters and other voters of color"" by the Republican-led legislature after demographic changes in Georgia led to statewide Democratic wins, most recently in the state's presidential race and two Senate races, which flipped the balance of power in the upper chamber. ""Unable to stem the tide of these demographic changes or change the voting patterns of voters of color, these officials have resorted to attempting to suppress the vote of Black voters and other voters of color in order to maintain the tenuous hold that the Republican Party has in Georgia,"" the suit alleges. ""In other words, these officials are using racial discrimination as a means of achieving a partisan end."" These effort, the groups argue, violate the Constitution and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting rules that discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. Georgia's elections law requires providing a driver's license or state ID number or photocopy of an ID to vote absentee by mail and limits the time people have to request an absentee ballot. It also restricts the locations of ballot drop boxes and when they can be accessed, and expands early voting on weekends. The new law also bans people from delivering food or drinks to people within 150 feet of a polling site, but allows for self-service water. The measure makes changes to the State Election Board, which the NAACP argues effectively grants the board the power to take over county election boards. While Republicans argue the voting overhaul will restore confidence in the integrity of Georgia's elections, Democrats say it restricts voting access and disproportionately harms Black and Latino voters. On Thursday, President Biden called the election bills spearheaded by Republicans in Georgia and other states in the wake of the November election ""un-American"" and ""sick."" More than 250 bills that would restrict voting access have been introduced in 43 states, according to the Brennan Center for Justice . Mr. Biden has urged Congress to pass legislation that would effectively counter the state-level efforts from Republicans to change voting rules and said the Justice Department is ""taking a look"" at the Georgia law. The NAACP lawsuit marks the second legal challenge to Georgia's elections law. On Thursday, a coalition of voting and civil rights groups sued Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and the State Election Board in the Northern District of Georgia. The suit argues the law was ""clearly intended to and will have the effect of making it harder for lawful Georgia voters to participate in the state's elections"" and will ""impose these unjustifiable burdens disproportionately on the state's minority, young, poor and disabled citizens."" Following the general election, Mr. Trump and some Georgia Republicans claimed there was mass voter fraud in the state's election after Mr. Biden became the first Democrat to win Georgia since 1992. Two recounts affirmed Mr. Biden's win and a signature audit found no widespread fraud. Still, Kemp said Thursday after signing the bill into law that ""significant reforms to our state elections were needed"" following the November election. The law takes another step towards ensuring Georgia's elections ""are secure, accessible and fair,"" he said. Raffensperger has defended Georgia's elections system over the claims of voter fraud mounted by Mr. Trump and rebuffed pressure from the former president to overturn the results of the presidential election. In a statement Friday, Raffensperger, too, defended Georgia's new law and shot back at critics who say the changes amount to voter suppression. ""The cries of 'voter suppression' from those on the left ring as hollow as the continuously debunked claims of 'mass voter fraud' in Georgia's 2020 election,"" he said. ""We don't have systemic voter suppression, and we don't have mass voter fraud. What we have is systemic lies for political gain that have led to a loss of public confidence in our elections."""
cbs|"Major League Baseball is moving the 2021 All-Star Game and 2021 draft out of Atlanta in response to Georgia's controversial new voting law , the league announced Friday. ""I have decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year's All-Star Game and MLB Draft,"" Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement . ""Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box."" Discussions of moving the game surfaced after Georgia recently passed a strict new voting law, which critics say is designed to disenfranchise voters of color. It requires a photo ID in order to vote via absentee ballot, which more than 1.3 million Georgia voters did during the coronavirus pandemic. The new law limited the locations for dropboxes and the time voters have to request an absentee ballot. It also outlaws passing out food and water to voters within 150 feet of a polling place or within 25 feet of any voter standing in line, a particularly controversial provision as there are often longer lines to vote in disproportionately Black precincts. Manfred's decision came two days after President Biden endorsed moving the game out of Atlanta in an interview with ESPN. ""I think today's professional athletes are acting incredibly responsibly. I would strongly support them doing that. People look to them. They're leaders,"" Mr. Biden said. The president has called the new Georgia law ""Jim Crow on steroids."" However, some Georgia Democrats expressed disappointment in the move. The All-Star Game is one of the league's premier events and the city of Atlanta will be losing out on a considerable financial gain. Past cities have seen as much as $60 million in economic boosts, according to data from the Baseball Almanac. ""Like many Georgians, I am disappointed that MLB is relocating its All-Star game; however, I commend the players, owners and league commissioner for speaking out. I urge others in positions of leadership to do so as well,"" said Stacey Abrams, one of the state's most prominent Democrats and a voting rights activist. Senator Raphael Warnock called the move ""the unfortunate consequence"" of the law's passage. Georgia Republicans, meanwhile, are not backing down. In a press conference on Saturday, Governor Brian Kemp decried ""cancel culture"" as the root of Manfred's decision. ""Secure, accessible elections are worth the threats. They are worth the boycotts as well as the lawsuits. I want to be clear — I will not be backing down from this fight,"" Kemp said. ""What are they going to do if the Braves get in the playoffs? Are they going to move the damn playoff game? Are they going to move it to other states with more restrictions than we have?"" The move was also criticized by former President Trump, who in a statement called on his supporters to ""boycott baseball and all of the woke companies that are interfering with free and fair elections."" The league has not yet announced a new host city but said the decision is in the process of being finalized. The All-Star Game is scheduled to take place on July 13 and will still pay tribute to baseball legend Hank Aaron. Khristopher J. Brooks contributed reporting."
cbs|"Just days after Coca-Cola, Delta and other major corporate names publicly denounced  Georgia's controversial voting law , civil rights groups are raising the heat on big companies to help combat similar proposals across the U.S. Activists are urging Georgia-based companies like Delta, Home Depot and UPS to stop funding the political campaigns of Republican legislators behind the state's move to restrict voting rights. They also want companies to put their brands behind publicity campaigns that openly oppose similar voter law proposals in Arizona, Florida and Texas, as well as to take a stand in favor of bills in Congress aimed at expanding access to the ballot box. Georgia lawmakers passed a measure that requires voters to present a photo ID when voting by mail. The law also cuts the time people have to request an absentee ballot and limits where ballot drop boxes can be placed. Critics charge that such changes amount to the 2021 version of Jim Crow rules and other historical efforts to suppress the vote to gain a political advantage. The push from activists comes in the same week as 72 Black business executives calling for companies to speak out against Georgia's voting law. In a letter addressed to corporate America, former American Express CEO Ken Chenault and other Black leaders noted that more than 40 states are considering election changes similar to Georgia. ""What we're saying to companies is all of the words are nice, but we need you to take action,"" Chenault told CBS This Morning. Coca-Cola, Delta and Home Depot have largely stayed mum on what concrete steps they favor to help repeal the Georgia voting law. UPS stopped short of saying it would halt political donations. Instead, it is offering less assertive measures, saying it plans to print absentee ballots for employees who ask, offer its employees to work as volunteers at polling sites on election days, and fund organizations that hold voter registration drives. Large corporations ""know how to squash legislation that impacts their own company or industry,"" said Cliff Albright, executive director of the Georgia-based political action group Black Voters Matter. ""We expect them to do the same here."" Activists said companies should immediately stop making donations to Barry Fleming and Michael Dugan, the Georgia Republicans who co-sponsored the voting changes. Doing that ""doesn't mean they have to stop giving to the entire Republican Party,"" just those lawmakers, Albright said. Coca-Cola has contributed $34,750 to Fleming's and Dugan's campaigns since 2018, according to data from Popular Information, a left-leaning political newsletter. Delta has donated $41,600 in total to the lawmakers while Home Depot has kicked in $34,000 and UPS has given $34,500. There is recent precedent for companies now embroiled in the Georgia fight for pulling back on their support for lawmakers. In January, Coca-Cola and UPS were among the many Fortune 500 companies that stopped contributing to Republicans in Washington who falsely claimed that former President Trump lost the 2020 election due to voter fraud. Ending political donations is one of the most immediately impactful steps a company can take to sway lawmakers, said Nse Ufot, CEO of New Georgia Project, a voter rights organization. That's because Coca-Cola, UPS and the others ""have the most powerful lobbyists and have the biggest influence in Georgia politics,"" he said. Albright noted that America's best-known brands have vast experience persuading Americans to buy their products, whether a plane ticket from Delta or cans of paint from Home Depot. Major advertising campaigns have helped these companies individually, but ads can also help stamp out efforts nationwide to pass voting laws similar to Georgia's, activists said. Arizona and Texas could be the next states to alter voting rights, with lawmakers there considering proposals for additional ID requirements, restrictions on drop boxes and cuts to private funding for local election offices. In Arizona, SB 1713 adds the ID requirement for voting absentee. In Texas, the state senate passed SB 7 this week, a sweeping bill that would add many voting restrictions. Black Voters Matter picketed the Dallas offices of AT&T on Monday, criticizing its political donations to the leading Texas Republicans behind the voting legislation. Activists say it isn't enough for companies to issue tepid public statements in defense of voting rights. Instead, companies should launch television and social media ads that oppose efforts in Georgia, Arizona, Texas and other states considering voter restrictions, Albright said. ""The same way they try to convince people to have a Coke and a smile, they need to persuade people to fight voter suppression,"" he said. ""They can use all their skills, tools, marketing departments and their budgets."" As Arizona, Florida, Texas and other states mull changes to local voting rules, the federal government is also weighing an election law overhaul known as the ""For the People Act ."" If passed, the act would create same-day and online voter registration nationwide. It would also require states to overhaul their registration systems. The act seeks to expand absentee voting, limit the states' ability to remove people from voter rolls, increase federal funds for election security and reform the redistricting process. Albright said corporate chiefs must offer to testify before federal lawmakers in favor of the bill. Creating a separate public awareness campaign for that bill also would help, he added. Companies ""need to work aggressively to call for the passage"" of the For the People Act , Ufot said."
cbs|"Major U.S. companies and sports teams are starting to publicly condemn a controversial new voting law recently passed in Georgia , nearly a week after Black clergymen around the state and voting-rights advocates began criticizing corporations for their silence and threatening some of them with boycotts. Top executives at Georgia-headquartered giants Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, as well as the country's biggest bank, JPMorgan Chase, are now issuing public statements that call the legislation ""wrong"" and ""based on a lie"" and vowing unspecified action to help change it. Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Wednesday that voting must be accessible to all Americans. While not specifically referencing Georgia, Dimon said Chase stands against efforts that prevent Americans from being able to vote. Meanwhile, Delta CEO Ed Bastian told employees in an internal memo Wednesday that the law ""does not match Delta's values."" ""After having time to now fully understand all that is in the bill, coupled with discussions with leaders and employees in the Black community, it's evident that the bill includes provisions that will make it harder for many underrepresented voters, particularly Black voters, to exercise their constitutional right to elect their representatives,"" Bastian said. ""That is wrong."" Citi and Microsoft also expressed concerns about the Georgia law Wednesday. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey told CNBC on Wednesday that Georgia's new voting law is ""unacceptable"" and ""a step backwards."" ""This legislation is wrong and needs to be remediated,"" Quincey said. ""We'll continue to advocate in both private and even more clearly in public."" The Atlanta Hawks basketball team and Atlanta Falcons football team also expressed disdain with the law. ""The right to vote is simply sacred,"" Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank said in a statement . ""We should be working to make voting easier, not harder for every eligible citizen."" The Georgia law, among other things, requires a photo ID in order to vote absentee by mail. That's an option that more than 1.3 million Georgia voters used during the coronavirus pandemic . It also cuts the time people have to request an absentee ballot and limits where ballot drop boxes can be placed. Democrats and voting rights groups said the law will disproportionately impact voters of color. Georgia's NAACP chapter is challenging the measure in federal court . Georgia. Gov. Brian Kemp insisted the new voting law was being misrepresented by the corporate chieftains. He also accused some business leaders of ignoring their role in the law's development. In a statement Wednesday, Kemp said Bastian's criticism of the voting law ""stands in stark contrast to our conversations with the company, ignores the content of the new law, and unfortunately continues to spread the same false attacks being repeated by partisan activists."" Bastian, Dimon and Quincey didn't offer details on how their companies plan to combat Georgia's law, but offered to keep their eye on its impact in the coming months. Delta initially issued a statement touting some parts of the law, such as expanded weekend voting, but said ""we understand concerns remain over other provisions in the legislation and there continues to be work ahead in this important effort."" The law, which passed last week, has sparked calls for boycotts of major Georgia-based companies including Coca-Cola, Delta, Home Depot and UPS because those companies had not spoken out against it. Home Depot and UPS still haven't publicly opposed the law so far. Perhaps part of the reason some Americans hope to hear those companies' stances is because Coca-Cola, Delta and Home Depot have governing boards that are more diverse than the average S&P 500 firm. Four out of 15 of UPS' board members are people of color, or nearly 30%. A recent study by recruiting firm Spencer Stuart found that at the 200 largest companies in the S&P 500-stock index, an average of 10% of their corporate board members were Black. Latino directors made up another 4%. For Coca-Cola, three of its 12 board members, or 25%, are people of color, while Delta and Home Depot have two diverse board members out of 12, or 17%. A group of 72 Black business executives are hoping even more major companies will denounce Georgia's changes. In a letter addressed to corporate America, former American Express CEO Ken Chenault and other Black leaders noted that more than 40 states are considering election changes similar to Georgia. Chenault said companies must pick a side: Either you want more people to vote or you believe in voter suppression. ""The reality is, corporations have been silent on this issue and that is why we've said action has to be taken,"" Chenault told ""CBS This Morning."" The Associated Press contributed to this report."
cbs|"Georgia's 98-page election law , passed by a GOP-controlled legislature and signed by Republican Governor Brian Kemp at the end of March, has stirred a nationwide debate over voting rights in the wake of the 2020 election . Democrats and voting rights groups were outraged by voter ID provisions and changes to mail voting that they believe will make more difficult for some minorities and poorer voters to cast a ballot. Within days, major corporations, including Georgia-based Coca-Cola and Delta, along with CBS News' parent company ViacomCBS, spoke out against the bill, and Major League Baseball pulled its All-Star Game out of Georgia a day after President Biden threw his support behind the idea. In writing the bill, Georgia lawmakers debated several high-profile changes to voting laws, including banning Sunday voting, a tradition for Black voters following church services, and getting rid of no-excuse absentee voting, a measure passed by Republicans in 2005, neither of which made it into the new law. The effect of the new law on Georgia's 7.4 million voters will be mixed: it contains new restrictions on absentee voting, while at the same time expanding early voting opportunities. The law also formalizes provisions that were put in place to accommodate voters during the coronavirus pandemic and changes the composition of the state election board, which is charged with conducting all of Georgia's elections. The law does make significant changes to the way the state will run elections moving forward. It expands early voting access for some Georgia voters, adds an ID requirement for absentee voting, codifies the use of drop boxes with strict rules on how they can be used and sets new rules for state and local election officials. Here are 9 facts about the new Georgia voting law: Nearly 2.7 million Georgians voted early during the 2020 general election and the new law will offer more opportunities for early voting in most of Georgia's counties. There will be at least 17 days of early voting, starting on the Monday that is 22 days before Election Day until the Friday before an election. The bill requires counties to have at least two Saturdays of early voting, with the option of offering voting on Sundays as well. Previously, Georgia required only one Saturday of early voting. Many of the larger counties, where most Georgia voters live, already offered early voting on two Saturdays, but the new law will expand access to early voting in many of the smaller, more rural counties. Counties must operate early voting from at least 9 a.m. until 5 p.m., but can offer it from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m. if they choose to offer expanded hours. Previously in Georgia, a form of identification was required for voting in person but not for voting absentee by mail. The new law requires those requesting and returning ballots by mail to also submit a driver's license number or state ID number. If the voter does not have one, he or she can submit a photocopy of a different form of identification. The county registrar's offices or the Georgia Department of Driver Services can issue free state ID cards. When a voter returns an absentee ballot, he or she can also provide the last four digits of their Social Security number in place of an ID number. This provision replaces a signature requirement for verifying a person's identification, and it's opposed by voting rights groups who point to some studies that show that voter ID requirements tend to disproportionately affect voters of color. At the same time, incomplete or mismatched signatures have often caused ballots to be rejected. In the June 2020 primary, about 3,200 of 1.1 million mail ballots were rejected for signature issues, according to a CBS News analysis last year. As a result, the ID requirement could help election officials process ballots more efficiently. While no-excuse absentee voting has been in place in Georgia since 2005, the state didn't authorize the use of secure drop boxes as a way to return ballots until the 2020 election, as a response to the pandemic. The new law mandates at least one drop box per county, but restricts where they may be placed and when they may be accessed. They must be located inside the clerk's office or inside a voting location and are only going to be accessible during early voting hours, and then closed when the early voting period ends. This is a departure from the 2020 elections, when drop boxes were available 24-7. And there can only be one drop box for every 100,000 voters in a county. The timeline for requesting and returning ballots has also shortened under the new law. Previously, voters could request a ballot 180 days out from an election. Now they can request them 78 days before an election. Ballot applications must be received by the clerk no later than 11 days prior to the election — earlier than the previous deadline. State government officials will not be able to send unsolicited ballot request forms to voters. Only voters who request absentee ballots will receive them. Third parties can still send out ballot request forms, but the front of those forms must be marked: ""This is NOT an official government publication and was NOT provided to you by any governmental entity and this is NOT a ballot."" One of the most contentious provisions is Georgia's ban on giving voters food or water while they're in line at the polls. During the primary last June, precincts around the state were plagued by hours-long lines , and voting rights groups were quick to point out that the late spring and summer heat make the ban on distributing food and water especially onerous. Volunteers and third-party groups regularly hand out water on hot days or hot drinks on cold days to voters standing in line. Georgia had already outlawed campaigns or other groups from distributing or displaying any campaign material within 150 feet of a polling place or within 25 feet of any voters standing in line for a polling site, and the new law now bans  giving voters any gifts, ""including but not limited to, food and drink."" Gabriel Sterling, one of the top officials at the Georgia secretary of state's office, told CBS affiliate WMAZ that the ban is meant to prevent groups from using food and water to campaign within the restricted areas. The law provides an exception to allow poll workers to set up ""self-service water"" so people waiting in line can stay hydrated. Georgia's new law makes a few changes to in-person voting, including efforts to mitigate long lines and changing the rules around provisional ballots. If a voter goes to the wrong precinct in his or her county before 5 p.m., poll workers are supposed to direct that person to the correct precinct, rather than directing the voter to cast a provisional ballot. After 5 p.m., a voter arriving at the wrong polling site may cast a provisional ballot if unable to reach correct precinct before polls close. In November, about 8,200 provisional ballots were cast because a voter wasn't at his or her correct precinct. Nearly 6,800 of those votes were accepted. Overall, 17,697 provisional ballots were cast in the 2020 general election and 11,781 were accepted. The law also attempts to address long lines, demanding that counties with any precinct with over 2,000 voters in the last election or one that kept voters waiting for over an hour to vote must create an additional precinct or add more resources to reduce wait times. The five-person state election board will no longer be chaired by the secretary of state, who now becomes a ""non voting ex officio member."" GOP Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has been at the center of attacks by fellow Republicans for pushing back against attacks from former President Trump. The chair and board members will be elected by the General Assembly, giving more power to the Republican-controlled state legislature. But no members of the board may serve simultaneously in the state legislature. And while elected by the legislature, the chair is supposed to be non-partisan. The new law prohibits the chair from actively participating in a political party or organization, donating to a political campaign, or running for public office during his or her service and in the two years preceding the term as chair. The state election board has new powers over local election officials. It can, for instance,  suspend county or municipal superintendents based on performance or violation of election board rules, after first conducting a preliminary investigation and hearing. It may then appoint temporary replacements, but it can't suspend more than four officials. CBS News didn't project a winner in the presidential race in Georgia until 10 days after Election Day, partly because it took counties so long to count the massive influx of mail ballots. There are several new provisions in SB 202 that will likely lead to faster results in future elections. Because of the pandemic, the state election board passed an emergency rule in 2020 that enabled election workers to start processing absentee ballots 15 days before Election Day in November and the January runoffs. The new law codifies that change, meaning workers will be able to start processing, but not tabulating, absentee ballots 15 days before Election Day for future elections. County officials will be allowed to start tabulating absentee ballots after 7 a.m. on Election Day, but results can't be reported until polls close. Counties must now report returns from absentee ballots by 5 p.m. the day after Election Day or else they could face an investigation. The new law also requires election officials to post the total number of ballots cast, including  Election Day, early voting and absentee ballots, by 10 p.m. on Election Day. The intent is to provide a clearer picture of how many votes were cast early in the counting process. Under the new law, election workers will not be able to stop counting ballots once they've started, so that they can produce faster results. With the new procedures comes a shorter timeline for counties to certify results: six days, rather than 10. The new law allows the Georgia attorney general to set up a hotline for voters to file complaints and allegations of voter intimidation or illegal activity. Georgians may also call anonymously. The attorney general is able to review each allegation to determine if it should be investigated or prosecuted. Separately, a provision in SB 202 allows a voter to make unlimited challenges to another voter's qualifications to cast a ballot. Leading up to the 2020 election runoffs, True the Vote, a conservative group, challenged the eligibility of 360,000 voters, but courts blocked the effort. Allowing voters to make unlimited challenges may bog down election officials and could make it difficult for voters to prove they are eligible when they may have done nothing wrong. The state board of elections could establish procedures designed to make sure that illegitimate challenges don't place a burden on legitimate voters. Following Georgia's high-profile Senate runoffs, which delivered Senate control to Democrats, the state is changing its runoff process. The law still requires a candidate to win a majority of votes to avoid a runoff, but SB 202 abbreviates the runoff period. Previously, nine weeks separated the general election from the runoff, but the new law now requires a runoff to be held 28 days after the election. The law says early voting should start ""as soon as possible"" before a runoff, but only requires early voting to be held on Monday through Friday. Some counties may not offer weekend early voting during runoff elections, depending how long it takes to finish work from the previous election. Because of the shorter period before a runoff election, military and overseas voters will have ranked-choice voting on their general election or primary ballots."
cbs|"Georgia has been Ground Zero in the post-2020 battle over state election laws, but it is hardly the only big battleground state pushing voting changes. Arizona, Florida and Texas are considered the next frontier for altering the way people vote, with their legislatures considering proposals for additional ID requirements, restrictions on dropboxes, and cuts to private funding for local election offices. The three states each have growing and increasingly diverse populations and play a substantial role in the outcome of presidential contests. And they all have Republican governors and Republican majorities in the legislature. But the political trends and the way they conduct elections differ. Donald Trump and local Republicans were successful in Texas last year, and the state already has some of the most restrictive voting laws in the country. Arizona is an emerging battleground and there, Joe Biden eked out a rare victory for Democrats. Florida, a state Mr. Trump also carried, made headlines last year because its election went so smoothly. The common theme across these states when it comes to their proposed changes reflects the national party's emphasis on elections. ""Much of the election reform that's being considered right now is based on a fantasy — a lie — the big lie,"" said David Becker, executive director and founder of the Center for Election Innovation & Research. ""Much of this reform is not necessary, by any means. The security of the election was remarkably good."" The Brennan Center, which has been tracking voting law proposals across the country , found that lawmakers in 47 states have introduced 361 bills that would restrict voting access. Of those restrictive bills, at least 55 are currently moving through legislatures in 24 states. So far, 29 of them have passed one chamber, while 26 of them have made it through a committee vote. Overall, five bills have been signed into law, including Georgia's last week. The final bill signed into law in Georgia was a diluted version of the original proposals. While it included new restrictions, it also expanded early voting in the state. And the voter identification requirement for absentee ballots, rather than just a signature, could make processing easier on election officials and lead to the rejection of fewer ballots. Here are the upcoming states to watch on the voting laws front: Arizona is considering a tightening of its election laws. Most of its voters have been mailing in their votes for years, since the state started allowing mail-in voting for every registered voter 30 years ago. One of the two main bills that has passed the state Senate since the 2020 election, SB 1485 , could shrink the voter pool by getting rid of the permanent early voting list, which allows voters to automatically receive a mail ballot for every election they are eligible to vote in. If voters choose not to vote early in the primary and general election for two consecutive cycles, they risk being removed from the early voter list. Counties are supposed to notify these voters, who may then stay on the list by responding within 30 days. A previous version of the bill failed in the Senate when a Repubilcan voted against the bill, claiming he had misunderstood its provisions , but he supported SB 1485. The other bill to watch is SB 1713 , which adds an ID requirement for people voting absentee. Arizona verifies absentee ballots using a signature match, but this bill would require voters to provide a number from a driver's license, state ID, tribal ID or their voter registration number, in addition to providing a signature when returning an absentee ballot. Florida was a bright spot in an election season marred by COVID-related delays. The state had a no-excuse absentee ballot program long before the pandemic, and until the 2020 election, Republicans had outpaced Democrats in mail-in voting. The state also had rules in place to process ballots before Election Day, so officials were able to report results on Election Night. After working for years to repair its reputation after the 2000 election, Florida stood out as a model in 2020. A record number of voters participated,  Mr. Trump carried the state, and Republicans picked up House seats. Even so, Florida Republicans are pushing for voting restrictions. The legislature is considering Senate Bill 90 , focused on absentee voting. The legislation would prohibit the use of drop boxes altogether — a popular method of returning mail-in ballots — and would require voters to include a form of identification with a mail ballot in addition to a signature. The bill would prohibit anyone but an immediate family member from returning an absentee ballot. And it would require that voters who request an absentee ballot application reapply each election cycle, instead of every two cycles as is current policy. Republican Governor Ron DeSantis has also advocated for these reforms, saying that while the election ran smoothly in Florida, ""we should not rest on our laurels."" During a committee hearing last month, Senator Dennis Baxley, who sponsored the bill under consideration, said ""It's not that there was a debacle so we have to fix it. But do we have to wait for a debacle?"" But Lake County Supervisor Alan Hays, a former Republican lawmaker, called the legislation a ""travesty,"" saying legislators are playing ""havoc with the lives of 1.5 million Floridians, not to mention the burden you've added to the lives of supervisors of election."" Republican state senators in Michigan introduced more than three dozen election bills last week that cover a range of voting issues. There are two bills that would add a photo ID requirement: one that covers absentee voting and one for in-person voting . Currently,  voters without an ID can sign an affidavit affirming their identity, but the new bills would require them to cast a provisional ballot and to verify their identity. There are also other bills that require approval for drop boxes and locking them at 5 p.m . the day before an election, allowing poll watchers to record vote tabulating , and banning the secretary of state from sending unsolicited absentee ballot applications or posting the application on the state's website. ""The reforms introduced today seek to make Michigan's elections more secure, more accurate and trustworthy, while at the same time streamlining participation in the elections process,""  GOP state Senator Lana Theis said in a press release last week. There are also bills that would allow 16-to 17- and-a-half-year-olds to pre-register to vote and would establish early in-person voting on the second Saturday before an election. Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer could veto any bills she views as too restrictive, but Republicans in Michigan have a workaround. If Whitmer vetoes a slate of bills that the legislature passes, the GOP can start a petition initiative. If they gather about 340,000 signatures, the legislature can vote on the petition initiative and a simple majority can approve it without the governor's signature. ""If that legislation is not passed by our legislature, which I'm sure it will be, but if it's not signed by the governor then we have other plans to make sure it becomes law before 2022,"" Michigan GOP Chair Ron Weiser told party activists last week. ""That plan includes taking that legislation and getting the signatures necessary for a legislative initiative so it could become law without Gretchen Whitmer's signature."" Joe Biden won New Hampshire by seven points, but Republicans flipped the state house and senate and kept the governor's mansion. When it comes to voting laws, the state House is considering proposals that would eliminate Election Day voter registration, and would prohibit students from using their educational institution as a place of domicile for the purpose of voting. New Hampshire has the highest number of students per general population — about 11% of the state's population, according to a 2017 study. Lawmakers in Texas are considering multiple bills that would restrict voting access in what is already one of the hardest states to vote in. A study published last year found that Texas had the most restrictive voting processes in 2020. On Thursday, the state Senate passed SB 7 , a sweeping bill that would add many voting restrictions. Texas state Senator Bryan Hughes said Wednesday during a floor debate that the legislation standardizes election rules so that ""every Texan has a fair and equal opportunity to vote, regardless of where they live in the state."" Part of the bill targets two practices used by Harris County, home to Houston, during the 2020 election. It limits early voting hours to 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. after the county offered extended hours in 2020 and had a few 24-hour voting days. It also bans drive-through voting, which was added due to the pandemic and faced a late legal challenge. An analysis by the Texas Civil Rights Project  estimated that Asian, Black and Hispanic voters cast more than half of the votes at drive-thru voting sites and during extended early hours in Harris County. The bill bans county officials from sending absentee ballot applications even to voters who qualify for the process. It requires that a mail ballot be delivered to a person, effectively prohibiting the use of unstaffed drop boxes for returning mail ballots. Voters who request a mail ballot, but choose not to return it, would only be able to vote a provisional ballot. There's a requirement for people who assist voters or drive at least three voters to the polls to fill out a form providing their personal information and reason for assistance. The bill would also create strict rules for how the counties with at least one million people could distribute polling places. It also allows partisan poll watchers to record voters, including those who are receiving assistance while voting if the watcher ""reasonably believes"" that assistance is unlawful. ""It is potentially very intimidating to allow for partisan observers to record voters as they are exercising their franchise,"" Becker said. There's also a bill in the House, HB6 , that provides protections for partisan poll watchers by limiting the reasons a watcher can be removed from a polling site. It also requires people who assist voters to fill out a form and provide ""the reason assistance was necessary."" The bill also makes it a felony for a public official to distribute an absentee application to a voter who didn't request one."
npr|"Georgia's controversial voting law has been the subject of criticism and backlash. It's also shaping the political landscape for statewide elections that are set to take place next year. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: We wanted to follow up on a major story that dominated our attention last month. We're talking about that sweeping 98-page voting law that drastically alters how elections will be run in Georgia. It was signed by Republican Governor Brian Kemp at the end of March after it was passed by the GOP-controlled legislature. Backlash to the law, which was called the Election Integrity Act of 2021, has been intense. Major League Baseball moved the All-Star Game out of the state. Some A-list entertainers said they were suspending projects there. Voting rights groups are filing federal lawsuits, and some have called for boycotts of Georgia-based companies like Home Depot. But there's also been a backlash to the backlash, with conservatives railing against and vowing consequences for corporations that criticized the new law. We wanted to talk about all of that with Georgia Public Broadcasting's Stephen Fowler, who has been tracking voting issues for us. And he is with us now. Stephen, welcome. Thanks for joining us. STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: If you would, just start by reminding us about some of the provisions in the bill - and I'm saying some because it's a massive bill - some of the more controversial provisions, and then bring us up to speed on some of the events since the bill was signed. FOWLER: Right. The law touches virtually every part of how we do elections in Georgia. So there have been at least five federal lawsuits filed to block different pieces, including new ID requirements to vote by mail, narrowing the window you can request a mail-in ballot, adding early voting days for some elections and removing them for runoffs and much, much more. Those suits are all pending and will take a while. Meanwhile, there have been these dueling perspectives on boycotts of the state. On the one hand, Democratic leaders like Stacey Abrams have said boycotts would punish working Georgians who didn't have a role in passing the law and would be unhelpful. But others have made calls to boycott the state's large companies that have not been forceful enough in denouncing parts of the law, this law that has been painted as, quote, ""Jim Crow 2.0"" that will make it harder for nonwhite Georgians to cast their ballot. MARTIN: Now, we mentioned Major League Baseball's decision to move the All-Star Game away from Atlanta, to move it to Colorado. What's the latest on how corporations have been responding to this push to publicly take a stance on voting rights in general and in particular this law? FOWLER: Well, the most visible corporate response has been the one by Major League Baseball, but there have been things for sure. A handful of film and TV productions, for example, have made a point to say they're pulling out of Georgia or not going to consider them for future opportunities. Atlanta is home to a lot of Fortune 500 companies as well, including home-grown businesses, like Coca-Cola, Delta and Home Depot. Well, Coke and Delta leaders spoke out against this law, calling it unacceptable. Others have remained more neutral. And a coalition of Black clergy have called for a boycott of Home Depot because of their rather tepid response. Then there's companies like Patagonia, which is not a Georgia company. And they're giving a million dollars to Georgia voting rights groups to counteract this legislation. MARTIN: And can I ask you about the backlash to the backlash? I mean, you've heard rumblings in Congress about trying to revoke Major League Baseball's antitrust protections and things of that sort. I mean, you've heard some sort of petty things, like people demanding that Coca-Cola be removed from their office suites and things of that sort. But has there been any sort of significant counter move against the opposition to the bill? FOWLER: Absolutely, you know? In the waning days of Georgia's legislative session, when some of these big companies made their statements, like Coke and Delta, the Georgia State House, which is controlled by Republicans, passed sort of a shot across the bow that they were going to remove a jet fuel tax break that Delta enjoyed that ultimately didn't go anywhere but sent a message. And the House speaker talked about how he drank a Pepsi for the first time just to see how it tasted as kind of this spiteful move. But you do see some sort of backlash to the backlash, like you said, coming with members of Congress exploring ways to punish Major League Baseball, punish Delta, punish Coca-Cola, punish these businesses that have kind of now spoken out in favor of voting rights. MARTIN: And so Georgia has been a traditionally Republican state that narrowly flipped last November, you know, electing two Democrats to the United States Senate. Next year, there will be a statewide election with the governor, the secretary of state and Senator Raphael Warnock among those on the ballot. So is this new voting law shaping - or how is it shaping next year's races? FOWLER: Well, Michel, it's dominating discussions. And, honestly, both parties are benefiting from the national attention, and they're crafting their messages around this bill. Democrats point to Georgia's long history of blatantly racist voting laws, saying this is the latest example of leadership that wants to keep Black people from voting. And it's expected Stacey Abrams, who spent the last three years fighting for expanded voter access across the country, will run for governor again with this as the centerpiece of her platform. Now, Republicans, who are reeling from these losses in November and January, are using this law as a rallying cry to get the base excited about protecting election integrity. They're railing against the cancer culture of Major League Baseball's decision and these boycotts, this backlash to the backlash. But some local county Republican conventions voted to censure Governor Brian Kemp, Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger for not doing enough to overturn the election to President Trump's favor. So voting elections are definitely driving the conversations here in Georgia for what will definitely be a contentious showdown next year. MARTIN: That is Georgia Public Broadcasting's Stephen Fowler. Stephen, a lot to talk about. Thank you so much. FOWLER: Thank you. Copyright © 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr|"Director Antoine Fuqua and actor Will Smith, who together are producing the upcoming 1860s-set film Emancipation , announced Monday that they are moving the film's production out of Georgia due to the state's newly enacted voting laws. In a statement provided to NPR on Monday morning, Fuqua and Smith said: ""At this moment in time, the Nation is coming to terms with its history and is attempting to eliminate vestiges of institutional racism to achieve true racial justice. We cannot in good conscience provide economic support to a government that enacts regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access. The new Georgia voting laws are reminiscent of voting impediments that were passed at the end of Reconstruction to prevent many Americans from voting. Regrettably, we feel compelled to move our film production work from Georgia to another state."" Emancipation , which was scheduled to begin filming in June, is based on the true story of an enslaved man named Peter (played by Smith), who escaped from a Louisiana plantation and joined the Union Army. It set a film festival-buying record in July when Apple won the worldwide rights for some $120 million during the virtual Cannes market. The new Georgia voting laws , signed by Gov. Brian Kemp last month, include limitations on mail-in voting and add new identification requirements, among other changes. Critics say that these measures disproportionately harm communities of color. Major League Baseball has already pulled its All-Star Game from Atlanta and moved it to Colorado in response. Large Georgia-based companies, including Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, have publicly criticized the new laws as well, calling them "" unacceptable ."""
npr|"In January, under pressure from Donald Trump to overturn what he baselessly called a fraudulent election, Brad Raffensperger remained steadfast. The Georgia secretary of state insisted that the 2020 election in the state was fair and secure, and that there had been no evidence of foul play to back up the former president's claims. Now, as he throws his support behind the state's new voting law , Raffensperger apparently sees room for necessary improvement in safeguarding elections. In the face of Democratic and corporate criticism, he joins fellow Republicans, including Gov. Brian Kemp , in defending the measure as an overall boost for election integrity. In an interview this week with NPR's All Things Considered , Raffensperger praised the parts of the law that add new ID requirements for absentee voting, expanded access to early in-person voting, shorter runoff period times and reduced wait times. All four of those changes, he said, ""are positive, solid, measured election reforms."" ""It's really something that is a very broad-based, uniform process and is going to, I think, ensure that we have faster runoffs and making sure we have very objective measures for absentee ballots, for identification of those voters, so that it restores confidence,"" Raffensperger said. The law is drawing backlash from Democrats and voting rights advocates who argue it limits absentee voting and disproportionately harms communities of color. Some of the state's biggest companies, including Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, have criticized the law , while Major League Baseball responded by pulling its All-Star Game from Atlanta. President Biden described the law as ""Jim Crow in the 21st century,"" likening it to the series of tactics once designed to disenfranchise Black people in the South. In the NPR interview, Raffensperger disputed those claims, saying, ""It's extremely unfortunate and distasteful"" that people are casting the law that way. ""If you look at our early voting period, it's expanded now to 17 days mandatory for every county in our state and then optional two days of Sunday voting during the early voting phase,"" he said. Democrats also view the reforms as an unnecessary response to last year's record turnout in which 1.3 million absentee ballots were cast. The election of two Democrats from the state to the U.S. Senate, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, handed their party control of the chamber. Raffensperger sees the new voting law less as hasty post-election retaliation and more as a matter of timing. ""We have a legislative session in Georgia that starts the second week in January,"" he said. ""It seems quickly, but ... any bills that you have, including the budget, are done in that 40-day session."" Raffensperger does have one hang-up with the new law. The measure places a number of limits on his office. It removes the secretary of state as chair of Georgia's State Election Board, allowing the Republican-majority board to take over local election offices temporarily. The secretary, too, can no longer send out absentee ballot applications to all voters, which Raffensperger did last summer. He calls the change to remove him as board chairman as ""shortsighted."" ""I'm an elected official, so whatever decisions I make as state election board chairman, I will be held accountable to the voter. Now you have an unelected board, and that unelected board is not really accountable to anyone but the General Assembly,"" he said. ""You'll never be able to hold someone accountable. Everyone's going to be pointing fingers at each other. So, I didn't support that."" Still, he's optimistic about what he sees as a series of overall improvements. ""Also, for the first time in state law, we have now allowed absentee ballot drop boxes,"" he said. ""So that's another good measure."" Drop boxes weren't used in the state until the 2020 election, when they were introduced as an emergency action during the pandemic. But the new law significantly limits the number of ballot drop boxes compared with last year. Democrats say the shrinkage disproportionately affects urban areas. Fulton County, for example — Georgia's most populous county and home to much of Atlanta — will only have eight drop boxes, down from its 38 boxes in November. But Raffensperger contests that, because that number is based on a rule of one box per 100,000 active registered voters in the county, ""Every county is being treated equally the same."" Becky Sullivan and Justine Kenin produced and edited this interview for broadcast."
npr|"NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with Republican Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger about the new voting law, what it includes and how it affects his job. AILSA CHANG, HOST: Backlash to the new voting law in Georgia keeps on growing. Major League Baseball has announced it will move this summer's All-Star Game away from Atlanta to Denver because of this new law. The CEOs of Delta and Coca-Cola, both headquartered in Atlanta, put out statements criticizing the legislation. Republicans, including Georgia's governor Brian Kemp, are defending their work, saying the new law helps ensure election integrity. But Democrats point out that the new law adds restrictions to voting and creates a path for more partisan control of elections. I'm joined now by one of the supporters of this new law - Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger. Welcome. BRAD RAFFENSPERGER: Thank you. CHANG: So now, Republicans in Georgia say this bill is all about election integrity. And I want to ask you about that because you personally made great efforts to make sure the last two elections were secure, were smooth, even as the former president, Donald Trump, criticized you, pressured you to find votes for him. Why do you think this legislation was necessary even after you insisted personally that the two last elections were fair and secure? RAFFENSPERGER: Well, the number one improvement I see coming out of this bill is that we're moving away from signature match. We've actually been sued by both parties, Democrat and Republican, about signature match. Neither one of them like that process because it is subjective. So we're now moving to the driver's license number and your birthday - day, month, year. Very similar to what they're using in Minnesota, so we're following that model. We think it's a very objective way of moving forward. CHANG: But let me ask you, I mean, it is impossible to ignore the timing of this legislation. It followed an election where two Democrats were elected to the U.S. Senate in Georgia. I mean, how do you address that? RAFFENSPERGER: We have session in Georgia that starts the second week in January. It's a 40-day session. That's it. They're done for the year. So that's really why it followed the election. It just - because this is the year that it was going to happen, then you'd have to wait for another year, another January. And that's why the work was done very - it seems quickly, but when the 40-day session - any bills that you have, including the budget, are done in that 40-day session. CHANG: There are many critics of this law who are comparing it to voting laws from the Jim Crow era, which were on their face not targeted at any specific group of people, but ultimately did disenfranchise Black voters, even some white voters who didn't support the party in power. What is your response to that - that this law conjures up the Jim Crow era for many people out there? RAFFENSPERGER: It's extremely unfortunate and distasteful that people would do that. If you look at our early voting period, it's expanded now to 17 days mandatory for every county, you know, in our state, and then optional two days of Sunday voting during the early voting phase. So we could have up to 19 days for any country that wants to do Sunday voting. That's more than we've had before. It used to be 16 days of mandatory voting. We've also worked on making sure we have short lines, so a maximum of one hour maximum wait time. In the November election, the wait time averaged - in the afternoon - was about two minutes. And so we've already made great improvement. Now, we want to put that into law. That's a good thing. And for the first time ever, we've gone to ranked-choice voting for runoffs. We had an eight-week runoff, and now we'll be able to shorten that to a four-week runoff for federal elections. And that's another good measure. So all four of those measures that I've talked about are positive, you know, solid, measured election reforms. CHANG: What I don't understand is that you do support this law despite the fact that it does place a number of limits on your office specifically. For example, it removes you as the head of the state election board. It replaces you with an independent chair appointed by the Republican legislature. Also, the secretary of state, under this law, can no longer send out absentee ballot applications to all voters, which you did last summer. I mean, do any of these constraints on your powers as secretary of state concern you? RAFFENSPERGER: Well, I don't agree with the policy that would remove me as being chairman of the state election board, and I've been very clear on that matter. I'm an elected official, so whatever decisions I make as state election board chairman, I will be held accountable to the voter. Now you have an unelected board, and that unelected board is not really accountable to anyone but the General Assembly. So the accountability is very diffused. You'll never be able to hold someone accountable. Everyone's going to be pointing fingers at each other. So I didn't support that. It's shortsighted. I said that much. And it's petulant, and I feel it's a dumb move. But other than that... CHANG: Well, is there any part of you that has a sense that that particular provision - the one that removes you as the head of the state election board - that that was in part retaliation for you speaking out against the former president? RAFFENSPERGER: Well, that's what our speaker has so stated, and he's quoted in the press as saying. But you have to look in total. I think that when you have a verifiable driver's license, that's a good thing. When you have early voting that's expanded, that's a good thing - one hour maximum wait time. Also for the first time in state law, we have now allowed absentee ballot drop boxes. So that's another good measure. CHANG: But many of the provisions in this bill will disproportionately affect urban areas. Obviously, these are areas that are largely democratic. Why is that a good thing? RAFFENSPERGER: I don't believe that's the case at all. I believe that it's really working and striving to make sure that there's uniformity as much as you can have in a state with 159 counties, with the smallest county having 2,500 people and the largest county having, you know, basically a million people. So it's really something that is very broad-based, uniform process and is going to, I think, ensure that we have faster runoffs and making sure we have very objective measures for absentee ballots, for identification of those voters so that it restores confidence. CHANG: I want to talk specifically about Fulton County. That's home to the city of Atlanta. They had 38 drop boxes last November, but under this new law, the county says they will only have eight drop boxes. You say there won't be a disproportionate impact on urban areas, but how do you explain that? RAFFENSPERGER: It's because it's based on one drop box for every hundred thousand registered voters. So every county is being treated equally the same. CHANG: Fulton County would disagree. RAFFENSPERGER: Well, I understand that. And some of the other even smaller counties would like to have seen an absentee ballot drop box at every one of the early voting locations. And that's perhaps something that the General Assembly would consider in the next year's session. CHANG: Secretary of State of Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, thank you very much for joining us today.

npr|"Major League Baseball changed the location of the game from Georgia to Colorado. That's puts a state with a history of expansive voting access in the spotlight, after Georgia passed restrictive laws. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Major League Baseball moved its All-Star Game from Atlanta to Denver. That move came in protest against Georgia's new law that limits access to voting for many people. Republicans favor new voter restrictions after losing the 2020 election. And they have now responded to Major League Baseball with a new disinformation campaign. They've said Colorado's voter laws are just as restrictive as Georgia's. In reality, Colorado voting laws are among the most inclusive in the country. Here's Andrew Kenney of Colorado Public Radio. ANDREW KENNEY, BYLINE: Major League Baseball said that they chose Colorado as the new site of the All-Star game for purely logistical reasons. The Colorado Rockies already had a strong plan for hotels and events and security. But it was hard to ignore the politics of it. Georgia's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, said that if the standard was the election system, moving the game to Colorado was hypocritical. He made the point on Fox News that Georgia has 17 days of in-person early voting. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRIAN KEMP: Including two optional Sundays. Colorado has 15 is what I'm being told. They also have a photo ID requirement. So doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. KENNEY: Colorado does not require a photo ID. Kemp was correct that Colorado has fewer days for voters to physically show up at the polls. But since the state started mailing all voters ballots in 2014, most people here don't vote in person. HILLARY HALL: Ninety-five percent of our voters will use a mail ballot. KENNEY: Hillary Hall is the former clerk of Boulder County and is now a vote by mail advocate with the National Vote At Home Institute. She says that when people do go to the polls, it's often because they didn't get a ballot at home or simply personal preference. HALL: In our state, early voting is really the safety net to allow people who aren't already registered or who have moved or any of those sorts of things to participate through early voting. KENNEY: Colorado is one of a few states that mails out ballots to every registered voter weeks ahead of time. Voters can then mail them back or drop them in one of hundreds of official 24-hour drop boxes. Georgia's new law, on the other hand, will make it harder to vote by absentee mail ballot. A New York Times analysis found the new law is set to cut the number of drop boxes around Atlanta by some 75%. Colorado election leaders say the differences between the two systems are evident. While Georgia is known for hours-long voting lines, Colorado is second in the nation for turnout. Colorado's Secretary of State Jena Griswold says the All-Star game is another chance to celebrate how her state votes. JENA GRISWOLD: So I think it's really exciting, of course, that we're going to have the All-Star game but also the ability to highlight how elections can be for all American voters. KENNEY: Major League Baseball's All-Star game is scheduled for July 13 in Denver. For NPR News, I'm Andrew Kenney. (SOUNDBITE OF GIANTS' ""JOPLIN, MISSOURI"") Copyright © 2021 NPR.

npr|"When Major League Baseball decided to move the All-Star Game to Denver , it was a moment of celebration for many Colorado politicos. MLB had pulled the game from Atlanta in response to criticism of Georgia's new voting law. The choice of Coors Field as the new site was seen by Colorado lawmakers as another validation of Colorado's reputation for having some of the nation's most accessible and secure elections. But the move quickly met a new conservative talking point: The states aren't that different, Republican lawmakers claimed. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said on Fox News that the change ""doesn't make a whole lot of sense,"" arguing that Colorado has equally restrictive laws. He and others pointed out that Georgia offers voters 17 days of in-person early voting, while Colorado has only 15 of those in-person days. ""So hypocritical,"" Kemp said. Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, posted a similar message on Twitter. Why Colorado has fewer in-person voting days There's a major difference between the states, though: Colorado votes by mail. Every registered voter receives a ballot about 15 to 20 days before the election. And instead of waiting in line at a polling station, the vast majority simply drop the ballot in a mailbox or a secure dropbox. According to information from the secretary of state , 99.3% of Colorado primary voters used one of those methods last year. So, while it's true that Colorado has fewer days for in-person voting, it also has far less demand for in-person voting. Voters rarely encounter lines here. And the ultimate result of Colorado's system is relatively high turnout. Georgia's new law moves the state away from Colorado's vote-by-mail approach, pushing more voters to show up in person. For example, under the new law, Georgia elections officials can only mail out absentee applications to voters who individually request it , shutting down one approach to encouraging mail balloting. And voters will have a shorter window to ask for those ballots. (Georgia sent out absentee applications to millions of voters in the 2020 primary, even if they hadn't requested it , to encourage absentee voting during the pandemic.) The Georgia law also bans mobile voting centers, and it strictly limits the use of dropboxes. This is another area where Colorado is moving in the opposite direction. Colorado had one dropbox per 9,400 active registered voters for the last election, with the secretary of state boasting about adding scores of new locations in the past few years. Georgia has now set a cap of one box per 100,000 active registered voters. The metropolitan Atlanta area could see its number of dropboxes drop from 94 to 23, The New York Times reported. And, instead of being outdoors with 24-hour access, as many in Colorado are, the Georgia boxes must be inside government buildings and voting sites. Meanwhile, Georgia's law adds an additional Saturday of early voting, but it limits the hours of those early voting days to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. How the states' ID requirements compare Kemp and others also have said that Colorado requires photo identification to vote, which is false. Colorado does require some form of ID when voters register for the first time and whenever they vote in person. But the state accepts 16 different forms of identification. The options include common identification cards like a driver's license, U.S. passport or government employee ID — but Colorado also accepts Medicare and Medicaid cards, college IDs, utility bills, bank statements and paychecks. Colorado does not require identification for mail voting once a person is registered. Instead, the state mails a ballot to the person's home, and then matches their signature against a database when the ballot is returned. Georgia allows only six forms of ID for in-person voting . And the state requires that voters provide a driver's license number, a copy of a state identification card or a Social Security number each time they vote by mail. Georgia does allow first-time voters to use documents such as utility bills, bank statements and government documents that show the person's name and address as identification if they were not able to prove residency when they first applied to vote. But that option is only available for the person's first time voting in the state. Water and food for voters The Georgia law's limits on providing food and water near polling sites have become another focus for criticism. After the All-Star Game moved, viral tweets claimed that Colorado has the same restrictions, which is false. In Georgia, the new law bans ""any person"" from distributing food or water within 150 feet of a polling place or within 25 feet of a voter standing in line at a polling place. In Colorado, the state says that ""comfort teams"" may provide food and water, as long as they don't promote a political candidate or cause . Colorado voters are also less likely to need sustenance while waiting to vote, since they rarely encounter lines. Georgia lawmakers have argued that poll workers can still set up water stations. They said the law was supposed to prevent campaigns from trying to influence voters with gifts. A version of this story originally appeared on CPR.org ."
npr|"Major League Baseball's 2021 All-Star Game will be played in Colorado's Coors Field, the league says, after it canceled plans for Atlanta to host baseball's midseason centerpiece. The change came in response to Georgia's controversial new voting law, which the MLB says is against its values. ""Major League Baseball is grateful to the Rockies, the City of Denver and the State of Colorado for their support of this summer's All-Star Game,"" Baseball Commissioner Robert Manfred Jr. said. Georgia's Republican-led overhaul, which supporters say expands some voters' access to early voting, has been widely criticized as hampering access to absentee voting and disproportionately affecting minority communities. The Rockies were seen as a leading contender to host the game, because the team was already vying to host an upcoming All-Star Game. Those preparations, Manfred said, helped land the game in Denver. Before the change of plans, the Atlanta Braves were eagerly anticipating the All-Star Game as a chance to show off their 4-year-old stadium and also to honor Hank Aaron , the legendary Braves hitter who died in January. But those plans were derailed by the controversy over Georgia's new law, which President Biden labeled ""Jim Crow in the 21st century."" Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp recently denounced the MLB move as a figment of ""cancel culture,"" saying the league was swayed by activists. Georgia's Republican-controlled government enacted sweeping changes to voter requirements and election laws several months after the state's voters chose Biden over former President Donald Trump and sent two Democratic senators to Washington, D.C. The new law bans people from providing water to voters waiting in line, and it will allow state officials to take over local election offices, among other changes. Kemp has defended the law , saying it ""expands access to voting, secures ballot drop boxes around the clock in every county, expands weekend voting, protects no-excuse absentee voting. It levels the playing field on voter I.D. requirements as well as streamlining election procedures."" Republicans pushed the changes through despite officials' repeated affirmations that Georgia's recent elections were free of fraud, rebuking theories that  Trump's allies embraced. Some Republicans are now criticizing the MLB's relocation of the All-Star Game – including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who on Monday canceled plans to throw out the first pitch for a Texas Rangers game. ""It is shameful that America's pastime is not only being influenced by partisan political politics, but also perpetuating false political narratives,"" Abbott said in a letter to the Rangers organization. When the MLB took the summertime game away from Atlanta, Manfred, the baseball commissioner, called it ""the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport,"" adding that the league ""fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box."" In response to the MLB move, the Braves said, ""This was neither our decision, nor our recommendation and we are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city."" The team said it values equal voting opportunities. ""Our city has always been known as a uniter in divided times and we will miss the opportunity to address issues that are important to our community,"" it said. Critics of the Georgia law include executives at some of the state's best-known companies, such as the Coca-Cola Co. and Delta Air Lines . But other big companies with Georgia headquarters have remained silent, according to  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution . Manfred said the MLB still plans to commemorate Aaron at the July game in Denver. The league will also move ahead with plans to invest in communities in Atlanta, the commissioner said. The 2022 All-Star Game will be hosted by the Los Angeles Dodgers, which had been poised to host the game last year before the COVID-19 pandemic derailed those plans."
npr|"After Major League Baseball announced Friday it was moving the All Star Game out of Atlanta, reaction has been swift. MLB said it opposes the new Georgia law that restricts some voting rights. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: How far should private companies go if they disapprove of a voting law in Georgia? Some big national brands based in Georgia have already questioned that new law. Now Coke and Delta face boycotts for not doing more, as does the Home Depot. Major League Baseball has already said it will move this year's All-Star Game out of Atlanta. Prominent Black church and community leaders criticized a series of measures that Georgia Republicans passed after their side lost the 2020 election. Under fierce criticism, Republicans modified a plan to eliminate Sunday voting, which is commonly used by Black voters. But the law still does reduce early voting in urban areas and bans giving water to people standing in line to vote. It also strips much power from Brad Raffensperger, the Republican official who last year resisted efforts to overturn a Democratic election. Emil Moffatt begins our coverage. He's with our member station WABE. Good morning. EMIL MOFFATT, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. Good morning. INSKEEP: Before we talk about this boycott, I do want to note that Delta has already said that the new laws are unacceptable from Delta's point of view. Coca-Cola said it was disappointed with the legislation. What more are the companies expected to do? MOFFATT: Yeah, they want these companies to support the lawsuits against these laws, to hold press conferences to denounce these and similar proposed voting laws across the country. And they want the companies to use their national clout, their national influence to push for voting rights protection at the federal level. Here's Bishop Reginald Jackson with the Georgia AME Church. REGINALD JACKSON: We need them to speak out against any effort to suppress votes, any effort that is racist and any effort to turn back time. MOFFATT: And Bishop Jackson says he continues to meet with these corporate leaders hoping to stave off the boycott, but he still wants commitments from them. INSKEEP: I just - I guess we should just remember that these voting law changes grow out of a lie - the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen. This is something that Governor Brian Kemp knows is untrue. He actually defended the legal results during the 2020 election but now signed this law and supports the law. How is he defending his course? MOFFATT: Yeah, he says the laws need updating regardless of whatever may or may not have happened during the 2020 elections, especially, he says, after so much change because the pandemic. But Kemp went on to accuse Major League Baseball of basically just taking its cues from prominent Democrats. He said what baseball is doing is a continuation of what he calls cancel culture that targets conservatives. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRIAN KEMP: What sport are they going after now? What event are they going to go after? What convention? What are they going to do if the Braves make the playoffs? Are they going to move the damn playoff game? MOFFATT: And Kemp claims the new laws actually expand access to voting and make elections more secure. We should note that some of the measures do expand voting opportunities, but that's mainly in smaller counties. In large areas like metro Atlanta, the laws either keep the status quo or reduce access. And already several lawsuits have been filed against these new laws. Georgia's Republican attorney general, Chris Carr, will have to defend the state. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHRIS CARR: Anybody who actually reads this bill quickly sees that it strengthens security, expands access and improves transparency in Georgia's elections. MOFFATT: And Carr, like Kemp, accused President Biden and Stacey Abrams of using misinformation to pressure companies against this bill. INSKEEP: Emil, thanks so much, really appreciate your reporting. MOFFATT: You're welcome. INSKEEP: Emil Moffatt with member station WABE in Atlanta. Copyright © 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr|"Black religious and community leaders in Georgia are protesting new restrictive voting changes by calling for a boycott of Georgia's most prominent businesses if they don't help to force change. LEILA FADEL, HOST: Major League Baseball has announced it will pull the All-Star Game and the league's draft out of Atlanta in response to Georgia's newly passed voting laws. Other iconic name brands in the state - Coca-Cola, Delta and Home Depot - are facing pressure to more forcefully oppose the measures, measures that progressive groups call restrictive and a throwback to the Jim Crow era. As Emil Moffatt of member station WABE in Atlanta reports, companies that have spoken out in the past week have already gotten pushback from some of their strongest allies - pro-business Republicans. EMIL MOFFATT, BYLINE: When Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signed Senate Bill 202 into law, it represented the culmination of a bitter months-long fight at the state Capitol over the future of voting in the state. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRIAN KEMP: And contrary to the hyper-partisan rhetoric you may have heard inside and outside this gold dome, the facts are that this new law will expand voting access in the peach state. MOFFATT: While the legislation does add another mandatory Saturday of early voting, most larger counties were already offering those days. And voting rights advocates say there's a lot more not to like about the 98-page bill, such as reducing access to absentee ballot drop boxes, requiring more identification to get a mail-in ballot and giving the Republican-controlled legislature more power over the state election board, which certifies election results. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: Keep your hands... UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: Keep your hands... UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: ...Off our votes. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: ...Off our votes. KEMP: Despite daily protest outside the state Capitol against Republican-backed voting bills, prominent Georgia-based companies held their strongest statements until after the legislation was signed into law. Coca-Cola said it was disappointed with the outcome. Delta called the bill unacceptable and said it will, quote, ""make it harder for many underrepresented voters, particularly Black voters, to exercise their constitutional right."" In response, the speaker of the Georgia House, Republican David Ralston, cracked open a Pepsi for the first time in years. He also had pointed words for the airline. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVID RALSTON: You know, Delta had been at the table in discussions on the bill. They were a part of a dialogue that we had actually going on for several weeks. And so the statement today kind of came out of the blue. MOFFATT: That same day, Republicans in the Georgia House made a last-minute bid to reimpose the tax on jet fuel, a break that saves Delta tens of millions per year. But the state Senate adjourned without taking it up. For voting rights activists like Bishop Reginald Jackson of Georgia's AME Church, the most recent statements from Delta and Coca-Cola are too little, too late. Outside the World of Coca-Cola Museum in downtown Atlanta, he called for a boycott against the companies and Home Depot starting Wednesday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) REGINALD JACKSON: We will not give them our money. We will learn to like some other drinks. We will learn to go to some other stores. We will learn to fly on some other airline. But we're not going to support these corporations. MOFFATT: Jackson says he will continue to talk with leaders from these companies. And while he acknowledges the recent statements from Coke and Delta, he says these powerful Georgia-based companies had the influence to change lawmakers' minds before the bill was passed but didn't. JACKSON: Now, I suspect that the reason they spoke out was because of this press conference announcing the boycott. If it wasn't for the boycott, I'm not sure they would have spoken out. MOFFATT: Not only is Bishop Jackson calling for a reversal of the new voting laws in Georgia, but for these companies to use their national clout to help pass federal legislation to protect voting rights across the U.S. In a statement Friday, Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said moving the All-Star Game out of Georgia was, quote, ""the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport."" Fair access to voting, Manfred said, continues to have our game's unwavering support. For NPR News, I'm Emil Moffitt in Atlanta. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr|"Major League Baseball is pulling its All-Star game from Georgia in response to voting rights restrictions recently passed there. SCOTT SIMON, HOST: And now it's time for sports. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: Major League Baseball says Truist Park might as well book a demolition derby 'cause they're not going to bring the All-Star Game there in July. And the women's NCAA championship game set for tomorrow, Arizona versus Stanford - men's Final Four is tonight. ESPN's Howard Bryant joins us. Howard, thanks so much for being with us. HOWARD BRYANT, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. How are you? SIMON: Fine, thank you. You and I were on a Zoom call, my friend, yesterday when we got the news that Major League Baseball is pulling the All-Star Game out of Georgia. This is a big step, isn't it? BRYANT: Yeah, it's a big deal. And it's obviously caused a great deal of consternation. But I think that what we're looking at here - I think there were two things that really jumped out at me. One is that this was not a player-driven movement. This was something that Major League Baseball and its corporate sponsors and the powers that be at the top of the game decided that this was bad for business. And I think that this was something that really does go back - to me, I think it really does go back to the election. It goes back to January 6. It goes back to the fact that I think people want to turn the temperature down on the rhetoric and the narrative of election fraud. And I think Major League Baseball just realized that this was not the place to do this. This was not the right venue for the All-Star Game. And I think that what was really interesting is that we've been here before. We've - we remember 2017 in North Carolina with the so-called bathroom bill. If you go back into the '80s when there was pressure on the state of Arizona to turn MLK Day into a national holiday, and the Super Bowl was threatened back in '87. So we remember that these things have happened, even if you go back into the 1960s as well and beyond that. So it's going to be a difficult thing for people to handle in Georgia. And we don't really know who has been really helped by it necessarily because a lot of poor... SIMON: Oh, yeah. BRYANT: ...Working poor folks who are affected by the bill are going to be hurt by this by not having the business there as well. So this is a tough spot for everybody involved. SIMON: Let's - women's NCAA finals are set now. Arizona Wildcats beat UConn decisively by 10 points. Stanford eked out a single-digit win over South Carolina - kind of heartbreaking for South Carolina. What do you foresee in the finals? BRYANT: Well, I don't like to make predictions, Scott Simon. You know that. However... SIMON: I ask just what do you see, yeah. BRYANT: (Laughter) What do I see? Yeah, I see Stanford really close to finishing the job. I think they've been the best team all season. And I think they're really, really close to showing it. However, I think that in having an all-Pac-10 - Pac-10, I'm dating myself - Pac-12 final, you really never know. It's hard to beat a team three times in a season. And I think that... SIMON: Yeah. BRYANT: ...Arizona, they really put it on (laughter) UConn. So I think that if they can handle, let's call it, that underdog mentality that they really showed last night, then it's going to be a great game. But I do think that there is a significant difference right now between Stanford and Arizona. SIMON: On the men's side, Final Four, we have UCLA versus Gonzaga, Houston versus Baylor tonight. What do you foresee there, Howard Bryant? BRYANT: What do I foresee there? You know, what I will tell you - one thing, Scott - what I foresee is that - what a year it's been in terms of basketball from the Midwest out to the West Coast. You've got a Final Four that is, essentially, the West Coast and Texas - you know, Houston... SIMON: Yeah, that's right. BRYANT: ...Baylor. Then you've got Gonzaga, and you've got UCLA. And so it's really been this way for almost - early through the tournament, where you've got these - it's been a regional thing. But I kind of think - Gonzaga as well, they've been really close. They've been the best team all season as well. UCLA is the... SIMON: Right. BRYANT: ...Sentimental team. And it's nice to see Houston there. We haven't seen them there since the Phi Slama Jama days in the '80s. SIMON: Yeah. BRYANT: So I am going to say, let's enjoy. But if we stick with the No. 1 teams, I think Stanford was the best team before on the women's side, and I think Gonzaga's been the best team all season on the men. SIMON: Howard Bryant, thanks so much. BRYANT: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

politico|"Georgia has delayed its presidential primary due to coronavirus. The primary, which was originally scheduled for March 24, will now be held on May 19. Georgia is the second state to delay its presidential primary. Louisiana rescheduled its April 4 primary to June 20 on Friday. The virus, which has infected more than 2,700 people across the United States, has prompted school closures, the cessation of professional sports and, in many places, a prohibition on large public gatherings. ""Events are moving rapidly and my highest priority is protecting the health of our poll workers, their families, and the community at large,"" Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in a statement, originally issued to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution . The presidential primary in the state will now be held on the same day as primaries in the state for local, state and congressional offices. In-person early voting has also been halted.  A statement from state Sen. Nikema Williams, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Georgia, indicated that in-person and absentee ballots that have already been cast in the presidential primary will count. However, election officials in four states that are voting on Tuesday — Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio — said on Friday their primaries will go on as scheduled. ""Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past, and based on the best information we have from public health officials, we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election, and that otherwise healthy poll workers can and should carry out their patriotic duties on Tuesday,"" a joint statement from top election officials read. After Tuesday, only one other state or territory has a presidential primary scheduled for the month of March: Puerto Rico. But party officials in the state have also requested the primary be moved. A statement from the Puerto Rico Democratic Party said Chairman Charles Rodriguez requested that the territory""s legislature postpone its primary until April 26, with the potential for the primary to be held later if the virus is still not contained. Some election watchdogs fret that delaying primaries is a step too far, expressing worry that moving primaries could effectively suppress voters"" rights. ""We all agree that the safety and health of the public is paramount, but steps can, and must be taken to protect voters and poll workers while also ensuring that the democratic process marches ahead,"" read a joint statement issued after Louisiana's decision from dozens of groups, including The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the NAACP. ""Sudden changes to election times, locations, and more have been proven to create barriers to, and in some instances the denial of, citizens their right to vote."" Election administrators in the four states voting on Tuesday have been scrambling to minimize risk to voters and poll workers. Polling sites in high-risk places like nursing homes have been moved, and officials are instructing poll workers to routinely clean and disinfect voting areas. Voters have also been strongly encouraged to take advantage of early and mail-in voting as much as possible. However, early, mail, and absentee voting laws vary widely state-by-state. Some states — like Washington, which voted earlier this week — allow for expansive mail voting, limiting the amount of disruption the outbreak can cause for an election. But others only allow absentee votes with a valid excuse and have limited (or no) early voting, adding a barrier for some voters that likely cannot be lifted without legislative action from state lawmakers or executives. Elected officials and activists have started pushing for states to have more expansive absentee and mail-in voting in later primary states and for the general election, as fears over the long term effects of the virus"" spread builds.

politico|"Congressional Democrats and minority groups assailed Monday""s Supreme Court decision upholding Indiana""s photo-ID law as an affront to voting rights, but political realities in the states suggest that the ruling could have relatively limited impact nationwide. Only three states — Indiana, Florida and Georgia — currently require voters to show government-issued photo IDs before stepping into the voting booth. Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas are considering similar requirements, but it""s not clear whether they can adopt them before the November elections. Democratic insiders fear that a number of states, particularly in the Midwest and South, will copy the Indiana law now that the Supreme Court has upheld it. ""There""s the concern for our side that it can spread, other states can do what Indiana did,"" said a Democratic strategist. ""You may see a lot more of this now."" But Neil Bradley, director of the Voting Rights Project for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that only states with both Republican-controlled legislatures and Republican governors have been able to implement photo ID laws, creating a de factor partisan limit on the number of places where such requirements may be imposed. ""That situation doesn""t change by today""s opinion,"" Bradley said. ""So you""re not going to have like 20 states that are going to do it."" In its 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court upheld a 2005 Indiana law requiring photo IDs for voters. Under the law, a voter who shows up at the polls without a photo ID can cast a provisional ballot to be counted only if, within the next 10 days, the voter shows a photo ID to the local county clerk. Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said the decision is ""a body blow to what America stands for — equal access to the polls."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the ruling ""disappointing,"" saying the decision ""places obstacles to the fundamental rights of American citizens—especially the poor, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities—to participate in the electoral process."" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said the majority ""failed to protect access to the ballot box for some of the most vulnerable Americans,"" and argued that the Justice Department, under President Bush, has employed ""the specter of purported ""voter fraud"" for political advantage."" ""They do so at the expense of vulnerable communities and have excluded millions of elderly, low-income, disabled, and minority voters, even though in-person voter fraud has been proven time and time again to be a myth,"" Leahy said. With Indianans heading to the polls on May 6 in a contested Democratic presidential primary, minority groups were particularly outraged by the Supreme Court decision, arguing that huge blocs of voters potentially face disenfranchisement next month and again in the fall because they cannot meet the ID requirements. ""The voting process needs to as unencumbered as possible, and requiring a photo identification disenfranchises those citizens who might otherwise never have a need for identification--particularly in rural, poor, and minority communities,"" said Rep. Joe Baca (D-Calif.), chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. ""This is a violation of our voting rights – and a deliberate attack on democracy."" John Payton, president and executive director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, offered a similar concern. ""I think what we know from this opinion, what we can be confident of, is perhaps tens of thousands of eligible African-American voters will not be allowed to vote this year because this law has been upheld. That""s particularly disturbing because this is one of the most important election cycles we""ve ever seen in this country."" Republicans, for their part, were uniformly positive about Monday""s ruling. House Minority Leader John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said the decision will give Americans ""renewed faith in their government""s ability to conduct fair and honest elections."" House Minority Whip Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), whose state saw its photo ID law struck down by a state court, was similarly ebullient. ""By a convincing majority of six-to-three, the Supreme Court today affirmed a principle the American people have overwhelmingly supported for some time: asking citizens to produce a simple form of identification before voting is neither unreasonable nor unconstitutional – and if it helps impede voter fraud, absolutely necessary to ensure the basic integrity of the democratic process,"" Blunt said in a statement. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices John Paul Stevens and Anthony Kennedy said that Indiana""s compelling interest in preventing voter fraud outweighed the burden the law places on voters. Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito said the photo ID requirement was ""minimal and justified"" and called Democratic efforts to overturn the law ""irrelevant."" In their dissent, Justices David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued that the Indiana law ""threatens to impose nontrivial burdens on the voting right of tens of thousands of the state""s citizens,"" a ""significant percentage"" of whom would ""likely"" be deterred from voting. Justice Stephen Breyer said the law ""imposes an unconstitutional burden"" on voters without driver""s licenses or other former of ID. Lawmakers from both parties became personally involved in the case as it wound its way through the federal courts, with Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Reps. Keith Ellison (D-Ind.), Robert Brady (D-Pa.) and Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) filing petitions to overturn it. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who tried to push through a photo ID requirement during a 2006 debate on immigration, filed a brief in support of the law."
politico|"Rep. Doug Collins announced Wednesday he is running for Senate in Georgia, setting up an intraparty battle with appointed Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler in the emerging battleground state. Collins and Loeffler will be running to complete the term of former Sen. Johnny Isakson, who resigned at the end of last year because of health issues. The election is an all-party contest in November, with the top two finishers facing off in a January 2021 runoff if no candidate tops 50 percent of the vote. An ally to President Donald Trump and top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Collins is popular with the GOP base and framed his run around helping the president. ""I want to continue to serve the people of Georgia. We're getting ready for a good time down here to keep defending this president and keep working for the people of Georgia,"" Collins said in an interview on ""Fox and Friends"" Wednesday morning. Collins downplayed concerns about running against a sitting Republican senator. He did not say whether he thought Trump would back his run, but said he appreciated the president's ""help and support"" in the past. ""I think we fought for the president, we fought for our state and we fought for this country,"" Collins said. ""And we're going to continue to do that. I look forward to a good exchange of ideas and look forward to this election."" The bid complicates Republicans path to holding onto the seat in November, which has frustrated allies of Senate GOP leadership. Republicans are defending a 53-47 majority in the chamber — including the other Georgia Senate seat — and an expensive and high-profile fight in the Georgia special election is seen as unhelpful to their cause. Loeffler, a wealthy finance executive, has nearly endless resources to put into her own campaign. She has already pledged to spend at least $20 million on her own bid, a figure that could easily rise in a competitive contest. Her campaign already announced plans to spend $4 million on the airwaves, and $2.6 million has already been booked for ads through mid-February playing up her support of Trump and introducing her biography to voters. Collins will have significant roadblocks to keeping up in the resource battle. He had nearly $1.4 million in cash on hand in his federal campaign account as of last Sept. 30. His next report will be due to the FEC on Friday, which will disclose how much money he had in the bank at the end of last year. Collins was immediately brushed back by Senate Republicans. The top staffer at the NRSC said the GOP's official campaign arm ""stands firmly behind"" Loeffler and said Collins' bid threatens the party's hold on not just the Senate seat — but up and down the entire ballot, including the presidential race. ""The shortsightedness in this decision is stunning,"" Kevin McLaughlin, the executive director of the NRSC, said in a statement. ""Doug Collins"" selfishness will hurt David Perdue , Kelly Loeffler, and President Trump. Not to mention the people of Georgia who stand to bear the burden of it for years to come. All he has done is put two Senate seats, multiple House seats and Georgia""s 16 electoral votes in play."" Collins fired back at the NRSC on Twitter, rejecting claims that his candidacy risked Republicans' position in the election. ""Don't be ridiculous, this is FAKE NEWS coming from the head of a Washington-based group whose bylaws require him to support all incumbents, even unelected ones,"" Collins tweeted in response to the NRSC statement. Republicans were already preparing for battle against Collins as rumors of his impending announcement traveled around the Capitol this week. The NRSC's statement was among the first salvos from the GOP establishment. A super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also criticized Collins for being ""selfish."" Steven Law, the president of the McConnell-linked Senate Leadership Fund, said Loeffler, who was sworn earlier this month, ""is such a warrior for the president."" ""We'll have her back if she needs us,"" Law said. Meanwhile, Loeffler, the newly minted incumbent, was at the White House on Wednesday for the signing of the new North American trade agreement — where she got a shoutout from the president. ""Congratulations, Kelly, really great,"" Trump said. ""They already like you a lot. That's what the word is."" Quint Forgey contributed to this report."

GEORGIA BOYCOTT THREAT GROWS — A growing list of media companies is threatening to stop production of TV shows and films in Georgia if the state moves forward with implementing one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the country, slated to go into effect in January 2020. Netflix and Disney led the pack, followed by AT&T""s WarnerMedia, and, most recently, Comcast""s NBCUniversal, all saying publicly they""re considering pulling out. ""We fully expect that the heartbeat bills and similar laws in various states will face serious legal challenges and will not go into effect while the process proceeds in court,"" NBCUniversal said in a statement on Thursday. ""If any of these laws are upheld, it would strongly impact our decision-making on where we produce our content in the future."" — Similar sentiments: CBS, its subsidiary Showtime, AMC Networks and Viacom have taken softer stances but indicated that they""re tracking the legal developments and might, down the line, re-evaluate their work there should the law take effect. —  The bigger picture: Film and television production has in recent years become a massive industry in Georgia, thanks to tax breaks offered since the 2000s, and the list of companies threatening to pull out of the state represents a large swath of the TV and film industry. It""s a reflection of the polarizing times that corporations, including seemingly staid telecom giants like Comcast and AT&T, are planting their flags on one side of such a divisive issue — and a sign of the economic might that media titans now command following years of consolidation. Still, even the most forceful statements stop short of a full-bore pledge to pull out of Georgia if the courts don""t block the law from taking effect, instead promising to strongly consider leaving the state in that event. PIC DU JOUR — This giant angry emoji inflated outside Facebook""s annual shareholder meeting in Menlo Park, Calif., on Thursday. (H/t Karl Mondon , a photographer for The Mercury News in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area.) Protesters from consumer and civil rights groups, some holding ""break up Facebook"" signs, showed up to demand checks on CEO Mark Zuckerberg""s power after months of data privacy scandals and a rising tide of arguments that Facebook has become unaccountably large. Those concerns made it into a number of shareholder proposals to make changes like installing an independent figure instead of Zuckerberg as chairman of the board and diluting his voting power. All, however, were easily beaten back . — ""The outcome of votes at Facebook are never in doubt, due to Mark Zuckerberg""s 10-1 voting power and ability to single-handedly determine every decision put to shareholders,"" said Brandi Collins-Dexter, senior campaign director for civil rights group Color of Change. ""And that""s exactly the problem: Facebook""s leadership can continue to ignore demands for governance reforms and abdicate responsibility on the problems of safety, privacy, and manipulation the platform has created."" SCOOT OVER? — Uber and Lyft joined scooter-sharing startups Bird and Lime in Washington on Thursday for a policy discussion on the growing e-scooter market, in which all four now operate globally. The panel, hosted by trade group the Consumer Technology Association, touched on the toll the trade war with China is taking on the companies"" scooter-sharing businesses and supply chains, affecting where and how quickly they can deploy. The majority of these e-scooters are manufactured in mainland China, according to Brenden Dooley, who leads federal policy efforts at Uber, ""so there""s 25 percent added on to the price of the scooter,"" he said. ""It""s a shame for us to have to pay a 25 percent fee and have that going just to get our products here, rather than having those dollars being invested for future projects.""

""""Call authentication"" is critical for protecting consumers against these calls,"" Pai said Thursday.

politico|"ATLANTA — When Joe Biden launched his presidential campaign, he dubbed it the "" battle for the soul of the nation ."" Locals argue that battle is being waged in Georgia as the rest of the country looks on. Democrats now control all of Washington, after Biden won Georgia and both Senate seats here flipped in January. But Republicans still run all the levers of state government here, and they""re rallying behind a sweeping new election law that could tilt the political pendulum back in their column in 2022, when nine statewide executive offices and a high-profile Senate race will be on the ballot. SB 202 , signed into law by GOP Gov. Brian Kemp in late March, is either the epitome of voter suppression or the embodiment of election integrity — depending on whom you ask. Biden decried the law as ""Jim Crow in the 21st century,"" though the final product didn""t restrict voting as much as some of  the headline-grabbing early legislative proposals. The clash over SB 202 is thrusting Georgia back into the national spotlight after a tumultuous year: Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man, was killed by white vigilantes. Rayshard Brooks, another Black man, was shot to death by police. Former President Donald Trump pressured local election officials to overturn his loss here. Then there was the March massacre targeting Asian Americans, and, less than two weeks ago, the arrest of a Black state legislator protesting the new law under the gold dome of Georgia""s state capitol. The fight over the future of elections in Georgia — and, some say, the soul of the nation — is playing out on multiple fronts, materializing as not only a political battle but also a legal battle, a legislative battle and a moral battle. And now, as businesses from Coke to Delta condemn the law, and Republicans threaten to retaliate by zapping their tax breaks , it""s become a corporate battle, too. On Friday, the sports world got involved, when Major League Baseball pulled its All-Star Game and its draft out of the state. But not everyone, including Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, agrees that boycotts are the answer. What""s happening here is being duplicated across the country — Georgia is among the 47 states where legislators have introduced more than 360 restrictive voting bills, according to a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice — and elected officials and voters across the country are paying attention. ""We are the test once again for what happens and where this leads us down the road,"" said Khadijah Abdur-Rahman, a Democratic Fulton County commissioner. Abdur-Rahman represents the largest district, land-wise, in the county. Her constituents run the gamut from working class, single-parent households and people who need affordable housing assistance, to upper-middle-class Black families. It""s a heavily Democratic district, but Republicans comprise about 15 percent of it, including a sprinkling of Black Republicans who the commissioner says believe the law is unnecessary. On a Sunday afternoon, Abdur-Rahman sat in her downtown Atlanta office, talking to a reporter. On the coat rack hung a pair of purple boxing gloves, a reminder to Abdur-Rahman to never stop fighting for her constituents. The day before, she was putting that principle to work, rallying outside City Hall, where the top row of steps was barricaded by the Atlanta Police. Dozens of people were in attendance, wearing face masks and carrying signs that read ""Jim Crow 2.0"" and ""Stop voter suppression,"" a mix of white, Black and brown protesters. There were young adults and those with silver hair, including an elderly white woman in a wheelchair holding a lengthy sign highlighting the number of Republican state  senators (34) and representatives (100) who ""voted for white supremacy & fascism."" A DJ set up shop while a seemingly endless roster of speakers let loose for more than two hours. It was a rally, yes, but it also felt like a combination of church, a protest and a concert. Protesters chanted, ""You about to lose yo"" job,"" a pointed message to Kemp, who is up for reelection next year. Abdur-Rahman took to the stage in the opening minutes of the rally. ""I can go to the ATM machine and use my card after hours, but I gotta vote between banker hours?"" she shouted into the microphone. ""It doesn""t make any sense. So what I say to you is, 'I""m mad, I""m angry as hell, and we are coming together!'"" At a barbecue joint in northeast Atlanta, two older white men sat at a table talking about Covid-19, China and congressional Democrats"" sweeping election reform bill. People would illegally vote 20 times if voter ID requirements weren""t in place, one of the men said, as his companion nodded in agreement. But when approached by a reporter, their conversation ended abruptly, and they high-tailed it out of the restaurant. Across the country, Republicans"" views on voting have shifted dramatically. A 2018 Pew Research Center survey found that 48 percent of Republicans said everything possible should be done to make it easy to vote. But a new Pew Research Center survey published last week found that just 28 percent of Republicans felt that way. And more than 6 in 10 Republicans also said changing election rules to make it easier to register and vote would make elections less secure. Republicans here say election integrity is a top concern for their constituents in Georgia. ""My constituents wanted it. They did. I hope that helps. Thank you,"" sputtered state Rep. Mike Cheokas, a Republican, before hanging up the phone. Others argue Democrats are stirring the pot to rally their own voters and score political points. ""Nobody""s stopping any Blacks from voting. Nobody""s stopping Black churches from doing Souls to the Polls events,"" Kathleen Thorman, chair of the Gordon County Republican Party, told POLITICO. ""Everybody wants everyone to vote that""s a registered voter, that""s a legal voter,"" she said. ""This attack has no merit. It""s ludicrous. It""s just trying to make Republicans look bad."" Democrats who weren""t in the trenches here wrote off Georgia a long time ago. They didn't see the state as being anywhere within striking distance for them. But after Democrats swept the presidential election and two Senate runoffs, the state has become the center of the political universe in the U.S. ""This is who Georgia is, and we""re gonna continue to push forward and bring the rest of the country along with us,"" said Rep. Nikema Williams (D-Ga.), who represents the late John Lewis"" district in Congress and became the first Black woman elected to lead the state Democratic Party in 2019. But now, Georgia Democrats"" biggest crusade is against SB 202, which will, among other things, reduce the time frame in which voters can request absentee ballots, requires an ID number or photocopy of an ID to request and return ballots, shortens the runoff period (which subsequently shortens the early voting window) — and prohibits anyone but poll workers from distributing water to voters waiting in line. The law, dubbed the ""Election Integrity Act of 2021,"" would also give the Republican-controlled state legislature more authority over the State Election Board. Kemp quickly signed the bill into law on March 25 behind closed doors, flanked by six white men posed next to a portrait of a slave plantation . That image did not go unnoticed. ""It""s certainly symbolic of what he did, trying to take us back to those times on the plantation by signing that legislation,"" Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) said in an interview. ""That""s representational of the Old South. The New South was represented on Nov. 3 and Jan. 5, when we elected President Biden in Georgia and when we elected two United States senators. … The New South will not be defeated."" Tensions were further inflamed when Democratic state Rep. Park Cannon, a Black woman, was arrested by white law enforcement officers after knocking on Kemp""s door during the signing. The entire episode is further galvanizing Black women across the state who have played key roles for years as organizers. In interviews, Black women here argue Republicans backed SB 202 because the state""s younger, increasingly diverse demographic makeup is threatening their hold on power. But rather than change the Republican Party""s policies to attract a diverse coalition of voters, they said, Republicans simply changed the rules under the guise of election integrity. At the rally outside City Hall, Karli Swift, a Black woman with braids, glasses and a gray shirt emblazoned with Stacey Abrams"" face held aloft a poster with a message printed in big, bold, black letters: ""F*ck around & find out — GA Black women,"" it read in all-caps. A photo of her poster later went viral.  A couple days later, at a table inside a Black-owned, members-only club called The Gathering Spot, Swift, a corporate lawyer who has worked for Democratic campaigns in the past, talked about what prompted her to show up that day. ""I was mad, tired,"" Swift recalled. ""It""s a sentiment that I think a lot of Georgians feel. Not even just Georgians."" Georgia Republicans, she said, ""passed a law that""s terrible. At the end of the day, it""s not going to help them get more voters, either, and then they have lit a fire under Democrats in Georgia. It""s like a lose-lose situation. I don""t know what they were thinking."" Republicans, for their part, insist the previous system was ripe for fraud and lament that the new law doesn't go far enough. (Election officials have said there is no evidence that fraud occurred in the presidential race or Senate runoffs.) ""We didn""t get everything that we wanted, but it""s a really good start,"" Jason Thompson, a Republican national committeeman from Georgia, said in an interview. ""The trust in our elections system in Georgia was really at an all-time low."" Kerry Luedke, the chair of the Cherokee County Republican Party, wrote in an email that her party was planning on sending thank-you notes to legislators who supported the bill, along with having a rally and social media campaign ""to explain the facts of the legislation."" ""If I was somebody living in the Black community, I would be so insulted that people are basically telling me that I""m not capable of getting out to vote, and I""m not capable of getting an ID to vote. I would be so insulted,"" said Thorman, the Gordon County GOP chair. ""Democrats are saying: ""You""re not smart enough, you""re not sharp enough, you""re not capable of getting out to vote,"""" Thorman added. Voting laws have animated voters on both sides of the aisle, albeit for very different reasons. Democrats commend Brad Raffensperger, Georgia""s Republican secretary of state, for standing up to Trump""s attempts to overturn his election loss — but say he""s since caved to members of his party. On the other hand, he""s fallen deeply out of favor with conservatives. ""There""s no way in hell I""d ever vote for him again,"" said Pamela Reardon, the co-founder and vice president of Metro Atlanta Republicans. Of Republican Geoff Duncan, she added: ""I like to say, ""Duncan is done."" He is the lieutenant governor. He""s done."" It""s unclear what, if any, legal action the Biden administration will take. Biden has said that protecting voting rights was something the Justice Department was examining. When pressed for more information, the White House referred questions to the DOJ. ""We are aware of the law, but have no further comment,"" a DOJ spokesperson told POLITICO. Meanwhile, Democrats and voting-rights groups have filed at least three separate lawsuits in federal court, and congressional Democrats are vowing to continue pushing for passage of legislation to expand voting access and address hate crimes. But it""s not clear how the litigation will play out in court. And Congress is unlikely to pass sweeping voting rights legislation without Senate Democrats first nuking the filibuster to allow bills to pass with a simple majority. Voting rights advocates say they will educate voters on the new law and help them obtain valid ID in case they""re forced to play by Republicans"" new rules in the 2022 midterms — when Kemp, Duncan, Raffensperger and Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock will all be on the ballot. And at the same time, activists are pressuring businesses headquartered in the state to come out against SB 202. Cliff Albright, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter, had a pointed message for the business community: ""Democracy is good for business. Voter suppression is not."" Republicans are threatening to pull the tax credits of corporations that speak out against the new law.  But some major corporations are doing just that. In a memo to employees last week, Delta CEO Ed Bastian wrote that ""the final bill is unacceptable and does not match Delta""s values."" Alfredo River, president of Coca-Cola""s North America operating unit, in a statement issued by the company , vowed to ""continue to work to advance voting rights and access in Georgia and across the country"" and acknowledged the company""s ""responsibility to protect"" and ""promote"" the right to vote. Some activists are pushing for a boycott of the state, which has been transformed by the entertainment industry in recent years. But others, from Ossoff to film mogul Tyler Perry , are insisting that a boycott will only hurt Georgians. On Wednesday, Abrams, the former state House minority leader and 2018 gubernatorial candidate who's almost certain to seek a rematch with Kemp next year, released a video , asking outsiders not to boycott the state. ""Black, Latino, AAPI and Native American voters whose votes are the most suppressed under SB 202, are also the most likely the most to be hurt by potential boycotts in Georgia,"" she said in the video. ""For our friends across the country, please do not boycott us."" And on Friday, after news broke that the baseball commissioner was pulling the All-Star Game out of Georgia, Abrams tweeted , ""Disappointed @MLB will move the All-Star Game, but proud of their stance on voting rights."" State Sen. Sheikh Rahman, a Democrat and an immigrant from Bangladesh, represents the most diverse district in the state Senate. His tenure represents many firsts, including the first Asian American state senator, first immigrant state senator and first Muslim legislator in the state. Rahman said Republicans are scared of people like him. SB 202, he predicted, would ""backfire"" because Asian American and Pacific Islander voters are ""not gonna stay on the sideline."" Over the final weekend in March, on a cool, gloomy day, local and federal lawmakers — Reps. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), Grace Meng (D-N.Y.), Mark Takano (D-Calif.), Al Green (D-Texas) and Andy Kim (D-N.J.) from the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and local Reps. Carolyn Bourdeaux (D-Ga.) and Williams — took a bus trip mirroring the 27-mile path the alleged shooter, a white man, took to attack three Asian American spas. The suspect killed eight people, including six Asian women. Local law enforcement has not called the killing spree a hate crime. Elected officials laid fresh flowers outside Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa, which sit across the street from each other in Atlanta. The entrance to Gold Spa was overwhelmed with withered flowers. Soggy signs read ""Hate is a virus,"" and ""Stop Asian Hate."" ""For those of us living in Georgia, we""ve been in the spotlight the last year, and we are incredibly exhausted,"" state Rep. Bee Nguyen, a Democrat, told POLITICO. ""But all the things that are happening — the voter suppression bill, this shooting and the way that there were attempts to censor the perpetrator and dehumanize the victims, the arrest of Rep. Park Cannon,"" Nguyen said, ""we are going to remember those things."" ""We are going to use our power to make change,"" she continued. ""And that change includes going to the ballot box."" Last Sunday, a similar message seeped into Warnock""s virtual sermon. The freshman senator, who still holds his position as the senior pastor of the famed Ebenezer Baptist Church, stood in the empty sanctuary, preaching about a ""governor"" in the Bible who was confronted with a decision but failed to listen to a woman about which choice to make. He never mentioned Kemp""s name, but as he spoke, a photo of the governor signing SB 202 and a video of Cannon""s arrest flashed across the screen. Warnock told congregants he was talking about politics on a Sunday morning ""because your vote is your voice,"" and ""democracy is the political enactment of a spiritual idea that all of us are children of the living God."" Voter suppression ""is not just a political issue,"" Warnock said. ""That""s a spiritual issue. That""s a moral issue."" Zach Montellaro reported from Washington. Josh Gerstein and Sam Mintz contributed to this report."
politico|"ATLANTA — Asian Americans in Georgia turned out in historic numbers to elect Joe Biden and send two Democrats to the Senate. Over the last four years, they""ve more than quadrupled their representation in the state house.  Now, in the wake of last week's deadly shootings here, fear and anger is driving a new push for political change. The majority of the victims of the massacre at three Atlanta area spas were Asian women. That fact — coupled with law enforcement""s reluctance to designate their murders as hate crimes — is fueling fury in Georgia's Asian American and Pacific Islander community. AAPI leaders are pushing for policy changes with a renewed sense of urgency. They want to change the way hate crimes are monitored. They want a national database that accurately tracks race-based violence. And they want to channel that anger to efforts to increase voter turnout, boosting AAPI political representation at the state and national level. Their success — or failure — could have lasting implications for both the survival of pending hate crimes legislation in Congress and the strength of Democrats"" hold on the Peach State. So they""re calling on their own to mobilize. Asian Americans, political leaders say, once largely sat at the fringes of U.S. politics. Their headfirst dive into organizing, which has been building for decades and yielded its greatest results in 2020, is keeping Georgia at the center of the political universe. ""With the newfound political currency that Asian Americans in Georgia have, we're willing to spend that and get stuff done,"" said Chris Chan, advisory chair to the Asian American Action Fund""s Georgia chapter. That desire for action was palpable at a weekend protest near the Georgia State Capitol. Flags were at half-staff on Saturday; metal barricades surrounded the entire building and stretched down the block. Police are ""trying to humanize the murderer,"" said Lucy Lee, a Chinese American Marietta resident who was among the more than 600 protesters. ""They are trying to stigmatize the victims and Asian community,"" said Lee, who wore a red, white and blue jacket and carried a massive American flag. ""That's the part I really cannot tolerate anymore."" Before the March 16 shooting, Lee said, she wasn""t politically active. That""s now changed. ""I'm an American. I'm not here just to make the money and go back to Asia,"" Lee said. ""I'm here to stay."" Last year, a combination of grassroots organizing and targeted advertising helped increase AAPI political participation ahead of the presidential election and Senate runoffs. Groups like the Asian American Action Fund spent millions tailoring their messages to AAPI voters . Campaign mailers and online and TV ads decried Donald Trump""s mishandling of the pandemic — and extolled the power of AAPI voters to make history in the 2020 elections. Organizers knocked on doors and cold-called voters in more than a dozen languages. Then, too, a yearlong spike in anti-Asian violence driven by rhetoric coming from the Trump White House also motivated Asian Americans to get involved, particularly in Georgia, experts say. Asian Americans in the state saw the largest jump of any group in voter participation between 2016 and 2020, with a 91 percent increase in ballots cast .  Exit polls showed a majority of those votes were cast for Joe Biden. If Democrats rely on the same playbook of consistent outreach to AAPI voters, they will likely maintain their momentum across the state in future elections. Georgia""s Asian American leaders, largely Democrats, want to keep the rapidly diversifying Atlanta suburbs blue. Young Asian activists, older voters who were once more reticent to be politically involved and Black and Latino communities have all become part of that coalition. That coalition was on display at the weekend rally, where hundreds of Black, Latino and Asian leaders and community members gathered in memory of the shooting victims. ""We've seen the Asian American community with this economic power and with the demographic growth translate into actual political power,"" said state Rep. Sam Park, who is Georgia""s first Korean American state representative. Gwinnett County, once a Republican stronghold and Georgia""s second most populous, elected Park in 2017, making him the first Asian American Democrat elected to the General Assembly. The influx of immigrants from nearly a half-dozen Asian countries — Korea, China, Vietnam, India and Pakistan — helped propel his success. Gwinnett County, which is now 11 percent Asian American, swung to Hillary Clinton in 2016 by six points. Biden tripled those gains in 2020, winning the district by 18 points. Park and other Asian American state leaders say they can draw a straight line from Trump""s anti-Asian rhetoric around the coronavirus last March to the steep uptick in violence against members of their communities. The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism found a nearly 150 percent increase in reported anti-Asian hate crimes in America""s 15 most populous cities since March 2020. Advocates believe many more crimes go unreported due to victims"" reluctance to come forward, sometimes out of victims"" mistrust of police or fear of retaliation. And until recently, a majority of incidents have come to pass without much public attention. Women and elders are particularly vulnerable, advocates say. Among the eight victims killed on March 16, six were Chinese and Korean women between the ages of 51 and 74. (The two other victims were white and Latina.) ""Certainly for AAPIs who may not have been involved before, this is a wake up call to say, ""You need to be involved,"""" said Judy Chu (D-Calif.), chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. At 21 members, the group is the largest it""s been in congressional history. ""The fact that we do have AAPI leaders at all is a result of increased AAPI political participation. But we need even more of it at every level of governance,"" Chu said. Four other Asian Americans now join Park in the Georgia state house as representatives and senators; they represent the varied Asian communities in Georgia. A core tenet of their outreach is a desire to squash the idea that Asian Americans are a ""model minority,"" one that leaders say is a myth painting them as monolithic, universally successful and lacking political agency. Inspiring more Asian Americans to get involved has allowed more nuance in policy that impacts them. ""A lot of the conventional wisdom, or what I've been told or heard from people, is that Asian people don't turn out. There's not that many of them,"" said Michelle Au, a state senator elected in 2020. ""People tend to have these unfair stereotypes about this electorate and the power of their votes."" Au""s state Senate district has the highest percentage of Asian Americans in Georgia , according to Census data — nearly a quarter of her constituents identify as Asian, more than twice the Georgia average and four times the United States average. She""s convinced those demographics played a role in Georgia""s newly-minted blue status. ""You could very plausibly argue that Asian Americans were the margin of victory in the state of Georgia,"" Au said. ""Because we did turn out."" That newfound sense of political agency is giving Georgia""s AAPI leaders a heightened level of responsibility to deliver on anti-hate crimes legislation while getting more members of their community involved politically. Last June, in the wake of the death of Ahmaud Arbery, a young Black man killed by white vigilantes last, Georgia lawmakers passed legislation that punishes hate crimes. But the March 16 shootings will test the limits of this law, which does not apply to standalone crimes and can only be used as an additional charge. Robert Aaron Long was charged in Fulton and Cherokee counties with eight counts of murder for the shooting. Investigators in both counties have yet to classify the shooting as a hate crime. Cherokee County law enforcement instead cited his alleged sexual addiction as the motive. Their reluctance has frustrated many state leaders within and outside the AAPI demographic who helped push for passage of last summer""s hate crimes law. ""I'm sick and tired of hearing about what happened with this sick and misguided person. I'm not interested in whether or not he had a bad day,"" said Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock in his remarks during Saturday""s rally. Still, not all Asian Americans in Georgia see the massacre as inherently political. The Korean American Association of Greater Atlanta, the region""s most established community group representing more than 50,000 Korean Americans, was slow to acknowledge that the shooting was a hate crime. Their silence caused friction among members of Atlanta""s Korean American community. Advocates familiar with discussions say the association at first did not want to call the shooting a hate crime until investigators did.  Waiting too long, they argue, could have lead to more tension. ""You""ll only invite more robbers if you leave a room with a broken window unattended,"" said Brian Kim, a Gwinnett County organizer and religious leader in the Korean American community.  Kim said that he and others in the area have taken the lead in organizing anti-hate crime events while the Korean American Association has taken a step back. There is also a level of internal conflict around political involvement among Asian Americans. Many who have been in the United States for generations are fairly conservative. Before Democrats increased their outreach to Asian Americans and more began running for office, a larger proportion were more likely to vote Republican, according to Asian Americans who have lived in Georgia for decades. Republicans in the state have yet to launch a sustained outreach campaign to the voting bloc ahead of next year""s elections. Meanwhile, AAPI Democrats say they are planning to harness the voting power of this demographic beyond next years"" battleground Senate and gubernatorial elections. ""We've got to keep everything warm,"" Chan said. Asian American political organizers need to ""keep our political strength going and our momentum, and then we're going to sweep into 2022,"" he said. Au and Park were among the Asian leaders who met with President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday. During the meeting, they proposed a number of actions to curb the spread of anti-Asian violence, including using better data to track and report the number of hate crimes that occur. Sheikh Rahman, a Bangladeshi American state senator, also met with Biden and Harris last week. He said the president had tears in his eyes as he listened to community advocates and political leaders talk about the racist violence they""ve faced over the years. ""They understood what was going on,"" Rahman said. ""This was a somber meeting."" The day after that meeting, at the rally in the shadow of the Georgia state Capitol, Lee talked about how she never spoke up about issues affecting the Asian American community, despite living in the U.S. for more than 30 years. But, she said, the shootings presented her with little choice, particularly when Cherokee County officials refused to call the shootings a hate crime. As she sees it, the massacre is the climax of the string of hate crimes against Asians in the country over the past year. ""I want to be part of this country,"" Lee said. ""That's why I feel, as a loyal American like everybody else, I want to make this country — although already the greatest country in the world — even better."" Catherine Kim and Eugene Daniels contributed to this report."
politico|"Welcome to POLITICO""s 2020 Transition Playbook,  your guide to one of the most consequential transfers of power in American history. So you""re saying there""s a (good) chance. That seems to be what President-elect JOE BIDEN is indicating by returning to Georgia before the two Senate runoffs there on Jan. 5, which Democrats need to sweep to win back control of the Senate, and with it, control over Washington""s agenda. The transition team announced this morning that Vice President-elect KAMALA HARRIS is heading to Savannah on Sunday, while Biden plans to go to Atlanta on Monday — the same day President DONALD TRUMP is flying to Dalton, Ga., for a rally with Republican Sens. KELLY LOEFFLER and DAVID PERDUE . Democrats are newly optimistic about JON OSSOFF  and  RAPHAEL WARNOCK""s chances based on early vote numbers , which show Black voters making up a larger percentage of the electorate than in November and higher early turnout in Democratic congressional districts in the state. Early-vote turnout has lagged in Republican-held congressional districts, likely leaving Loeffler and Perdue with a bigger deficit heading into Election Day than they had to make up on Nov. 3. Biden transition officials wouldn""t say this afternoon just how bullish they are. Asked what the trips to Georgia signal, JEN PSAKI , the incoming White House press secretary, said they showed that Biden""s message is resonating with voters, as it did in November. But she added, ""We""re not naive about the fact that this is a special election in early January, and we""re going to take no vote for granted."" Still, carving out the time for Biden and Harris to travel there, just before the special election day, signals there""s more than a glimmer of hope for Democrats in the state. The last Democrat to win a Senate seat in Georgia was ZELL MILLER , who won a special election in 2000. Should Democrats win both races and retake the Senate, it would reshape Biden""s presidency.  While Democrats would hold only a bare majority with Harris as tiebreaker, they""d control the Senate floor, allowing them to bring bills up for a vote such as the legislation the House passed Monday to increase stimulus checks to $2,000 a person. If Loeffler or Perdue wins and Sen. MITCH McCONNELL remains majority leader. ""It""s not that nothing will get done,"" said former Sen. BARBARA BOXER (D-Calif.), who spent 16 years alongside Biden in the Senate. ""But it will be very difficult for him to bring about the kind of change that people voted for."" There""s still a lot Biden almost certainly wouldn""t be able to coax the Senate to pass, even if Democrats have 50 votes in the Senate. Sen. JOE MANCHIN (D-W.Va.) has said he wouldn""t vote to scrap the filibuster, so most bills would still need 60 votes. But if Sen. CHUCK SCHUMER becomes majority leader, Boxer thinks Biden could convince enough Republicans to vote his way to help pass at least some legislation. ""I worked with Joe for many years, and he""s very persuasive,"" she said. Are you in touch with Biden""s transition team?

GARLAND RECUSAL WATCH — A recent series of recusals by D.C. Circuit Court Judge MERRICK GARLAND is fueling talk that he remains a leading candidate to become Biden""s attorney general. Per JOSH GERSTEIN, an asterisk in an order from a three-judge D.C. Circuit panel issued  Tuesday — turning aside a bid to block new Trump administration rules forcing public release of hospital pricing data — indicated that Garland bowed out of the case. His absence was something of a surprise since he heard arguments in the case back in October. A review of D.C. Circuit records shows Garland also stepped aside in an order issued last week in a case where an Indian tribe is suing Treasury Secretary STEVEN MNUCHIN over a dispute about CARES Act funding. Garland took part in oral arguments in that case on Dec. 4, but now appears to have recused. And back on Dec. 10, Garland recused from a life-or-death dispute involving executions of two federal prisoners. The court divided 5-4 in its ruling , denying a stay of the executions. That cleared the way for the government to execute the two men — a punishment carried out by lethal injection later that week. A D.C. Circuit spokesperson did not respond to messages seeking comment on the recusals, but a ruling from Garland""s court last year could provide clues. The court excoriated a military judge for seeking an immigration judge job from the Justice Department while simultaneously ruling on motions at a Guantanamo military tribunal. Garland has joined in at least one order recently in a civil case  involving private parties. That suggests he may have concluded that ethics and optics dictate he should keep out of cases involving the federal government until the president-elect formally makes his AG choice. Biden transition officials confirmed Wednesday the president-elect does not plan to make any further Cabinet announcements until after the new year. MEANWHILE, AT THE PENTAGON: Biden will nominate  KATHLEEN HICKS , a former Pentagon official under President BARACK OBAMA , as deputy secretary of Defense, LARA SELIGMAN reports. Hicks has been the rumored frontrunner for the No. 2 Pentagon job for months. She""d be the first woman to hold the job. ( MICHÈLE FLOURNOY was under secretary of Defense for policy.) Biden has also settled on COLIN KAHL , another former Pentagon official who later served as national security adviser to Biden when he was vice president, to take Flournoy""s old job. … AND AT THE WHITE HOUSE: Biden""s team also announced 27 more White House staff hires. Among the notable names: JESSICA HERTZ , who""s currently serving as the transition""s general counsel, will be staff secretary; and KATIE PETRELIUS , who was the Biden campaign""s national finance director, will be special assistant to the president for presidential personnel. Hertz""s hire as the transition""s general counsel, where she oversees enforcement of ethics rules, drew criticism from progressives due to her work as a regulatory lawyer for Facebook. Want to keep tabs on who""s in, who""s out and who""s still in the mix for Cabinet posts? Bookmark our Biden Cabinet tracker . STANDOFF AT OMB — YOHANNES ABRAHAM , the Biden transition""s executive director, reiterated this afternoon what Biden said earlier this week: The Pentagon and the Office of Management and Budget aren""t making things easy on the transition. During a virtual press briefing with reporters, Abraham homed in on the ramifications of OMB""s alleged noncompliance with the transition team — arguing that the agency was handicapping Biden""s ability to mount an effective economic response to the coronavirus pandemic and its vast financial fallout. ""OMB leadership""s refusal to fully cooperate impairs our ability to identify opportunities to maximize the relief going out to Americans during the pandemic, and it leaves us in the dark as it relates to Covid-related expenditures and critical gaps,"" Abraham said. JAKE SULLIVAN , Biden""s incoming national security adviser, expanded on the transition""s trouble with the Pentagon on Tuesday. ""Frankly, there hasn""t been really meaningful progress since transition officials went out and spoke to the intransigence of the department""s political leadership earlier this month,"" Sullivan told NPR""s SCOTT DETROW . ""At the start of this week, the Pentagon hadn""t granted a meeting with the transition team since Dec. 18. And literally dozens of written requests for information are outstanding as we speak."" CHALLENGE ACCEPTED: Sen. JOSH HAWLEY (R-Mo.) on Wednesday pledged to challenge Biden's victory in Pennsylvania and possibly other states on Jan. 6, when Congress is set to certify the results of the 2020 election. As KYLE CHENEY reports, Hawley's announcement guarantees that both chambers will be forced to debate the results of at least one state and vote on whether to accept Biden's victory, a process that McConnell had urged Republicans to avoid. It""s down to Marty Walsh or Julie Su for Labor secretary ( Bloomberg Law ) Biden asks Democratic senators to recommend judicial nominees ( HuffPost ) Former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge is backing Mayorkas ( The Wall Street Journal ) Biden will inherit huge backlog of Afghan, Iraqi interpreters waiting for U.S. visas ( The Washington Post ) Kathleen Hicks, Biden""s pick for deputy Defense secretary, outlined earlier this year how to cut defense spending ( Foreign Affairs ) It""s a little late for oppo on Biden himself — he was elected almost two months ago! — but we couldn""t resist unearthing this passage from ""What It Takes,"" RICHARD BEN CRAMER ""s beloved book on the 1988 presidential campaign. At the time, Biden could be found in the Senate gym for hours each day, Cramer writes: ""Well, actually, you couldn""t find him — that was the point. No staff, no outsiders allowed. Joe""s schedule would say ""staff time"" at least once a day, usually twice, and what that meant was gym time. Somehow, he had to blow off steam. TRANSITION TRIVIA ANSWER: All of them.

( https://subscriber.politicopro.com/proinfo )   THE MAIN EVENT — ""Handel wins Georgia special election,"" by Campaign Pro's Elena Schneider: ""Republican Karen Handel has won Georgia""s special election, holding off the most well-funded House candidate in history and deflating Democrats who yearned for a special election rebuke to President Donald Trump. Handel, who previously served as Georgia""s secretary of state, had 52 percent of the vote to Democrat Jon Ossoff""s 48 percent when the Associated Press called the race late Tuesday night after a six-month campaign in which Republicans hammered Ossoff as an ill fit for a traditionally conservative district. With her win, Handel protected Republicans"" 24-seat House majority and their hold on the 6th District in Atlanta""s northern suburbs, a longtime GOP seat that looked to be slipping from the party when Trump only carried it by 2 points in November. Democrats, spying an opening, poured millions of dollars into the special election when former Rep. Tom Price resigned to join Trump""s cabinet as the secretary of Health and Human Services. Ossoff, a former congressional aide and documentary filmmaker, captured the anti-Trump fervor coursing through the Democratic Party and raised over $23 million for his campaign. But Trump is not the only unpopular politician in the country, and Republicans once again used House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as a bogeyman in a major House race, linking Ossoff to her in TV ads, in door-to-door conversations with voters and even in the televised debates between Ossoff and Handel.""

Both are key to the group""s plans in 2018. The group has already planned to launch field operations in 30 competitive districts, with goals to knock on 10 million doors by Election Day.

politico|"ATLANTA — Gary Lawrence usually carries a .22-caliber revolver while out walking his dog in rural Georgia as protection against venomous snakes and coyotes. But he says he learned a hard lesson while rushing to catch a flight at Atlanta""s airport last month, the firearm forgotten in the pocket of a heavy coat. In the security line, he took off his belt, boots and leather coat and placed them on a conveyor belt to the X-ray machine when ""all of a sudden, I had about five cops around me."" One of the officers asked what was in his coat pocket. ""That""s when it hit me. I knew what was in my pocket. I just sank. I couldn""t deny it. I told him the story,"" said Lawrence, who has a state-issued license to carry a gun. Handcuffed, he was escorted away to spend a night in jail, charged with a misdemeanor. Now gun-friendly lawmakers in Georgia want people licensed to carry a gun to avoid arrest if they accidentally bring their firearms into the security checkpoint at the country""s busiest airport and willingly leave the security line. It comes as gun rights groups in Georgia push state lawmakers to broaden the places where people can legally take guns, including churches and other houses of worship. The labor union representing airport security screeners opposes loosening laws banning guns at security checkpoints, especially after one TSA officer was killed and three other people wounded last November in a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport. ""The public has had 12 years"" notice that guns are prohibited,"" said a statement from David Borer, general counsel for the American Federation of Government Employees. ""Sooner or later they need to take responsibility for violating the law that""s meant to protect our officers and the traveling public."" A total of 111 firearms were found last year at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, more than at any other airport nationwide, according to federal figures, besting even New York""s John F. Kennedy with 10 weapons found; Miami with 24; Chicago O""Hare with 16; and Los Angeles International with 19. In response, airport officials in Atlanta started a public outreach campaign to remind passengers not to walk into security checkpoints while armed. They put up larger signs and held a news conference to drive the message home. The proposal emerged after a former speaker of Georgia""s House of Representatives, Terry Coleman, was arrested last year when security screeners found a pistol in his briefcase. Coleman acknowledged carrying the gun but said it was an accident. The charges were dismissed after Coleman completed a pre-trial intervention program. Federal law prohibits people from carrying guns onto planes, though passengers can legally take a firearm if they declare it to authorities and follow rules about storing them in checked baggage. TSA officials turn over to local police anyone caught illegally carrying a gun at a security checkpoint. What happens next depends on local law. In Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, illegally carrying a gun into the security zone will get fliers arrested, just as it will at Newark International Airport in New Jersey or JFK International Airport in New York. Violators in Atlanta are also usually arrested. Lawmakers supportive of the plan in Georgia say some wiggle room should be allowed. They want to allow people licensed to carry a gun to avoid being arrested if they are caught at a security checkpoint carrying a firearm and obey instructions to leave. Offenders without a license to carry a gun could still be arrested. ""I would tell you that a lot of people carry a weapon,"" said state Rep. Alan Powell, a Republican who supports the bill. ""It""s almost like it""s just a second nature to them. And sometimes they forget where they have, you know, they basically forget they""ve got it in a briefcase or a suitcase."" A local prosecutor, Tasha Mosley, said those caught at Atlanta""s main airport checkpoint with guns have included politicians, clergy members, even one woman who was carrying two guns in her bag. Many defendants claim they forgot the weapons were there. Mosely said she once saw a judge who formerly worked as an airport baggage handler lecture a defendant about the time he moved a bag at the airport and a shotgun inside it fired. ""They don""t like the excuses, `I put it in my luggage to hide it from my child. I forgot I had it in my briefcase,"""" said Mosley, who carries a handgun for her own protection. ""I know where my gun is at all times. I can tell you how many rounds are in it."" The bill has not yet come up for a vote, and its prospects are unclear. Another gun bill failed last year because university officials strenuously objected to provisions that would have allowed people to carry guns on campus. That proposal was dropped this year. A coalition of clergy members have already criticized a provision to would overturn a blanket ban on carrying guns in church. Those convicted of a misdemeanor for carrying a gun into the secured areas of Georgia""s airports could face a $1,000 fine or up to a year of probation or prison time. However, charges are dismissed against most first-time offenders if they attend gun safety classes, surrender the firearm they illegally brought to the checkpoint and stay out of further trouble. They do not lose their license to carry a weapon in Georgia. TSA officials can separately fine them up to $11,000. Lawrence""s case has not yet been resolved. He said he would support a law that offers more protection to people who make mistakes, though he acknowledges the incident was his fault. ""I was wrong,"" he said. ""How could I say I wasn""t wrong?"""

MORE TROUBLE IN GEORGIA — A cybersecurity researcher discovered that an election server contained evidence that it was hacked before the 2016 election, Kim Zetter reported for POLITICO. The discovery not only calls into question the integrity of Georgia""s paperless voting machines, which are already the subject of much criticism, but raises even more questions about whether attackers were able to manipulate election data and voter information through the compromised server. Kim reported that it is unclear who may have carried out the attack or if voter information was altered, but Logan Lamb, the election security expert who uncovered the activity, believes hackers could have gained ""almost total control of the server including abilities to modify files, delete data, and install malware."" Read the full story here. STATE CYBER CZARS? — Sens. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), and Gary Peters (D-Mich.) introduced legislation on Thursday that would compel DHS to start a cyber coordinator program for states, giving each a dedicated digital security point person who could help coordinate cybersecurity defenses. ""When New Hampshire""s Strafford County and Sunapee School District were hit by ransomware attacks this past year, officials had systems in place to mitigate damage, "" Hassan said. ""But as they made clear to me, the federal government needs to do more to ensure that state and local entities have the resources and training that they need to prevent and respond to cyberattacks."" The coordinator role would be housed inside CISA, according to the bill, and would work with state officials to coordinate with Washington to beef up defenses and help with information sharing. HACKING IS A TEAM SPORT — Cybercriminals rarely work alone and most often will team up with others based on skills to carry out attacks, according to recently published research from Michigan State University . ""Hacking is really a social behavior,"" Thomas Holt, MSU professor of criminal justice and co-author of the study, told POLITICO. ""Hacking is very rarely a lone activity."" While hackers may form teams or more organized groups to carry out criminal campaigns, they typically don""t stick together long to execute other operations , according to Holt""s research, which applied a sociological model to analyze 18 cybercrime investigations in the Netherlands. Holt focused on Dutch cases because his co-author, E. R. Leukfeldt, is a researcher at the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement and because of the country""s work to prevent digital crimes. ""Being a small country in the EU, they are actually heavily invested in reducing cybercrime,"" he said. FBI PROMISES TO TALK TO STATES — The FBI will notify state election officials in addition to local ones when hackers breach a local election system , a policy shift that follows bipartisan criticism of its handling of Russian intrusions into two Florida counties in 2016. ""If the FBI only notifies a local election official of a cyber threat, it may leave the state official with incomplete knowledge about the threat landscape surrounding the integrity of the elections in their state,"" a senior FBI official told reporters in a Thursday briefing. The revised policy also advises agents to leave detailed documentation with local officials to help them resolve the incident. And it encourages coordination with other agencies, especially CISA — although the senior FBI official said the need to rapidly notify victims could sometimes preclude collaboration. The policy change pleased members of Congress from Florida — who had sharply criticized the FBI for not telling their state election office about the county breaches — but several of them said it wasn""t enough. Rep. Michael Waltz (R-Fla.) said it ""will be vital to improving our elections system and promoting transparency"" but said he would ""continue to press"" the FBI to tell the public about intrusions. FIRST IN MC: EAC INVESTIGATING TOP VENDOR""S BEHAVIOR — The Election Assistance Commission is investigating activists"" claims that major voting technology vendor Election Systems & Software misled prospective customers about the certification status of some of its ballot scanners . ""The EAC is aware of the situation highlighted in the letter from Free Speech For People and the National Election Defense Coalition, and we are working with our Testing and Certification staff to create a plan to follow up and investigate the issues raised,"" EAC spokeswoman Kristen Muthig told MC. In their Jan. 7 letter, the activist groups presented evidence that ES&S had claimed that its modem-enabled DS200 scanners were federally certified , even though the EAC only certified the version without a modem. The activists asked the EAC to punish ES&S for misrepresenting the certification issue and for not warning customers that adding a modem to a certified scanner would void its certification. If the EAC""s certification team determines that ES&S violated its rules, it can suspend the company from its certification program. That would temporarily prevent ES&S from selling any new voting equipment, although its customers could continue using their existing devices. The EAC could also decertify ES&S entirely, although that step — considered the nuclear option in the voting technology world — would take much longer. ES&S did not respond to a request for comment about the EAC""s investigation. MORE CONCERNS ON THE IRAN CYBER FRONT — The credit rating agency Moody""s weighed in on the potential for cyber blowback after the U.S. killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Although it is difficult to predict which sectors or issuers would be most at risk, ""there would likely be a wide range of potential targets,"" according to their assessment. Iranian hacking groups are believed to make greater attempts to strike operational technology and industrial control systems, but many experts are not certain Iran is sophisticated enough to carry out those types of attacks, the report explained. ""The inherent cyber risk exposure of issuers is largely defined by the sectors in which they operate and their business processes and activities, "" said Lesley Ritter, Moody""s vice president and lead author of the report. In creating a framework regarding the relative levels of cyber risks across sectors, they considered the median issue in each sector across two dimensions: vulnerability to the type of attack and impact, including the disruption of critical business processes and loss of data access. Both dimensions can lead to financial stress such as loss in revenue or more expenses for recovery. Top leaders on the Senate Small Business Committee, Chairman Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and ranking member Ben Cardin (D-Md.) urged Jovita Carranza, administrator of the Small Business Administration, in a letter this week to "" take immediate action"" to help small businesses gear up for potential cybersecurity attacks from Iran. NOT THE BEST LOOK  — Amnesty International panned the Israel Ministry of Defense""s decision to hold a closed-door hearing on legal action seeking to revoke the export license of spyware firm NSO Group . It""s an attempt to ""avoid the full glare of public scrutiny,"" said Danna Ingleton, deputy director of Amnesty Tech. ""The cozy complicity between governments and the shadowy surveillance industry has to end. We will continue to make every effort to ensure NSO Group""s invasive products can no longer be used to commit human rights abuses around the world."" Human rights groups have fought for legal action against NSO Group, contending its Pegasus software has been used to spy on journalists and political adversaries . MAYBE DON""T USE THIS LIFELINE — Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden (Ore.) and Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) on Thursday sent a letter to Sprint CEO Michel Combes raising concerns the phone giant has sold Lifeline devices infected with malware. The pair cite recent research that found one of the company""s phones came with pre-installed Chinese malware.

axios|"Several civil rights groups filed a lawsuit against Georgia election officials challenging Republican-crafted voting restrictions signed into law by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp on Thursday. Why it matters: The lawsuit from New Georgia Project, Black Voters Matter Fund and Rise alleges that the restrictions violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the 14th Amendment by inflicting ""unjustifiable burdens"" that disproportionately affect people of color and young, poor and disabled citizens. But, but, but: Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, one of the defendants in the lawsuit, has repeatedly said his office found no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, despite baseless claims to the contrary by former President Trump. The big picture: Georgia is the first battleground state to enact sweeping new legislation rolling back voting rights in the wake of the 2020 election, which saw record levels of mail-in and early voting due to the pandemic.

usa_today|"Former President Donald Trump continued his war of words with Georgia's top Republican elected officials while arguing the state's controversial new election law doesn't go far enough. ""Georgia""s election reform law is far too weak and soft to ensure real ballot integrity,"" Trump said in a written statement Tuesday where he blasted Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. ""Election Day is supposed to be Election Day, not Election Week or Election Month,"" he added. ""Far too many days are given to vote."" Peach State lawmakers have made major changes to their election protocols in the wake of last year's Democratic victories and Trump's false assertions about the 2020 presidential election outcome. President Joe Biden beat Trump to win Georgia""s 16 electoral votes by about 12,000 votes in the November presidential election, and Democrats won two Jan. 5 Senate runoffs to give the party control of the upper chamber of Congress. Georgia's new law, signed by Kemp at the end of March, is part of a national trend of Republican-sponsored proposals that supporters say are aimed at ensuring election integrity. But the changes in Georgia have ignited a fiery debate as national brands, major employers and professional sports leagues have spoken out against the new law, which critics argue is aimed at making it harder for Democratic constituencies to vote. Among the more contested moves made by the Georgia legislature are voter ID requirements and shrinking the request period for absentee ballots, which opponents contend will disproportionately affect Black voters. The new law also prohibits people from handing out food or water within 150 feet of a polling place, or within 25 feet of any voter; gives state legislators the power to remove and replace county election officials; and curtails the secretary of state's power as chief elections officer. Georgia Republicans had originally proposed a much stricter election bill in line with Trump's comments on Tuesday. That plan would have limited early voting, which was slammed by many Black church leaders who said it was an effort to erode their ""souls to the polls"" initiatives that funnel their members to vote after religious services. Kemp and other GOP leaders in the state have fiercely defended the new law and warned companies against speaking out against it , pointing out that it expands the number of early voting days by requiring at least two Saturdays of early voting for each primary and general election.It also guarantees a minimum number of drop boxes, especially in rural areas, which weren't allowed in Georgia before the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020. ""I""m telling you the truth about this bill,"" Kemp said in a radio interview with NPR this month. ""It expands access."" But Trump didn't spare the governor or Raffensperger, , two of his most frequent targets since he lost the 2020 presidential contest. More: Donald Trump endorses rival to Georgia Republican elections official Brad Raffensperger For months, Trump has argued the two didn't fight hard enough to deliver Georgia for Trump in the 2020 presidential race. He has called for primary challengers to take on both in next year's statewide election, and has promised to campaign against the two. Calling Kemp and Raffensperger ""RINOS"" — short for ""Republicans In Name Only"" — the former president said in his statement they should have fought to eliminate no-excuse mail-in voting and drop boxes while expanding signature verification. Trump also took Kemp to task for not saying more as the law has come under withering criticism from national brands such as Delta Airlines, Coca-Cola and Microsoft. Last Friday, for instance, Major League Baseball announced that it was moving its July 13 All-Star Game out of Atlanta over the legislation. The game is now set to take place in Denver. Critics of the law have now turned to pressuring a boycott of the Masters golf tournament in Augusta, Ga. ""Kemp also caved to the radical left-wing woke mob who threatened to call him racist if he got rid of weekend voting,"" Trump said. ""Well, he kept it, and they still call him racist!"""
usa_today|"AUGUSTA, Ga. – Controversy has arrived once again at the doorstep of Augusta National Golf Club. This most mysterious and beautiful sports venue, fashioned as an oasis representing a simpler time, has for decades tried to shield itself from the pressures and politics of current-day Americana. Mostly, it has succeeded. When the real world demanded more, the club acquiesced, eventually. There are Black members now, and women, but not many. This is still almost exclusively a white man""s playground, which makes the confluence of events at this moment in the state in which it is located all the more fascinating. Eleven days ago, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed into law a sweeping Republican-sponsored voter suppression bill that includes new restrictions on voting by mail, greater GOP legislative control over state and county election officials and a prohibition against outside groups giving food or water to people waiting in line to vote. The bill, which civil rights groups believe will restrict voting access for people of color, is rooted in former President Trump""s notoriously false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, both across the nation and in Georgia. Not insignificant to this conversation is the fact that President Biden won Georgia, while both of the state""s Republican-held U.S. Senate seats were won by Democrats. Kemp signed the law March 25 with six white men by his side and a painting of a former slave plantation behind him. Little more than a week later, Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred announced that the 2021 All-Star Game was being moved out of Atlanta . The reason? The new Georgia law. ""Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box,"" Manfred said in a statement. His momentous decision and its timing right before the next big sports event in the state immediately put Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley on the clock. (In a plot twist few probably saw coming, Manfred also happens to be a member of Augusta National.) So what will Ridley do? There have been calls to move the Masters out of Georgia, but that""s not happening. Of course it isn't. The Masters and Augusta National are synonymous. If you move the Masters out of Georgia, it""s no longer the Masters. The pressure on Ridley is far more nuanced. He speaks Wednesday at his annual chairman""s news conference where he will be expected to discuss what he and the club think about this law, and what they will do about it, if anything. Ringing the room will be dozens of green-jacketed Augusta National members, many of them titans of American industry, including some of the most powerful people in Georgia. If they had wanted to, they most likely could have convinced Kemp to not sign that law. Whether that thought even crossed their minds is debatable; one has to presume that many of them voted for Trump. Perhaps they even like the law. Ridley will let us know. He has followed the lead of former chairman Billy Payne, who brought in the club""s first two women members in 2012 and started a kids"" competition for both boys and girls in 2013, by bringing slow but steady change to the place. Some of us never believed they would hold a women""s tournament at Augusta National; the second installment of their Women""s Amateur was just held on Saturday. Not a year goes by without Ridley talking about issues of diversity and inclusion in golf, topics that are essential to the game""s demographic and economic future. Yet, while practically every other sport has undergone a reckoning over the last year in the wake of the death of George Floyd, golf remains predictably untouched by American cultural and racial change. Golf and social justice have a most interesting relationship. Basically, they don""t have one. Ridley is one of the very few people who can do something about that, starting this Wednesday."
usa_today|"AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — While a tempest brews outside Magnolia Lane over Georgia""s voting rights law, Augusta National would prefer to keep the focus on blooming azaleas, pimento cheese sandwiches and tricky greens. That strategy has served the home of the Masters well in previous debates over efforts to keep out Black and female members. So, it was no surprise when Chairman Fred Ridley played through any attempt Wednesday to ensnare his club in another contentious issue. ""We realize that views and opinions on this law differ, and there have been calls for boycotts and other punitive measures,"" Ridley said during his annual State of the Masters news conference on the eve of the opening round. ""Unfortunately, those actions often impose the greatest burdens on the most vulnerable in our society."" There was never any doubt Augusta National would take a different path than Major League Baseball, which yanked this summer""s All-Star Game from Atlanta to show its displeasure with new voting restrictions that were signed into law two weeks ago by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. Opponents say the law is designed to reduce the electoral power of people of color after a record turnout last November, fueled by absentee and early voting, led to Joe Biden becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate since 1992 to carry the Peach State. Then, in a January runoff election, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff unseated a pair of GOP incumbents in Georgia to effectively swing the balance of power in the U.S. Senate. Supporters of the law, including Kemp, have said it's nothing more than an attempt to preserve electoral integrity on the heels of baseless claims by Donald Trump that the presidency was stolen from him by fraudulent votes. ""I believe, as does everyone in our organization, that the right to vote is fundamental in our democratic society,"" Ridley said. ""No one should be disadvantaged in exercising that right, and it is critical that all citizens have confidence in the electoral process."" When asked bluntly if he supported or opposed the new law, Ridley laid up. ""I don""t think that my opinion on this legislation should shape the discussion,"" he said. ""I know you would like for us to make a proclamation on this. I just don""t think that is going to be helpful to ultimately reaching a resolution."" Ridley's stance was very much in keeping with the club""s history on other racial and social matters. For decades, Augusta National had no black members. It was only in 1975 that Lee Elder became the first Black player to be invited to the Masters. Finally, after protests erupted over the 1990 PGA Championship being held at all-white Shoal Creek Country Club in Birmingham, the home of the Masters quietly admitted its first black member, television executive Ron Townsend. More recently, the club steadfastly rebuffed calls to allow female members. Former chairman Hootie Johnson said the club would make such as decision on its terms, ""not at the point of bayonet."" A decade later, Augusta National let in its first female members, including one-time Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Again, there was little fanfare about the decision. Now, it""s voting rights. MLB""s decision last week to strip the All-Star Game from Atlanta""s Truist Park turned the focus to the Masters, the first of three prominent golf tournaments that will be held in Georgia this year. The Women""s PGA Championship is set for the Atlanta Athletic Club in June, while the PGA Tour""s season-ending Tour Championship will be staged in September at East Lake in Atlanta, which took over as the event""s permanent home in 2004. The National Black Justice Coalition called for the Masters to be moved out of Georgia, but that was never a serious consideration. Augusta National controls every aspect of the tournament and would never think of it being played anywhere but its historic layout along Washington Road, one of the most famous golf courses in the world. For that matter, the PGA Tour also said the Tour Championship will remain at East Lake, citing the tens of millions of dollars in economic development that the tournament has spurred in the once-downtrodden neighborhood surrounding the club. There""s no indication, either, that the Women""s PGA will be moving to another state. Similar to East Lake, Ridley announced in November a $10 million donation to help with the redevelopment of what he said were once-thriving communities that have gone through decades of poverty, crime and unemployment. But even if moving the Masters was never on the table, anyone with a knowledge of golf""s checkered racial history would have suspected it was never going to be a leading voice on voting rights. The PGA had a Caucasian-only policy until 1961, 14 years after Jackie Robinson broke baseball""s color barrier. Cameron Champ is one of the few players on color on the PGA Tour (he has a Black father and white mother). Last year, as protests roiled the country after the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, as well as the shooting of Jacob Blake, Champ was the lone golfer to take a prominent stand. At the BMW Championship, he wore one black shoe and one white shoe. He also wrote the names of Taylor and Blake on his footwear. ""I remember walking onto the range, and I had Breonna Taylor and Jacob Blake on my shoes, and I got asked by three different people, ""Who are they?"""" Taylor said this week. ""That proves the point of why I""m doing it."" So far, no golfers have followed his lead. ""There""s not many people who are willing to talk about it, so you""re never going to hear it,"" Champ said. ""It just kind of gets pushed to the back burner like it does always."" Everyone at Augusta National says they support equal voting rights, but Champ was the only one who stated his opposition to the Georgia law, which imposes new restrictions on absentee and early voting, grants sweeping new powers to the GOP-controlled State Elections Board to take over local elections, and limits the handing out of food and water to voters standing in long lines. ""As you can tell, it really targets certain black communities and makes it harder to vote, which to me it""s everyone""s right to vote,"" Champ said. ""For me to see that, it""s very shocking."" In a sport where Trump enjoyed widespread support, four-time major champion Rory McIlroy has been one of the few players to take an opposing political stand. The Northern Irishman criticized the former president""s leadership last year during the coronavirus pandemic and said he wouldn""t play golf with him again. When asked for his opinion of the Georgia voting law, McIlroy picked his words carefully. ""I""m not a citizen of this country, but I certainly think all great countries and democracies are built on equal voting rights and everyone being able to get to the ballot boxes as easily as possible,"" he said. But now, it""s time to tee it up. In something of a nod to the uglier parts of its history, the club in November said it would invite the 86-year-old Elder to take part in the ceremonial first tee shot with Masters greats Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player. After that, there likely will be no more discussion about Georgia""s voting law at the home of the Masters. ___ Follow Paul Newberry on Twitter at https://twitter.com/pnewberry1963 His work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/paulnewberry ___ More AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
usa_today|"Major League Baseball will move its All-Star Game out of Atlanta after the state of Georgia passed voting bills that will disproportionately affect citizens of color, an action that commissioner Rob Manfred on Friday said is the ""best way to demonstrate our values as a sport."" MLB""s removal of one of its jewel events – which this year will include the draft for the first time – comes after a year in which the COVID-19 pandemic and the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer caused the sports industry to reconsider its influence within society. That recalibration was most felt in Georgia, where members of the WNBA""s Atlanta Dream organized against one of its owners, former Sen. Kelly Loeffler, and urged Georgians to exercise their right to vote. By January, control of the U.S. Senate flipped to Democrats after Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff won runoff elections, with Warnock defeating Loeffler. ALL-STAR GAME : MLB's move is most important move since integration REPLACING ATLANTA : Where will MLB move the game? On March 26, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed legislation passed by both state houses a Republican-led overhaul of state elections, rolling back voting by mail and other absentee balloting efforts and even banning the distribution of food and water to those standing in line to vote. President Joe Biden called the bill ""sick"" and ""un-American"" and on March 31 told ESPN he would support MLB moving its Midsummer Classic out of Atlanta. Just more than three months before its stars were to gather July 13 for the 91st All-Star Game, Manfred did just that. ""Over the last week, we have engaged in thoughtful conversations with Clubs, former and current players, the Players Association, and The Players Alliance, among others, to listen to their views,"" Manfred said in a statement. ""I have decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year""s All-Star Game and MLB Draft. Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box."" ""We will continue with our plans to celebrate the memory of Hank Aaron during this season""s All-Star festivities.  In addition, MLB""s planned investments to support local communities in Atlanta as part of our All-Star Legacy Projects will move forward.  We are finalizing a new host city and details about these events will be announced shortly."" In making a stand against discrimination, MLB joins the NBA – which moved its 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte due to state legislation discriminating against transgender community – and the NFL, which moved the 1993 Super Bowl out of Arizona after the state refused to recognize Martin Luther King Day as a holiday, in organizations hitting municipalities in their pocketbook. The host franchise did not echo the sentiments of the league. In a statement, the Braves said they were ""deeply disappointed"" by MLB's decision and that this was ""neither our decision nor our recommendation and we are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city."" Kemp, a Republican, issued an even more withering statement, hitting significant talking points echoed by his party and wading ever deeper into culture warriordom. ""Today, Major League Baseball caved to fear, political opportunism, and liberal lies,"" said Kemp in a statement released late Friday afternoon. ""Georgians - and all Americans - should fully understand what the MLB's knee-jerk decision means: cancel culture and woke political activists are coming for every aspect of your life, sports included. If the left doesn""t agree with you, facts and the truth do not matter. ""This attack on our state is the direct result of repeated lies from Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams about a bill that expands access to the ballot box and ensures the integrity of our elections. I will not back down. Georgians will not be bullied. We will continue to stand up for secure, accessible, fair elections. Earlier today, I spoke with the leadership of the Atlanta Braves who informed me they do not support the MLB's decision."" MLB did not specify to which city it""d relocate the All-Star Game, which due to its fixed date and lone spot on the sporting calendar is its biggest corporate event of the year. Atlanta was awarded this game on May 30, 2019, a standard ""reward"" from the league to celebrate the opening of a new stadium. The Braves moved from Turner Field downtown to SunTrust Park - now Truist Field - in Cobb County in 2017. Similarly, Los Angeles was awarded the 2020 All-Star Game after extensive renovations to Dodger Stadium; that game was cancelled due to the pandemic and the Dodgers will instead host the 2022 game. It is a three-day festival of baseball that includes the July 11 Futures Game, July 12 Home Run Derby and dozens of fan-focused events and significant corporate glad-handing. This year""s game was to honor Braves legend Hank Aaron, who broke Babe Ruth""s all-time home run record in 1974 and remains an American icon; Aaron died Jan. 22 at age 86. In this instance, MLB chose immediate action first and logistics later, and figures to choose its new site based on a combination of fan convenience and a state not actively seeking to pass voting restriction bills similar to Georgia""s. That would seem to rule out Texas, which opened its doors to the 2020 National League Championship Series and World Series, as Arlington's Globe Life Field hosted the first MLB games to host fans since the start of the pandemic. Texas' state senate on Thursday passed Bill 7 in a party line vote , giving it a path to approval under Gov. Greg Abbott, and the bill has since come under criticism from corporate entities such as Dallas-based American Airlines."

usa_today|"What if Georgia election officials had somehow found those nonexistent votes that then-President Donald Trump pressured them to ""find"" to overturn his narrow loss in the Peach State? What if there hadn""t been a secretary of state with not only the spine but the authority to make sure the election was immune from partisan cheating? It would have been a devastating loss for democracy, that""s what. And it would have been much easier to pull off had Georgia""s brand-new election law been in place. Thanks to a somewhat overlooked provision in Georgia""s new restrictive voting law and similar measures being pushed in more than a half-dozen other GOP-controlled legislatures, the skids are becoming better greased for Trump-style election tampering in the future. These attempts to subvert the will of voters must be stopped. Tucked inside the new Georgia elections law is a measure that shifts a significant amount of election oversight power from the secretary of state and county election boards to the legislature. The measure removes the elected secretary of state as chair of the state election board and replaces him or her with an appointee of the Republican-run legislature. Such a coincidence! Just a few months after Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger says ""no"" to magical vote-finding, the legislature takes a chunk of power and authority from his office and shifts it to someone of their choosing — and, we can only assume, more likely to do their bidding. The law doesn""t just change who picks the chair. Now, the majority of the board""s members will be legislative appointees, and the board gains ominous new power: the ability to remove and replace election officials administering the vote at the level where the real elections work happens — the county level. Let""s say the state board does not like the way vote-counting is going in heavily Democratic Fulton County. Under the new law, the board can fire those in charge and plop in a new boss more to its liking. ""After the November election last year,"" Gov. Brian Kemp said as he signed the bill into law, ""I knew … that significant reforms to our state elections were needed."" Given that no one has produced evidence of large-scale cheating, fraud, counting dead people""s votes, or losing living people""s votes, I think we know what Kemp sees as needing ""reform"": Democrat Joe Biden's victory in previously red Georgia. ""Republicans are brazenly trying to seize local and state election authority in an unprecedented power grab,"" says voting rights leader Stacey Abrams , former Democratic leader in the Georgia State House. The new law, she says, is ""intended to alter election outcomes and remove state and county election officials who refuse to put party above the people … Had their grand plan been law in 2020, the numerous attempts by state legislatures to overturn the will of the voters would have succeeded."" Abrams is one of many calling the new Georgia law unconstitutional, and three voting-rights groups have filed a lawsuit . Not to play judge, but bear in mind that the Constitution forbids states from placing undue burdens on citizens"" right to vote. It stands to reason that includes the burden imposed by politicians"" power-grabbing authority over election administration. Stacey Abrams: Don't boycott corporations over voting rights yet. First press them to speak up. Arizona — which like Georgia dealt Trump a narrow defeat — is also weighing  legislation that would make election oversight more prone to partisan manipulation; one measure introduced there would give the GOP-led legislature authority over the state elections manual, which now rests in the hands of the governor, attorney general and secretary of state.  Overall, as the New York Times reports, GOP legislators in at least eight states are pushing bills that would take election oversight power away from secretaries of state, governors and nonpartisan election boards, and turn it over to legislatures. Republican lawmakers must be savoring the prospect, as foxes generally do when they""re about to take over guard duty at the henhouse. Party leaders will tell you that moves like these are necessary to restore public confidence in elections. Quite a trick, that. The only reason confidence needs restoring is that Trump and his party destroyed it by pushing the big lie that that November""s election was rigged and stolen. As attested by judge after judge and election official after election official, Republican appointees as well as Democrat, there is no evidence of cheating or fraud at anything approaching the scale that would change the outcome of the Nov. 6 vote. Use every tool to protect voting: The Georgia Republican Party wants to set voting rights back decades. Is your state next? I don""t doubt that some everyday Republicans sincerely believe the lie that""s been fed to them by right-wing media and the ex-president. But it""s increasingly obvious that the most aggressive and high-profile propagators of the lie — hello, Sidney Powell — don""t mean it literally when they tell it. Trumpian words like ""rigged,"" ""fraud,"" and ""steal"" should be taken as code words. Their real meaning? The election was decisively influenced by people who should not be allowed so much say in electing the president and determining the direction of the country. The only thing ""wrong"" with the 2020 presidential election is that a lot of liberals and people of color voted, and the ""wrong"" person won. What""s truly wrong is changing election laws to make sure those people can""t do it again.

usa_today|"ATLANTA (AP) — The CEO of Georgia-based Delta Air Lines said Wednesday that the state""s new election law overhaul is ""unacceptable"" and ""based on a lie,"" after the company faced criticism that it didn""t speak out forcefully enough in opposition to the bill when it was being considered by the state""s Republican leaders. CEO Ed Bastian offered his assessment of the new Georgia law in a memo sent to employees less than a week after Delta officials joined other corporate lobbyists to shape the final version of a sweeping measure that could make it harder for some Georgia citizens to cast ballots. The memo, obtained by The Associated Press, comes amid a smattering of calls for consumer boycotts of Delta and other Georgia-based brands, including Coca-Cola, UPS and Home Depot. The Major League Baseball players union also has raised the possibility of moving the summer All-Star game from the Atlanta Braves home stadium. No more empty middle seats: Delta ending pandemic policy May 1 Delta Air Lines initially issued a statement touting some parts of the law, such as expanded weekend voting, but said ""we understand concerns remain over other provisions in the legislation and there continues to be work ahead in this important effort."" But Bastian spoke more forcefully in Wednesday""s memo to employees. ""The entire rationale for this bill was based on a lie: that there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 elections. This is simply not true,"" Bastian wrote, alluding to former President Donald Trump""s claims that his loss was due to fraud. ""Unfortunately, that excuse is being used in states across the nation that are attempting to pass similar legislation to restrict voting rights."" Bastian repeated that Delta ""joined other major Atlanta corporations to work closely with elected officials from both parties, to try and remove some of the most egregious measures from the bill. We had some success in eliminating the most suppressive tactics that some had proposed."" But, he emphasized, ""I need to make it crystal clear that the final bill is unacceptable and does not match Delta""s values."" The new law was signed last week by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, hours after it cleared the state legislature. It is part of a tide of GOP-sponsored election bills introduced in states across the country after Trump""s false assertions about the 2020 elections. President Joe Biden won Georgia""s 16 electoral votes by about 12,000 votes out of almost 5 million cast, and Democrats won two Jan. 5 Senate runoffs to give the party control of the chamber on Capitol Hill. Georgia officials, including Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, also a Republican, have vouched for the accuracy of the election counts even as they backed some changes that could make it harder for Georgians to cast absentee ballots, a method that more than a fifth of the November electorate used. The fight may not be over yet:  Georgia""s new GOP election law draws criticism, lawsuits The Georgia law adds a photo ID requirement for voting absentee by mail, cuts the amount of time people have to request an absentee ballot and limits where drop boxes can be placed and when they can be accessed. It also bans people from handing out food or water to voters waiting in line and allows the Republican-controlled State Election Board to remove and replace county election officials while curtailing the power of the secretary of state as Georgia""s chief elections officer. Republicans in Georgia insist the changes are needed to restore voters"" confidence. Civil rights and voting rights groups have filed multiple federal lawsuits challenging the Georgia law. Activists also have turned their attention to congressional Democrats"" push for sweeping federal action on voting rights. Democrats"" measures in Washington could effectively override many of the changes being enacted in Georgia and considered in dozens of other state legislatures led by Republicans."

Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey criticized the legislation in an April 1 statement and called it ""unacceptable"" and ""a step backward"" during an interview with CNBC . Days later, a group of Republican Georgia lawmakers called for a boycott of Coca-Cola, however, the products are not being removed from all state-owned buildings. Ann Moore, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola, told USA TODAY in an emailed statement that the ""rumor is not true.""

In it, Goodell said a number of NFL employees had asked about the league""s stance on the new voting laws passed in Georgia and also under consideration in other states. Goodell wrote, ""We know that the right to vote is fundamental and at the core of our democracy. We will always support that right, and the NFL has done so in a comprehensive and thoughtful way.

usa_today|"Once again, Georgia found itself in the national spotlight for yet another controversial and polarizing political topic — election reform legislation. As the lieutenant governor of Georgia I had a front row seat, literally. I stood watch inside the Georgia State Senate chamber as the presiding officer for yet another partisan debate wrapped in emotion, theater and a few facts thrown in from both Democrats and Republicans, members of my party. Last week's divisive debate on election reform directly resulted from the months-long misinformation campaign led by former President Donald J. Trump. The particular legislation being debated was SB202 which was, believe it or not, a much-improved version of election reform compared to several earlier attempts drafted by both the state house and state senate. The most noticeable improvements in the legislation were the removal of language to limit Sunday voting and the elimination of no-excuse absentee ballot voting , which I opposed and was happy to see removed from the final version. The final version also included several Democratic-sponsored ideas including requirements for counties to start processing absentee ballots earlier to minimize post-election confusion and better signage at polling stations. The two-hour debate at times became hard to listen to because of the divisive tones and undertones from both sides. In the height of the debate, I happened to glance to my left in the rostrum and caught a glimpse of the Georgia state flag and was instantly reminded of the pledge we say at the beginning of every legislative day: ""I pledge allegiance to the Georgia Flag and to the principles for which it stands: Wisdom, Justice, and Moderation."" The words ""Wisdom, Justice, and Moderation"" have been a part of our state seal since 1799 because of the time-tested value of each word. I began to imagine what the debate might look like if both sides of the aisle were truly looking through the lens of Wisdom, Justice, and Moderation. If both political sides applied the filter of those three words, they""d be required to think, act and communicate differently with regard to the present conversation around election reform and a growing list of other issues. Georgia election integrity: Baseless stolen election claims don't justify federal takeover with H.R. 1 For Republicans, using that lens would have required them to immediately and unequivocally remove any and all doubt in the public that they think the November election was rigged or stolen in any way shape or form. The phrase, ""former President Donald J. Trump lost fairly"" would need to be said from every channel. It would have also required elected Republicans in politically safe districts to resist the temptation to superficially support knee-jerk reaction legislation, such as not allowing the distribution of water within 150 feet of a polling station or punishing and removing oversight responsibilities from the former president""s scapegoat and popularly-elected statewide official Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, just to appease the extreme right corners of their districts and to avoid potential primary challenges. Unfortunately, Republicans fell into the trap set by the left and allowed them to make the bill into something that it""s not. For Democrats, viewing this debate through the lens of ""Wisdom, Justice, and Moderation"" would have required them to tear up the talking points that have been handed to them from national liberal organizations that are only concerned about shaping the next election outcome and not honestly evaluating proposed election reforms. It would also have also required Democrats to embrace some of the much-needed improvements and modernizations around the absentee ballot processing and verification . Georgia secretary of state: My family voted for Trump. He threw us under the bus anyway. Moving away from the archaic signature match system and simply asking for a voter to handwrite the year they were born and the last four digits of their social security number if they don""t have a driver""s license is not voter suppression, it""s commonsense. Seeing through that principled lens would also require Democrats to use more than someone""s party affiliation to assess the content of their heart. I get it, Republicans have a huge hole to climb out of in the coming years because of the shrapnel created by the 2020 election and its fallout. As Republicans, we must change the tone we use in future elections; conservatism shouldn""t be confused as divisive or mean-spirited. We need genuine empathy so we can understand and reach more voters. And we need to champion conservative causes that can win broad support and restore pillars like fiscal restraint that have crumbled as the GOP has put person over party. I call this approach GOP 2.0 While candidates running on the former president's platform may be afraid of high turnout, those following this better way forward are not. We have faith in our ideas. Republicans don""t need election reform to win back the White House, we need leadership. Geoff Duncan is the lieutenant governor of Georgia."
second_nexus|"After voters delivered Democrats a , in addition to going blue in the , Republican legislators in the state scrambled to implement even more restrictions on access to the ballot box. Late last month, its Republican Governor—Brian Kemp—signed S.B. 202 into law. The legislation requires ID for absentee ballots, limits the number of ballot drop boxes available in each jurisdiction, effectively bans providing voters in long lines with food or water, and introduces a host of other obstacles to vote. The bill became the subject of national outrage, and Republican lawmakers at the national level leapt to further defend their consistent support for voter suppression under the guise of election security. After Major League Baseball announced it was moving its All-Star Game from Atlanta, Georgia to Denver, Colorado in protest of the new law, Republicans tried to call out the league for hypocrisy, falsely claiming that Colorado's voting laws are more restrictive than Georgia's. Scott, who said last month that ""woke supremacy is as bad as white supremacy,"" claimed that ""The Wokes"" were at it again. Dale pointed out that Colorado sends every resident a mail-in ballot, and that the vast majority of its voters cast their ballot by mail. Democratic Senators are currently working to pass the For The People Act—a landmark voting rights bill recently passed by the House that would stem voter suppression laws like the one passed in Georgia. Unsurprisingly, Republican Senators have been vocally opposed to it."
second_nexus|"There is no piece of legislation presently generating more tension and ugly rhetoric than HR1, the ""For the People Act,"" which passed the House and in its Senate form is S1, now pending before the Rules Committee (The designation of ""1"" on each bill was intentional in order to indicate how high a priority this is for Dems). Democrats say that without the law, the GOP will run roughshod over voter rights across the country, as evidenced by the 243 bills in 43 states they have introduced that will in some ways, both big and small, suppress the vote. On Thursday, for example, Governor Kemp of Georgia a sweeping election bill that limits the number of county drop boxes, requires photo ID for mail-in ballots, shortens the time to apply for absentee voting, expands the legislature's power over elections, and makes illegal the providing of food or water by third parties to those waiting in line near a polling station, according to the .  Republicans counter that Democrats are attempting to use their majority in Congress to seize power. McConnell's statement has drawn derision in light of the mountain of suppressive legislation that has already been introduced this year by GOP legislators around the country. But looking past the rhetoric, what are some of the specific objections the GOP has to the bill? Chief among them are the expansions of voter registration and the right of more people to vote, two major goals for Democrats but potentially Armageddon for the GOP. The bill's most controversial provisions automatically register people to vote when they obtain a driver's license, permit same-day voter registration, and extend the franchise to include convicted felons who have already done their time or are serving a probation sentence. The GOP argues that this will lead to a parade of horribles, including the notion that millions of undocumented migrants would be registered illegally. ""Under this bill, there's automatic registration of anybody—if you get a driver's license, if you get a welfare payment, if you get an unemployment payment, if you attend a public university,"" railed Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX). ""Now, everyone knows there are millions of illegal aliens who have driver's licenses, who are getting welfare benefits, who attend public universities…."" Nonsense, say Democrats. The bill does not change any current laws banning non-citizens, including undocumented immigrants, from voting. And while the bill does require every state to adopt an automatic voter registration system, it repeatedly states that only citizens are eligible to be registered. This also isn't terribly new ground. The bill expands on the which already requires state governments to provide simplified voter registration when someone applies for a driver's license or public assistance, with exceptions for states that offer election same-day registration. There's also already a uniform Federal Form to register to vote, in which the applicants affirm, under penalty of perjury, that they are citizens. That requirement would not change. The difference with the new bill is that the enrollment would be automatic unless the applicant declined. The GOP warns that automatic DMV-based voter registration would mean people as young as 16 would now be voting illegally because they will have been registered when they obtained a license. But the law expressly states that, while people over 16 would be registered at the time they applied for a driver's license, they wouldn't be permitted to vote until the legal age of 18, and that the bill has no effect on any state's legal voting age requirement. Again, this isn't a new concept; pre-registration of people younger than 18 already exists in a number of states. Finally, the GOP argues that same-day voter registration would invite fraud. But study after study has shown that there is no evidence anywhere of widespread voter fraud, despite the continued pushing of the Big Lie of a stolen election by President Trump and his allies. Nevertheless, the GOP cites widespread but unfounded allegations of fraud to argue that voter confidence now has to be restored. They claim the imposition of these expansive measures by the federal government does the opposite of that. In their view, voter regulation should be handled by the states. ""We've had a process since the beginning of the country where states and local officials had the flexibility and the ability to make their laws work for voters in their state,"" , the top Republican on the committee overseeing the voting bill. But Democrats point out that when new voting regulations are left to the states, especially those with long histories of voter suppression, the predictable and intended result has been a diminishment of minority voter participation. That was why the Voting Rights Act had to be passed by the federal government in the first place back in 1964, and why it needs to be reauthorized under the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act now. Moreover, they point out, the Constitution expressly gives to Congress the right, under the Elections Clause, to make any law altering the manner of how federal elections are held. With respect to an expansion of the franchise to include former convicts, Senator Cruz took aim at what he knows is an easy target. ""This bill is designed to get criminals to vote,"" Cruz warned. And then in an eerie echo of the Trump campaign's rhetoric, he declared, ""This bill says, 'If you're a murderer, if you're a rapist, if you're a child molester, we the Democrats want you voting.'"" But Democrats point out that the bill does not force any states to give currently incarcerated felons the right to vote (an amendment proposed by progressives to include them failed in the House by a wide margin). It requires, rather, that states allow people who committed felonies in the past to vote once they are no longer incarcerated. The GOP has spent much money and effort lately trying to block such laws from taking effect, the most recent in Florida where, even after the public voted by referendum to allow former felons to vote, the state imposed additional requirements that thwarted this, including the prerequisite that all civil penalties be repaid first, a kind of modern poll tax. So what's really going on? Seen broadly, the GOP is attacking automatic registration because it really does work to get more traditionally underrepresented voters registered. Already, 17 states and the District of Columbia have automatic voter registration in place. In Michigan, for example, that recently led to around a 15 percent rise in daily voter registrations processed by the Secretary of State's office in the two-week period immediately following the implementation of the new law, according to a . It's numbers like these that have the GOP very worried. Thus, the GOP is leaning heavily into fear-based rhetoric to stop the bill, doubling down on the idea that undocumented immigrants would be voting because it has already trained its base to believe this, even though there is no evidence this ever happens. Senator Cruz similarly targets and smears convicts because he knows it taps into an irrational fear of dangerous, mostly minority voters. The GOP must also be worried that it might not succeed at stopping automatic voter registration by way of court challenges. Arizona tried to enforce a law, for example, that required officials to reject the Federal Form for voter registration if it was not accompanied by documentary proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate. This ran counter to the National Voter Registration Law's more liberal requirements. The case went all the way up to the Supreme Court, where the Court ruled against the state in . In a 7-2 decision written by none other than the late Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court held that the NVRA's mandate that states ""accept and use"" the Federal Form preempted Arizona's additional documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement. That's bad news for the GOP should HR1/S1 pass and be signed into law. But what are its chances? Majority Leader Schumer has said that ""failure isn't an option"" on this law, but success can take many watered-down forms. All eyes are now on how to get the bill past the 60-vote filibuster hurdle that otherwise would doom it. There are 49 Democrat co-sponsors of the bill in the Senate. The only Democrat who has not signed on to it is, predictably, Senator Joe Manchin (R-WV). He has indicated that he wants parts of the law changed before he will back it, but he hasn't indicated which provisions he opposes. Senator Manchin also presently insists that the bill receive bipartisan support, but that isn't likely at all in its current form, leaving its fate very much up in the air."
second_nexus|"In their eagerness to suppress minority votes, in particular the surge of Democratic voters who used mail-in ballots for the first time in 2020 due to the pandemic, Republican lawmakers in Florida rushed to that placed obstacles in the path of absentee voting. This included a requirement that anyone who wants to vote by mail needs to re-register every election cycle, meaning every two years. It also drastically curtailed the number of ballot drop boxes in every county. The party's calculus was fairly straightforward: The new law will force many minorities to vote in-person, probably in long lines, whether during early voting or on Election Day, and therefore fewer will cast ballots. But could this plan backfire? Many Republicans who use mail-in ballots are elderly or are military personnel. A substantial number of them may not realize that they have to re-apply for their 2022 mail-in ballots, wrongly assuming they had just done so in 2020. Over the past two decades, the GOP has invested millions of dollars in voter education and outreach as Florida's electorate shifted to mail-in balloting. They targeted senior and military voters about how to use absentee ballots and to get them used to it. In this effort, they succeeded wildly, with GOP voters taking advantage of mail-in voting far more than Democrats all the way up to the 2020 election. The new law requiring reapplication before 2022, however, may cause many of these GOP voters to miss the new deadlines and force them to vote in person—a practice to which many are unaccustomed. On the other hand, Democrats—particularly minority voters—are quite used to voting in person and to the long wait times this often entails. When President Obama carried the state in 2008, mainly through a get-out-the-vote campaign that took advantage of early voting, the GOP predictably responded by curtailing early voting, resulting in six- or seven-hour long waits during the 2012 election. that over 200,000 people did not vote in that election because of those wait times. After polls showed 70 percent of Floridians wanted early voting expanded because of these wait times, the legislature relented and reversed itself. Before the pandemic struck, Democrats tried for years to expand mail-in voting to avoid these types of shenanigans from the GOP, but there was strong resistance among their voters, mostly because many minorities understandably distrust the system and wanted to see their ballots handed in and accepted in person. With the passage of the new bill, many Democrats intuitively understand that once again the system is trying to suppress their right to vote, and they could return in big numbers for in-person Early and Election Day voting. Meanwhile, and especially for an off-year election, many elderly and military GOP voters may find a surprise when they aren't automatically re-approved to vote by mail. The that many GOP operatives were actually afraid to publicly voice concerns about the bill backfiring for fear of inviting anger from their own supporters and party leadership. One GOP source, who preferred to remain anonymous, told the Post, ""Now, you'll have military personnel who might not think they have to request a ballot who won't get it. And we've got senior voters who have health concerns or just don't want to go out. They might not know the law has changed, and they might not get a ballot, because they're not engaged."" Add to that Trump's damaging and enduring rhetoric that the 2020 election was fraudulent and stolen from him, and many of his own base may mentally check out of the 2022 midterms, especially with their leader not on the ticket. Indeed, we saw this play out in the Georgia special election in January: As , turnout among Trump-leaning Northern Georgia counties fell by far more than Biden-leaning urban ones, either because Trump was not on the ballot or because he continued to message that the election was rigged and caused his own base to stay home as a result. Efforts such as Florida's new voter suppression law were intended in part to reassure GOP voters that elections going forward will be fair and fraud-free. After all, thanks to misinformation from Trump and the GOP itself, some 70 percent of GOP voters still believe the Big Lie about a stolen election. It would be truly ironic if GOP-controlled states like Florida were so intent on blunting new Democratic voting patterns that they inadvertently disenfranchise whole swathes of their own voters through new restrictions. In the end, with mail-in voting taking a hit, Democrats will likely still turn up in person to vote in Florida. Whether elderly GOP voters do the same remains to be seen."
second_nexus|The typically red state of went blue in the this year for the first time since 1992, and just a few months later delivered victories in a pair of key runoffs in Georgia that endowed Democrats with a razor-thin Senate majority. Following their statewide losses, Georgia's Republican legislature swiftly passed , an elections bill designed to limit access to the ballot box, especially for Georgia's Black voters, whose turnout was a key factor in the elections' outcomes. The GOP legislators presented the measure under the guise of election security. The bill, which was signed into law by Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp, requires ID to cast an absentee ballot, limits the number of ballot drop boxes in each jurisdiction, effectively bans giving food or water to voters in long lines, and introduces a host of other restrictions that critics say amounts to one of the most blatant voter suppression tactics since the Jim Crow era. The bill's passage faced widespread outcry from Democratic lawmakers, private citizens, and now, one of Georgia's biggest corporations. Delta Airlines, headquartered in the state's capital of Atlanta, contributed around $300 million to state and local governments in Georgia through taxes and fees in 2018. But the company's CEO—Ed Bastian—issued a against the new law. He concluded with a promise that Delta would be working with voting rights advocates in Georgia to help offset the law's consequences. That very week, Georgia Republican lawmakers—in the last hours of the legislative session—attempted to punish the company for making public its stance on the bill. But Delta's stance, though unequivocal, wasn't necessarily commendable to Georgia voters whom the law affects. For weeks before the bill's passage, Georgia voting rights advocates implored large Georgia-based companies—especially Delta—to publicly condemn the bill. The United States Senate is currently considering the For The People Act—a landmark voting rights bill recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. Its passage would expand protections for voters in the face of laws like S.B. 202, but with the 60 vote threshold imposed by the Senate filibuster still in effect, its passage is unlikely.
second_nexus|Thanks to the tireless work of voting rights activists like , the state of Georgia went blue in the , and in January of this year, it delivered , giving Democrats a razor thin majority in the body. Despite former President Donald Trump's pressure on state legislatures and on local officials in Georgia, the state submitted its electoral votes, officially going blue for the first time since 1992. Determined not to see the state go blue again, Republicans in Georgia are scrambling to suppress the votes of as many people as possible, especially in communities of color. And on Thursday afternoon, Georgia's Republican legislature passed a broad measure to limit voting by mail, limits ballot drop boxes, expands the power of the state legislature over elections, forbids bringing food or water to voters in long lines, and other twisted limitations on the people's votes. Hours later, Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp—who himself —signed the bill into law. But as Kemp was signing it, State Representative Park Cannon knocked on his door to voice her opposition—only to be arrested by Georgia police. After Cannon gently but insistently knocked, the police grabbed her by the arms and dragged her to their vehicle. Because Georgia law prohibits legislators from being arrested during a session except for treason or felony, Cannon was reportedly charged with two felonies. The Senate is currently considering the For The People Act, a massive voting rights bill passed by the House, which would limit the ability of states to suppress their voters. Georgia's law has demonstrated the necessity of this bill, but it will take a bypass of the 60 vote threshold imposed by the filibuster to have a chance of passing.
second_nexus|"Republicans are crying "" "" again after a slate of corporations decried state-level proposals to limit access to the ballot box, like 's S.B. 202, which was recently signed into law by its Republican Governor Brian Kemp. The new law, which limits the number of ballot drop boxes in each jurisdiction and effectively bans providing food or water to voters in long lines, sparked widespread public outcry, prompting companies like Delta and Major League Baseball to publicly speak out against the bill. Republican Senator of Missouri invoked this corporate backlash in his unveiling of new legislation designed to curb the political power of America's richest companies. Hawley introduced the Trust-Busting For the 21st Century Act, which would ban acquisitions of smaller companies by companies worth more than $100 billion. He noted a recent virtual meeting of 100 corporations to discuss paths forward in the face of the numerous voter suppression bills sprouting up across the country under the guise of ""election integrity."" In an appearance with white nationalist Fox News host , Hawley claimed the public was living in fear of being ""canceled"" by corporations. Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) have long defended the so-called freedom of corporations to donate hundreds of thousands to political action committees funding their campaigns. The Senate is currently considering the For the People Act, a landmark voting rights bill that would push back against state legislation to suppress the vote, but the 60 vote threshold imposed by the Senate filibuster makes its passage highly unlikely for the time being."
second_nexus|After weaponizing voter suppression to win his gubernatorial race in 2018, Georgia Republican Governor Brian Kemp signed it into law on Thursday. Thanks to the tireless work of activists like Stacey Abrams, Democrats saw sweeping victories in Georgia, which went blue for the first time since 1992 in this past presidential election, and delivered a pair of key victories that gave Democrats a narrow majority in the U.S. Senate. As a result, Georgia's Republican legislature scrambled to pass an omnibus designed to limit the ability of likely-Democratic voters to cast their ballots, especially voters of color. The bill, which Kemp signed on Thursday, expands voter ID demands, criminalizes giving food or water to voters in long lines, and limits the availability of ballot drop boxes for absentee ballots, an oft-used method of ballot delivery for those who are unable to vote in person due to age, disability, or immovable commitments. If Kemp's determination to suppress the voices of Georgians wasn't enough, his hypocrisy on the issue of ballot drop boxes became even more infuriating in light of a resurfaced video. The video, ironically encouraging his Twitter followers to vote, shows Kemp delivering his 2020 election ballot to a drop off box. Ballot boxes were one of the primary targets in former President Donald Trump's effort to subvert the results of the 2020 election, which he lost to now-President Joe Biden. Trump claimed ballot boxes in places like Pennsylvania were a source of non-existent widespread fraud. This led his supporters to begin monitoring them and intimidating election workers who collected them. The bill Kemp renders drop boxes only available outside of polling locations and usable only during regular voting hours. The Senate is currently considering the For The People Act, a massive voting rights bill passed by the House, which would limit the ability of states to suppress their voters. Georgia's law has demonstrated the necessity of this bill, but it will take a bypass of the 60 vote threshold imposed by the filibuster to have a chance of passing.
second_nexus|"With two grand juries now looking into efforts by former President Donald Trump and his campaign to illegally influence the Georgia elections, attention has been turning to one state law in Georgia that could land both the president and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in trouble. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is looking into a provision in Georgia law that makes it a crime, punishable by at least one and up to five years in prison, for making false statements to government officials. Title 16 (Crimes and Offenses) of the Georgia Code covers such false statements and makes it illegal to This statute might be relevant to the ongoing investigations and the three cases referred to Willis's office by the Georgia Secretary of State. Two specific instances are likely top of mind for prosecutors. First, during his phone call to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, former President Trump made numerous false claims in order to urge Raffensperger to ""find 11,780 votes"" and overturn the election results. Per the , which first broke the story, Trump walked through a laundry list of disinformation and conspiracy theories during the infamous, recorded call. These included statements that thousands of dead people had voted, that an Atlanta election worker scanned 18,000 forged ballots three times each with ""100 percent"" for Biden, and that thousands of voters living outside of Georgia came back just to vote against him illegally. None of these was in any way true, and all had been debunked by Georgia state election officials. For his part, Rudy Giuliani went before Republican House members of the Georgia state legislature and claimed there was a video showing election workers taking votes out of suitcases and accused them of ""passing dope, not just ballots,"" according to . Echoing statements by former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell, Giuliani claimed that the state had counted 96,000 ""phantom votes"" and then proceeded to parade discredited witnesses to give oxygen to the idea that voting machines were compromised. Giuliani's exposure under the ""false statements"" law in Georgia might have particular salience, as he was far more brazen than the ex-president in his wild assertions, and Trump has always been careful to leave a bit of plausible deniability. The toughest part might be proving that Trump and Giuliani actually knew that their wild claims were false. After all, most of the people who subscribe to the Big Lie actually believe there was widespread election fraud and that the results are illegitimate. We are learning that this appears to include those whom the former president incited to storm the Capitol. And Trump and Giuliani have always at least made a good showing that they believe their own lies. But the former president's legal team will have to walk an interesting tightrope in the weeks ahead. To defend against the defamation actions brought by Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic, they may choose to hide behind the First Amendment and claim that they had a right to assert even the wildest of claims, even ones which no reasonable person would accept as fact, just as Sidney Powell's lawyers have . This would seem to cut against the notion that the defendants believed the conspiracies they were promoting were in fact true. All of this shows that our legal system isn't set up very well to punish people who recklessly spread misinformation, even to government officials. If the standard here were set higher to include a reckless disregard for the truth—what comprises ""actual malice"" in the eyes of the Supreme Court—then the case would be stronger, but it might then arguably run into First Amendment issues. Where do you draw the line between asserting something as important as possible election fraud and reckless dissemination of false conspiracies? It always falls back to what the truth really is, and what reasonable people would know it to be. As things stand, in order not to undercut the Big Lie, the defendants likely will assert that the statements were in fact true and they are standing by their claims, which means that even after the facts are proven to be false, they can still claim they did not ""knowingly and willfully"" make untrue claims to any government officials. But there are still two problems with this defense. First is the chance, however small, that there is a smoking gun, in the form of testimony or a written or recorded communication, revealing the team knew that the lies and conspiracies they were promoting were false but did it anyway. Prosecutors understand that they will have to get at least one member of the team to cooperate in order to produce such testimony or such evidence, so they will begin to lean on them to see if there are weaknesses. Both Powell and erstwhile ""kraken"" lawyer Lin Wood are estranged from the former president and his team and in many ways were left out in the cold, so there may be opportunities there. Second, if the claims about dead or out-of-state voters and illegally stuffing ballot boxes were true ,as they state, then why didn't the Trump campaign include the wildest ones in their court filings and argue them with the same gusto that they presented before the Georgia House members? A jury could infer from this that Giuliani knew that he was putting on false political theater with his hearings, but that he had no leg to stand on in Court with the claims, where he could be sanctioned for such a filing or argument. That could lead the jury to conclude he knew precisely what he was doing and did in fact violate the Georgia statute prohibiting false statements to government officials. The grand juries in Georgia will begin subpoenaing documents around the alleged election interference, and we can expect they likely will result in some indictments. Under what statutes, against whom, and with what possible penalties remains to be seen."

Despite the national outcry Georgia's bill prompted, it's since inspired the state of Florida—which went red in the 2020 presidential election. , a bill introduced last week by Florida Republicans, would expand existing laws prohibiting campaigning within 100 feet of a polling place to forbid the giving of ""any item"" to any voter within 150 feet, defining such as ""solicitation."" It's an all too familiar sight in U.S. elections for voters to be stuck waiting for hours in line, usually due to a lack of polling places. Limits on giving sustenance to voters in these lines, many of whom are elderly, could force Americans to choose between exercising their right to vote or remaining safely hydrated. After former President Donald Trump's constant lies about the validity of the 2020 election, Republicans insist that the United States needs expanded ""election security"" measures, though no evidence of widespread voter fraud exists. Critics say Republicans are using election security as a facade to limit access of likely-Democratic voters to the ballot box. The Senate is currently considering the For The People Act—a landmark voting rights bill that would expand access to the ballot box across the nation, but with the 60 vote threshold imposed by the Senate filibuster, it's unclear how it could possibly pass."
