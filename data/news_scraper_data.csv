blaze|" The lieutenant governor of North Carolina, the first black man to hold that office, excoriated arguments from Democrats that compare voter integrity measures such as the new law passed in Georgia to racist voter suppression laws of the Jim Crow south.   On Thursday, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson (R) testified at a hearing in the House of Representatives titled, ""Oversight of the Voting Rights Act: The Evolving Landscape of Voting Discrimination."" In his opening remarks, he said it was ""insane"" and ""insulting"" for anyone to compare the voter ID laws passed in Georgia and other states to Jim Crow laws that were used to tyrannize black Americans and keep them from voting. ""My people were put in the belly of ships, bound by chains, and endured the middle passage. My people were whipped, beaten, and sold as property. In Reconstruction and throughout Jim Crow, black people were intimidated, harassed, and even killed to keep them from having a voice in government,"" Robinson told House lawmakers. ""Symbols like chains, nooses, and burnt crosses are not just symbols of death, they are symbols of forced and coerced silence.   ""The sacrifices of our ancestors so I could have the opportunity to become the first black lieutenant governor of my state, to see a black man sit in the White House, and for millions of us to be leaders in business, athletics, and culture is incredible,"" he continued. Turning to the Georgia law, which Democrats have accused of implementing ""Jim Crow in 2021"" by suppressing the minority vote, Robinson demanded to know how black voices were being silenced or kept out of the political process. ""How? By fear of a noose or chains? To be fired from work? To be ostracized by their communities? No. A free ID to vote. Let me say that again, a free ID to vote,"" he said. He continued: Later in the hearing, Robinson made it clear that historically it was the Republican Party that supported voting rights for black Americans and the Democratic Party that supported voter suppression and Jim Crow. ""That history is clear who stood on which side at every turn in history. It is clear, it's not even in dispute,"" Robinson said. ""What we want is integrity, we don't want power. We want integrity."" He also defended Republican-supported voter ID laws as ""simple American responsibility"" and reminded the Congress that Jim Crow laws ""wasn't just a poll tax."" ""You stepped outside the line during Jim Crow, you'd find yourself swinging from a tree,"" he said. Robinson called voter ID ""common sense legislation for the common good."" ""To say that somehow poor people, black people can't be involved in that responsibility, again, is insulting,"" he said."
blaze|" Failed gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams on Tuesday repeated her false claims that the 2018 race for governor in Georgia was ""stolen"" while testifying at a Senate hearing on voting rights.   Abrams was enlisted by Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats as the star witness for their hearing, ""Jim Crow 2021: The Latest Assault on the Right to Vote,"" which examined the new election reforms adopted by Georgia last month. Democrats, including Abrams and President Joe BIden, have accused Georgia Republicans of reintroducing ""Jim Crow,"" claiming the Georgia law makes it harder for blacks and other minorities to vote — a charge Republicans vehemently deny. At the hearing, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) grilled Abrams on whether she still believes the 2018 race for governor was stolen from her, noting that she never conceded the race to Gov. Brian Kemp (R). ""It's been over two years, and you still refuse to concede that you lost the race for governor in Georgia in 2018,"" Cruz said. ""Yes or no, today, do you still maintain that the 2018 Georgia election was stolen?""   ""As I have always said, I acknowledged at the very beginning that Brian Kemp won under the rules in place. What I object to are rules that permitted thousands of Georgia voters to be denied their participation in this election, to have their votes cast out. And so I will continue to disagree with the system until it is fixed,"" Abrams replied. But Cruz pressed her to answer a ""yes or no"" question on whether she still maintains the 2018 election was stolen. ""My full language was that it was stolen from the voters of Georgia. We do not know what they would have done because not every eligible Georgian was able to participate fully in the election,"" she argued. Following up, Cruz reminded Abrams that she previously told the New York Times that her loss ""was fully attributable to voter suppression."" ""Ms. Abrams, do you know in Georgia whether the percentage of African American Georgians who are registered to vote and who turned out to vote is it higher or lower than the national average?"" he asked. Abrams admitted ""it is higher than the national average because Georgia's one of the largest states with an African American population."" Cruz noted that the percentage of black people registered to vote in Georgia in 2018 was 64.7%, higher than the national average of 60.2%. He said that the percentage of Georgians who voted in 2018 was 56.3%, higher than the national average of 48%. ""Let me ask you this, Ms. Abrams,"" Cruz continued. ""In 2018, do you know which demographic group in Georgia had the highest registration percentage and the highest turnout percentage?"" ""I have a guess but I will defer to you for the answer,"" Abrams responded. ""The answer is African Americans had the highest registration and the highest turnout despite your claiming that the election was stolen and that there was somehow voter suppression,"" Cruz informed her."
blaze|" Nearly two dozen civil rights leaders and black conservatives have stepped up to defend Georgia's much-maligned voting law against inaccurate criticisms that the new law is racist and akin to ""Jim Crow in the 21st century,"" the Daily Signal reported.   In a letter sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, several prominent black leaders — including Heritage Foundation President Kay James and former Ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Commission Ken Blackwell — blasted what they called a ""despicable smear campaign"" against the law. ""It has become clear that even well-intentioned critics of the law simply have no idea what the law is,"" the letter stated in reference to repeated lies about the law peddled by a litany of Democratic political figures, including President Joe Biden. Last month, Biden earned ""Four Pinocchios"" from Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler over his repeated claims that the law ""ends voting hours early so working people can't cast their vote after their shift is over."" The president also called the law racist, saying it ""makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle.""   ""It is clear they have no idea how favorably Georgia's new law compares with most other states — including President Biden's home state of Delaware,"" the letter went on. ""And it is clear they have no idea that a majority of Black voters across the country support the key provision under attack by critics — the simple requirement that voters be able to identify themselves when voting."" The civil rights leaders also took a deliberate shot at Major League Baseball and Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines for their protests of the reforms, saying, ""This is the same simple requirement needed to pick up baseball tickets or board a plane — activities hardly as important as voting."" Last month, the MLB opted to move its annual All-Star game out of Georgia in protest over the new law. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian protested as well, wrongly claiming the law ""could make it harder for many Georgians, particularly those in our Black and Brown communities, to exercise their right to vote."" The Daily Signal noted that the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, planned to hold a hearing Tuesday morning, titled, ""Jim Crow 2021: The Latest Assault on the Right to Vote."" The hearing featured testimonies from progressive newly elected Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock (D), controversial former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, and Republican Rep. Burgess Owens (Utah), among others. During the hearing, Owens shamed Biden and other Democrats over their ""absolutely outrageous"" comparison of the new law to Jim Crow laws of the old segregationist South."
blaze|" Is opposing voter ID racist? Steven Crowder thinks so and decided to visit Southern Methodist University in Dallas to see what students had to say.   In this clip, Crowder sat down with Isabell, a student who came ""prepared"" with statistics for why she believes voter ID is racist. Crowder swiftly debunked Isabell's stats with some information of his own. Things got interesting when Crowder directed Isabell's attention toward her own racism. ""You think that minorities don't have access to voter identification ... you assume minorities can't afford identification ... you believe that minorities can't afford ID and can't procure ID. ...

blaze|" Rep. Burgess Owens (R-Utah) on Tuesday shamed President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party for their ""absolutely outrageous"" comparison of Georgia's new election law to Jim Crow laws of the old segregationist South.   ""I grew up in the era of actual, legalized, institutional racism. I grew up in the deep South in Tallahassee, Florida, in the 1960s during the days of KKK, Jim Crow, and segregation,"" Owens testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""As someone who has actually experienced Jim Crow laws, I'd like to set the record straight on the myths regarding the recently passed Georgia state law and why any comparison between this law and Jim Crow is absolutely outrageous."" The congressman was a witness for the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing on voting rights titled, ""Jim Crow 2021: The Latest Assault on the Right to Vote."" The hearing also featured failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams — who continues to falsely assert that the 2018 gubernatorial election was stolen — Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), and NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund President Sherrilyn Ifill, each of whom asserted that the Georgia law is part of an ongoing assault by Republicans on the right of black Americans to vote.   Owens strongly disagreed and used his testimony to dispel the idea that Georgia's law is racist or in any way, shape, or form reminiscent of Jim Crow laws. He told the committee that when he was a child, his father allowed him to join a protest outside a segregated theater where black people were not allowed to enter. He described segregated service stations with restrooms designated for white men, white women, and ""colored"" people. Owens also referred to Jim Crow laws like poll taxes, property tests, literacy tests, and ""violence and intimidation at the polls"" that ""made it nearly impossible for black Americans to vote"" as part of his lived experience. In contrast, Owens said Georgia's election law simply establishes a new requirement for a person voting absentee to provide a form of voter identification. This requirement, ""which has brought so much outrage from the left,"" is met with an ID card, bank statement, paycheck, government check, utility bill, or any other government documentation with a voter's name and address, Owens explained. He also pointed out that 97% of Georgia voters already have ID and noted that even if voters fail to provide one of those documents, they may still fill out provisional ballots. ""What I find extremely offensive is the narrative from the left that black people are not smart enough, not educated enough, not desirous enough for education to do what every other culture and race does in this country — get an ID,"" declared Owens.

blaze|" Activists in Georgia are demanding a new boycott of Home Depot, not over something the company said or did, but precisely because they believe the home improvement retail store did not disavow Georgia new election law with strong enough language.   Critics of Georgia's voting law — which has been the subject of rampant misinformation — claim the law makes voting more difficult. Supporters of the law, however, say the law was necessary to improve election integrity and have noted that many other states have enacted similar provisions. With building pressure from activists, and such claims from President Joe Biden that the law is ""Jim Crow in the 21st century,"" many major corporations spoke out against the law, and Major League Baseball even moved its All-Star game from Georgia over growing pressure to address the law. The Coca-Cola Company and Delta Air Lines — two companies whose headquarters are located in Atlanta — denounced the bill. Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said his company ""does not support this legislation,"" citing claims that it makes voting more difficult, while Delta CEO Ed Bastian called the law ""unacceptable and does not match Delta's values.""   Home Depot also addressed the law, saying, ""We believe that all elections should be accessible, fair and secure and support broad voter participation. We'll continue to work to ensure our associates, both in Georgia and across the country, have the information and resources to vote."" According to the New York Times, a coalition of black faith leaders are demanding a boycott of Home Depot because they believe the company ""abdicated its responsibility as a good corporate citizen by not pushing back on the state's new voting law."" Bishop Reginald Jackson, who leads all 534 African Methodist Episcopal churches in the Peach State, claimed Home Depot ""demonstrated an indifference, a lack of response to the call, not only from clergy, but a call from other groups to speak out in opposition to this legislation.""

blaze|" ""Hillbilly Elegy"" author J.D. Vance accused Bloomberg, the Washington Post, and numerous other media outlets of shaping a false narrative about his exit from the board of an agricultural tech company as he contemplates a run for U.S. Senate in Ohio.   Vance, a 36-year-old venture capitalist, on Wednesday resigned from the board of Kentucky-based tomato-grower AppHarvest. He was an early investor in the company and a member of the board of directors. Bloomberg first reported and various news reports subsequently claimed that he resigned after sending ""controversial tweets"" that criticized corporations for opposing Republican-supported election integrity laws passed in Georgia and proposed elsewhere in the nation. Vance had tweeted that corporations that oppose the GOP laws should have their taxes raised or ""whatever else is necessary to fight these goons."" Axios later reported that Vance had announced his intention to resign on March 22, well before sending the tweets in question, telling the board he was likely to run for Senate and did not want the company to become politicized.   On Friday, Vance issued a lengthy thread on Twitter disputing the narrative that he left AppHarvest because of his tweets, explaining his reasons for exiting the company, and condemning the media for false reporting. ""Alright, here's a story about how the media often shapes narratives instead of reporting the truth, and how a small untruth can morph into a lie that's repeated again and again throughout the media bubble,"" Vance tweeted. He explained that as AppHarvest has become a successful publicly-traded company, his ""ability to be useful"" is ""limited."" ""I'm thinking about a political run, and whatever I do politically, I hate the insane reigning political orthodoxy,"" Vance said. ""So last month, I started talking with other members of the board about stepping down. The basic thinking was: I'm going to keep speaking my mind, and I'd rather do that unconstrained by the demands of a public board. And I thought the company would be better off too. ""Now, do I think this is unfair? Yes. Do I think progressive board members at public companies are worried about their viewpoints affecting their companies? Obviously not, and the last few weeks have shown everyone: corporate America is totally in the tank for the left,"" he stated, appearing to refer to the united corporate statement signed by hundreds of CEOs expressing opposition to Georgia's new voting law and ""any discriminatory legislation"" that progressives claim would restrict ballot access. Vance said that this ""marriage between the left and corporate power"" requires ""political intervention"" and that he did not want to drag AppHarvest into a political fight. So Vance resigned from AppHarvest's board on April 9 and his resignation went into effect on Monday April 12. ""On April 13, Bloomberg's [Deena Shanker] posted a story that said Appharvest announced my departure 'in response' to a Bloomberg inquiry about my 'controversial statements.' I was only asked for comment 'via LinkedIn,' which is kind of like asking me for comment through MySpace,"" Vance recounted. ""The clear implication is that I was forced down because of my tweets. The only problem? The two 'controversial' tweets were posted on April 9, at 3:58, and on April 12. In other words, I resigned before I sent the tweets. And the suggestion that I was forced down is absurd,"" he said. ""I've seen this lie repeated in any number of media outlets, from local Louisville and Cincinnati papers to national outlets like the Washington Post. But let me just say again: the idea that I was forced out of Appharvest because of some tweets is obviously untrue. It is a lie. ""This is how too many in our press operate, and it's why the media is one of the least trusted institutions in society: Gin up a story, run it without proper sourcing, and let it run through multiple outlets. To everyone that's run this lie: please do your stealth edits."" Bloomberg's original report was corrected on April 16 to remove a reference to Vance's tweets in the headline and adjust the grammar in the paragraph that originally claimed Vance exited AppHarvest ""in response"" to an inquiry from Bloomberg about his tweets. Vance is openly considering a bid for the U.S. Senate seat that will be vacated by retiring Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio)."

On the radio program this week, Glenn Beck explained how this government-corporation partnership is not only proof of fascism, but it is also demonstrative of how our lives will be under The Great Reset: government and large corporations will work together to set the rules, and the freedoms of the individual American will be squashed. ""I want you to understand ... everything that they have ever said about, 'oh, it's a conspiracy theory' about The Great Reset, you can throw that in the garbage now,"" Glenn began.

blaze|" Actor Will Smith along with director Antoine Fuqua announced they are moving production of their upcoming film ""Emancipation"" out of Georgia in protest of the state's ""regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access,"" Deadline reported.   The outlet cited a Monday statement from the production companies headed by Smith and Fuqua explaining their reasons for exiting Georgia: ""At this moment in time, the Nation is coming to terms with its history and is attempting to eliminate vestiges of institutional racism to achieve true racial justice. We cannot in good conscience provide economic support to a government that enacts regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access. The new Georgia voting laws are reminiscent of voting impediments that were passed at the end of Reconstruction to prevent many Americans from voting. Regrettably, we feel compelled to move our film production work from Georgia to another state."" But the law merely ramps up security for Georgia's elections by requiring photo IDs for mail-in ballots, and it even expands early voting hours. Yet it's been almost universally criticized by the left and has fallen victim to their false attacks.   For example, President Joe Biden earned ""Four Pinocchios"" from the Washington Post for saying the law ""ends voting hours early so working people can't cast their vote."" And the paper added that Georgia's far-left U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock signed on to a third-party email that contained false information about the voting law.   "
blaze|" Newly elected Georgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock is in hot water this week after it was revealed that he signed onto a third-party email that contained blatantly false information about his state's new voting law.   The Washington Post reported on Monday that the progressive lawmaker, who was elected to the Senate in the state's Jan. 5 runoffs, ""signed an email sent out by the advocacy group 3.14 Action after the law passed, which claimed it ended no-excuse mail voting and restricted early voting on the weekends"" — both of which were early proposals that ultimately didn't make it into the law. The outlet added that a spokesperson for the senator claimed Warnock signed off on the email days before the law was passed when the aforementioned provisions were still under consideration. But that claim is obfuscated by the fact that the email was sent several days after the bill became law.   According to Fox News, the email was sent on March 30, five days after Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed the bill into law. Either way, the imaging is bad, Hot Air noted in its coverage of the news. ""Which possibility is worse?"" the outlet asked. ""That Warnock knew an activist group's email which he endorsed was full of lies and endorsed it anyway because it was effective propaganda for his cause? Or that the substance of Georgia's law is so irrelevant to prefab Democratic demagoguery about 'Jim Crow 2.0' that Warnock just didn't care if the email was accurate or not?""' The law — which aims to further secure state elections by requiring a photo ID for mail-in ballots and actually expands early voting hours — has been the subject of fierce scrutiny and numerous false attacks by Democratic politicians and media organizations since its introduction in the state legislature. Last month, President Joe Biden earned ""Four Pinocchios"" from Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler for twice repeating a lie that the law ""ends voting hours early so working people can't cast their vote."" The president's statement was a complete reversal of the truth, which is that the law expands voting hours and days for early voting. Biden has also on several occasions chosen to characterize the law as the ""new Jim Crow"" and earlier this month backed calls demanding that Major League Baseball move its All-Star Game out of the state.

slate| When Gov. Brian Kemp signed Georgia’s new restrictive voting provisions into law, he claimed the controversial changes—including making it harder to request mail ballots and use drop boxes—are necessary to improve election security. These bills, of course, spring from the Big Lie about our elections, but there is another irony here. Much of the “election integrity” legislation in Georgia and around the country would actually weaken our election systems and reduce their capacity to recover from a technological problem, whether a malfunction or an attack. During the 2020 election, the increased variety in voting methods and the longer time frame for voting meant that, in many states, election officials were handling smaller groups of voters and ballots at once than they were in past elections. If a technological problem arose, the reduced crowds made it easier to diagnose and solve the problem and get voters voting again. For example, during early voting in 2020, Georgia’s statewide voter registration database was having trouble handling the logins of election staff across the state. The problem caused extremely long lines. Georgia officials weren’t able to fix it immediately, but within a few days the issue was addressed, lines improved, and voters who might have not been able to stand in long lines because of work or other obligations still had opportunities to cast their ballot. If there had only been one or two days for in-person voting, those voters might not have had another chance. And the lines would have been even longer, with many more voters showing up to cast their ballot at once. Many of the so-called election integrity bills would reduce the availability of ballot drop boxes—one bill in Florida would eliminate them entirely. During the 2020 election, drop boxes were a convenient voting option for many people who might have been concerned about the reliability of the post office: Voters could drop their absentee ballot into a nearby box instead of showing up to polling places on Election Day. This helped reduce the lines at polling places for those voters who preferred or needed the in-person option instead. Drop boxes helped all voters—absentee and in-person—by making sure they didn’t all show up to the polling place on Election Day, which would have made it harder for poll workers to deal with inevitable technical problems or cyberattacks. Even if fears of delays with the postal system subside in the future, cyberattacks or staffing cuts could result in slow mail service, or election officials could have trouble processing ballot requests quickly, leading to delays in voters receiving their ballots in time to mail them back. Drop boxes will help ensure the resiliency of the system. And finally, bills being introduced attacking same-day voter registration undermine the recovery capabilities these systems provide for two of the biggest vulnerabilities in U.S. elections: voter registration databases and electronic poll books. Many of them—including in Georgia—are not formally certified to any security standards. This makes them more vulnerable to cyberattacks or breakdowns. When registration is required in order to be eligible to vote, attacks on the registration lists can have a devastating effect, impeding the ability of election workers to check in voters at polling places or process their mail ballots. Same-day registration is a fail-safe—even if the list is compromised, voters can register on the day they show up to vote and cast their ballots. While the push to restrict voting and undermine election security is disheartening, the crush of new bills—as of March 24, legislators had introduced 361 bills with restrictive provisions in 47 states—has pushed Congress to take action. The House passed the For the People Act, which includes crucial election reforms, and the bill has been introduced in the Senate. The For the People Act would create a national standard for voting access and security by, among other things, ensuring minimum requirements for early voting, voting by mail, drop boxes, and same-day registration. The bill would have other election security benefits, including replacing insecure paperless voting machines (which are still used in seven states) and promoting postelection audits to build confidence in results. The For the People Act would cancel out many of the worst restrictions on voting access that have been introduced or become law. But can it pass through the Senate and reverse these regressive efforts? There are certainly real challenges. Senate Democratic leaders are on record saying the filibuster cannot be an impediment to its passage. But even before they figure that out, they must get Democratic holdout Sen. Joe Manchin on board. He says he supports many of the bill’s provisions but would prefer to find a bipartisan solution. Given how far apart the two sides are, a major compromise seems dubious. None of this means the bill can’t pass. Indeed, the brazen attempts by state lawmakers to undermine voting rights—and consequently election security—just might force the hands of both Manchin and Congress into passing For the People Act, resulting in a long overdue national baseline for voter access and election security.
slate| Shortly after a group of Black business executives called on corporate America to do more in pushing back against restrictive voting bills making their way through state legislatures, a handful of Georgia’s highest-profile companies took stronger public stands against the state’s recently passed voting law. The state is home to a host of America’s biggest companies—including Coca-Cola, Delta Air Lines, Home Depot, and Aflac—all of which are facing criticism for not being more vocal in opposition to the Georgia voting bill, which was signed into law last week after weeks of winding its way through the state Legislature. On Wednesday, two of the state’s biggest companies, Delta and Coca-Cola, issued more forceful denunciations of the new law. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian addressed the issue in a memo to employees. “Last week, the Georgia legislature passed a sweeping voting reform act that could make it harder for many Georgians, particularly those in our Black and Brown communities, to exercise their right to vote,” Bastian’s memo said. “The entire rationale for this bill was based on a lie: that there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 elections. This is simply not true. Unfortunately, that excuse is being used in states across the nation that are attempting to pass similar legislation to restrict voting rights.” Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey told CNBC: “Let me be crystal clear and unequivocal. This legislation is unacceptable. It is a step backward and it does not promote principles we have stood for in Georgia around broad access to voting, around voter convenience, about ensuring election integrity.” Quincey added the new law “needs to be remedied.” Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp pushed back against the criticism of the new law that tightens restrictions on early and absentee voting rules from the 2020 election, makes it easier to challenge the validity of individual votes, and gives the state Legislature more power over the process. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that “Kemp and other GOP leaders say they were caught off guard by the opposition” and that the Republican-controlled House “retaliated by narrowly voting to end a lucrative tax break on jet fuel during the final, frenzied day of the legislative session.” “They like our public policy when we’re doing things that benefit them,” Republican House Speaker David Ralston said of the vote. “You don’t feed a dog that bites your hand. You got to keep that in mind sometimes.” I’m not sure that vote and quote came out quite like Ralston and Republicans thought it would. That sounds an awful lot like extortion. It’s unclear what next steps will or should be taken, but momentum does appear to be gathering to exert pressure on the state of Georgia—and others—to think again before trying to pass measures to restrict the vote. Corporate pressure has been successful in the recent past, particularly on noxious anti-LGBTQ bills passed in state legislatures, and pressure is already getting ramped up on Georgia-based companies, including the sports teams. President Joe Biden, in an interview Wednesday on ESPN, expressed support for moving this year’s MLB All-Star Game out of the state of Georgia over the new law.
slate| Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed a sweeping voter suppression bill into law on Thursday in a closed-door ceremony attended by fellow white Republicans. When Rep. Park Cannon, a Black Democrat, tried to attend the ceremony, she was arrested and charged with two felonies. The new law, S.B. 202, is a direct response to Democrats’ recent victories in Georgia, and targets the Black communities that helped Democratic candidates secure those wins. Republicans were able to pass the law only because, in 2013’s Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme Court freed the state from direct oversight under the Voting Rights Act. In Shelby County, Chief Justice John Roberts notoriously declared that racism is now so vanishingly rare that Congress cannot justify the VRA’s most stringent infringement on “the equal sovereignty of the states.” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s celebrated dissent did not merely refute Roberts’ decision; it accurately predicted the wave of voter suppression laws that followed in its wake. S.B. 202 may be the most perverse vindication of Ginsburg’s prophecy yet. It is precisely the kind of Jim Crow–style attack on democracy that the justice anticipated nearly eight years ago. Shelby County dismantled the centerpiece of the VRA, its preclearance requirement. Under this provision, states with a history of racist voter suppression could not alter their election laws without approval from the Department of Justice or a federal court in D.C. Preclearance, which Congress overwhelmingly reauthorized in 2006, had blocked countless efforts to diminish racial minorities’ electoral impact. Yet, in Shelby County, Roberts decided that Congress had failed to prove its continued necessity. To support this conclusion, he cited statistics showing that Black voter participation had surged in the South, proving that “things have changed dramatically.” Roberts’ opinion rests on an indefensible, made-up rationale that favors an abstract and artificial conception of states’ rights over Congress’ constitutional authority to outlaw race-based voting discrimination—the same approach, ironically, that required the VRA’s passage in the first place. It also just doesn’t make any sense; as Ginsburg famously explained Roberts’ illogic in her dissent: “Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.” After Shelby County, as state after state passed draconian restrictions on the right to vote and shuttered thousands of polling places—all of which disproportionately disenfranchised voters of color—Ginsburg’s umbrella quip has become perhaps the most accurate prognostication in modern Supreme Court history. Even more impressively, Ginsburg anticipated exactly the kind of laws that Republicans around the country are currently passing. The VRA successfully abolished what she called “first-generation” barriers to ballot access, like literacy and jelly bean tests. In recent decades, however, “second-generation barriers to minority voting rights have emerged” as substitutes. Ginsburg continued: In essence, Ginsburg viewed voter suppression as a virus that will continually mutate to overcome each effort to suppress it. When left untreated, it will replicate endlessly until it kills its host. In its early form, the virus of voter suppression was obvious. Congress held it in check, more or less, with preclearance. After the Supreme Court removed that strong medicine, it mutated into a “more subtle” yet still dangerous second generation. Yet the voter suppression measures that Georgia implemented in light of Shelby County, including poll closures in Black communities, were not enough to kill democracy in the state; Democrats, after all, were still able to win elections. With S.B. 202, the virus has mutated into an even more lethal form. Consider how several different components of the law interact. S.B. 202 strictly limits the number of ballot drop boxes counties can offer, and requires them to be located within early voting sites. The boxes may only be accessible when those sites are open. The bill also prohibits the use of drop boxes starting four days before an election—which is when voters need them most, since a ballot that is mailed at that point may not arrive on time. It shortens the voting period for runoff races and sharply curtails early voting for runoffs. And it compels some counties, including those with large Black communities, to reduce their early voting hours. These provisions all guarantee longer lines at the polls, even though Georgians—especially those of color—already wait for hours to cast their ballots. And here is the twist that elevates S.B. 202 above today’s garden-variety voter suppression laws: The law makes it a crime for volunteers to pass out food or water to voters waiting in those endless lines. Georgia Republicans have forced voters to stand outside for hours and, to make the experience as unpleasant as possible, forbidden anyone from providing them with basic sustenance to help them stay in line for as long as it takes. The inevitable consequence of this assault on the right to vote: A significant number of would-voters in predominantly Black, Democratic areas will simply give up. Voting rights advocates have already filed suit against S.B. 202, but there is virtually no chance that this ultraconservative Supreme Court will block any provision of the law. Were it not for Shelby County, Merrick Garland’s Justice Department would have stopped this bill in its tracks. Instead, the infection Ginsburg warned us about may kill Georgia’s democracy for good.

There are now 253 bills in 43 states that aim to restrict voting access, according to a recent report by the Brennan Center for Justice. That’s a lot of bills, in just the past two months. Even Ari Berman, a reporter at Mother Jones who’s been covering voting rights for a decade, says, “I’ve never seen anything like this before.” Republicans are behind this new wave of voting restrictions, and they control most statehouses across the country. On Thursday’s episode of What Next, I spoke to Berman about how they’re justifying voter suppression and how Democrats can fight back at the state and federal levels. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. Ari Berman: Georgia is fascinating because Republicans wrote every aspect of the state’s voting laws, so they were totally fine with it until it didn’t work for them anymore. And the second it didn’t work for them, now they’re trying to change the entire thing. They can’t say this voting law or that voting law is a Democratic plot because they did all of it. Every press release from the Georgia secretary of state brags that Georgia is a national leader in elections because it has the trifecta of automatic voter registration, early voting, and no-excuse absentee voting. And Republicans have now introduced and passed bills through committee to repeal or restrict all three of those things. They have passed bills through committee to repeal automatic voter registration, which 5 million of 7.6 million registered voters in Georgia use to register. They have passed bills through committee to repeal no-excuse absentee voting, which 1.3 million Georgians used in November. They have tried to cut days of weekend voting, including Sunday voting, when Black churches used “souls to the polls” voter mobilization drives. So they really are trying to repeal or severely restrict everything in the state of Georgia that makes it easy to vote. These are not small changes around the margins. These are sweeping changes that would dramatically reshape and restrict voting access in the state. Mary Harris: It’s notable that not all Georgia Republicans agree these restrictions are necessary, or even a good idea politically. There’s different dividing lines. The speaker of the House said he doesn’t want to get rid of no-excuse absentee voting. That is not in any of the House bills so far that have been passed to restrict voting rights. The lieutenant governor, who presides over the Senate, is not for that either. Gov. Brian Kemp has been vague about what he wants to do, but I think he is very aware of the fact that most likely Stacey Abrams is going to run against him in 2022. And a lot of Democrats, and in particular a lot of Black voters, are still angry about the voter suppression that happened in 2018 when Brian Kemp was both secretary of state and a candidate for governor and appeared to use the state’s voting laws as a weapon against Stacey Abrams and a weapon against Black voters. And so I think he realizes if he signs bills making it harder to vote, that Abrams and other people in Georgia are going to use that against him for the next two years. They’re going to rally voters against him and they’re going to say the governor, the Republican leadership of the state, they don’t want Black voters to participate, they don’t want voters of color to participate. And that may mobilize people to turn out again and to be motivated to not have their votes taken away from them. So it’s unclear how this is going to work politically, but it’s also clear that the legislature, in some form or another, is going to pass laws making it more difficult to vote based on zero evidence that it actually needs to happen. What do the efforts look like to stop these Republican laws from passing? When it comes to the Democrats, how can they insert themselves here, given that they’re not part of the majority? First off, just publicity. I mean, there was a truck that was circling the Georgia legislature on Friday that had a banner that said “Georgia Republicans don’t want Black people to vote.” And this is a state where voters of color are 40 percent of the electorate. Georgia was the only state in which Black people made up a majority of Joe Biden’s voters. So Black voters and voters of color are a very influential segment of the electorate in Georgia. A lot of times voter suppression succeeds because people don’t know it’s going on. They’re able to pass it under the rug and just think that there won’t be any outrage because people won’t really be following it. That’s not going to happen in Georgia. That’s not going to happen in other states. This is getting a lot of attention at the state level. This is starting to get more attention nationally. And Democrats are able to both make a stink about it, but also they’re able to exploit these Republican divides and say, “It was your Republican secretary of state that said over and over and over this election was secure, there was no fraud, Donald Trump and other people who were allied with him were lying.” That makes for a pretty effective argument. Looking nationally, there are also 704 bills with provisions to improve access to voting. It seems like that would be good news. It would be good news if all of those bills to improve voting rights actually had the same chance of passing as all the bills to restrict voting rights do. Because if you look at who controls the states right now, Republicans control many more states than Democrats do. So bills to make voting easier, by and large, are only going to pass in Democratic-controlled states. But if you look at all the places that Republicans control—Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Texas—they are very, very quickly moving to restrict voting rights. It is the No. 1 thing or very close to the No. 1 thing they’re trying to do in all of these states that are competitive—or even not really that competitive. The amazing thing to me is that you have Idaho and Wyoming and Montana, all of these states that Donald Trump carried easily, they’re also making it harder to vote. So it just seems like this voter suppression virus has infected the entire Republican Party. They are doing this all across the country, and it’s really remarkable to see how orchestrated it is. It’s almost like their ability to do voter suppression has become a litmus test for how loyal of Republicans they are—like pushing voter suppression is now the same thing as being pro-life or pro-gun. If you don’t do it, you’re not a loyal Republican, you’re a RINO. And that’s so disturbing. The idea that restricting access to the ballot is now something that you have to do to prove your loyalty to the Republican Party and prove your loyalty to Trump is just an incredibly alarming and I think new development in American politics. They’re just so insecure in terms of the power they have that even if they won the election, they clearly don’t believe that they’re going to win it forever, or else they wouldn’t be changing the voting systems in Iowa or Florida and other states. Let’s talk about what might happen if these bills are passed. In the past, the courts have stepped in to intervene, especially with something like restricting Sunday voting—North Carolina tried to pass a similar law in 2013. Courts got in there and said no. Can we expect that to happen now? I don’t have a whole lot of faith in the courts, when Donald Trump appointed 234 judges, including three new members of the Supreme Court. I think that the courts are going to be very lenient towards these Republican efforts. There may be a few really extreme provisions that they strike down. But on the whole, I think the courts are going to say that we think states should be able to run their elections how they see fit. So if the courts aren’t going to fix this, what will? I think federal legislation. Democrats control Washington. They’re in a position to pass a new Voting Rights Act. They’re in a position to pass the For the People Act, the most important democracy reform bill in a generation. They have the power to do these things. If there’s any way to try to stop this, it’s to create federal rules to make it easier to vote. What’s in the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act? The For the People Act has all of these provisions that would make it easier to vote, because Congress can regulate the rules for federal elections. So it would mandate that every state for federal elections would have automatic registration, would have Election Day registration, would have early voting, would have nonpartisan redistricting, would give voting rights back to people with past felony convictions. So, many of the things that we’re talking about Republicans trying to do, they wouldn’t be able to do for federal elections because the For the People Act would have these broad protections for voting rights enshrined for races for the House or the Senate or for the president. And that would go a long way to blocking the kind of voter suppression efforts we’re talking about in the states. How does the John Lewis Voting Rights Act push even beyond that? The John Lewis Voting Rights Act responds to the Shelby County v. Holder decision, where the Supreme Court in 2013 said that states with a long history of discrimination no longer have to approve their voting changes with the federal government. In that decision, the Supreme Court basically said to Congress: You can write a new version of the Voting Rights Act. One of our biggest issues with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is it’s based on old data. So the John Lewis Voting Rights Act would require states with a more recent history of voting discrimination to have to approve their voting changes with the federal government once again. That would include states like Georgia that both discriminated against voters of color in the past but have also discriminated against them more recently, as found by the courts. And so if Georgia wanted to get rid of automatic registration or get rid of early voting or do something like that, they would have to get that approved with the federal government, either with the courts or the Justice Department. It would also require voting changes in every state that have a disproportionate impact on minority voters to have to be approved federally as well. So if you’re in Utah and you want to close a polling place in an area with a high percentage of voters of color, you would have to get that approved as well. So it’s both sweeping and targeted at the same time. And I think these bills work really well hand in hand, because the For the People Act would basically do all these good things, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act would basically stop all of these bad things. I think you need that combination of carrots and sticks to really protect voting rights in this day and age. My understanding is these two bills are alive in the House, but not so alive in the Senate. They’re alive in the Senate if you can pass them with 50 votes. They are alive if you get rid of the filibuster to pass them. Right now, Joe Manchin, Kyrsten Sinema, they’re saying we’re not going to get rid of the filibuster. So they’re dead as of now. What Democrats are betting is that if Republicans block enough legislation and if Republicans do enough extreme things at the state level, these senators might change their tune. In Arizona, Kyrsten Sinema’s home state, they have introduced more restrictions on voting than any other state, even more than in Georgia. They’re trying to roll back mail voting in all sorts of ways. They’re trying to cut in-person voting. They’re trying to get rid of automatic registration. There’s even a bill in Arizona that would allow the Legislature there to appoint its own electors no matter what the voters do, so basically that would render the presidential election completely void if the Legislature can just step in at any moment to overturn it. So I think at some level, Kyrsten Sinema and other Democrats in Arizona have to view these as an attack on democracy, but also as an attack on them, an attack on their ability to get reelected. They also know that the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the For the People Act would stop a lot of these efforts. And so these federal bills, yes, they’re not going to pass the Senate now. Democrats are betting that in six months, the political situation, the political calculus of these senators, might be different. Get more news from Mary Harris every weekday.
slate| After historic Black turnout flipped Georgia and sent two Democrats to the Senate, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed a new law that could hit Black and other voters of color hard. Now the army of activists who turned Georgia blue are battling to keep it that way. On Friday’s episode of A Word, I spoke to LaTosha Brown about the situation. She is the co-founder of Black Voters Matter, one of the groups that helped Democrats win Georgia at the Senate and presidential level. We discussed how activists are fighting back against this new controversial law. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Jason Johnson: So I just want to start with this: Did you all think that this was going to happen no matter what? Did you think that Brian Kemp was always going to sign laws like this? Had it always been in the hopper, or do you think it was a direct response to Democrats doing so well in the state last November? LaTosha Brown: If you know the history of the South, and voting behavior in the South, anytime there has been a Black advancement or Black people have showed up, we’ve seen a white backlash in some form or fashion—something punitive that normally comes up to try to prevent or marginalize our voice and our votes. And so, on one hand, there was something to be expected. We had this historic turnout in this last election cycle. I don’t think we knew that they would go that far. Now, mind you, this is a state that both the entire legislative branch and the governor’s office, those are all Republicans. Fulton County is a county [where] you have a sizable Black population. Atlanta is a majority Black city. DeKalb County is a majority Black county. And so those were the counties, quite frankly, that made the difference in this election cycle, which was propelled primarily by Black voters, with other voters as well, particularly communities of color. But what is so egregious in this bill is that it would give the GOP the ability to take over power from the secretary of state. And so now within this bill, it will take over the secretary of state’s office and will actually take over power of the board of elections in the different counties. So DeKalb County and Fulton County, which they could not control, because you do have Black leadership in those places, they’ve basically essentially given themselves power that they can actually just nullify and say, “We don’t agree with the results.” Tell us some of the things that you and Black Voters Matter have faced in Georgia. What kind of intimidation, and sometimes government sponsored or vigilante levels of violence, have you faced just trying to organize people to vote? This history of Jim Crow, and this history of how there has always been this parallel of not just voter suppression, but violence, right? That has been inflicted in our communities and directed at Black women. What we’ve seen in South Georgia is that we would pull up… I mean, it was like In the Heat of the Night. We would pull up in these rural communities and at a gas station, and in front of us, the gas station owner would literally take the sign and say closed. He might as well say, “Negroes are not welcome.” And literally just look at us and close the sign. One trip, we were going from Alabama to Georgia, coming back to Georgia, and the bus windows got burst out. And the white state trooper refused to even go look at the window to file a report. Black officers came, who were with the city police and the local county sheriff’s office. And it was because of them that literally we were actually attended to. Even in Georgia, I’ve gotten unknown, unmarked packages from Russia sent to my house. The bottom line is that it is in that kind of contentious environment that we’ve had to actually hire layers of security as we move around the state. But nevertheless: Can’t stop, won’t stop, we continue to go. A lot of the discussion about Georgia has been putting pressure on businesses. What is the role of putting pressure on Delta or Coca-Cola or Home Depot, or any of these businesses? One, how do you guys do that? Two, is it really effective? Could Home Depot, Delta, or Coca-Cola make a difference in these kinds of laws? So, that’s an excellent question. I think we also have to recognize as organizers, there’s always a relationship between the politics and the economics. And so what we have launched in Georgia is a corporate accountability campaign. We took out a couple of ads, full-page ads, in local newspapers, all across the state, including the ones with the largest circulations, just calling the question. Like, “Are you standing with the voters of Georgia?” A few years ago, there was an abortion ban bill in Georgia. And there were corporations and businesses—primarily the film industry took a lot of the lead that time—that said, “We’re not coming to Georgia. We’re not doing business in Georgia if this is the kind of things that y’all are passing.” We saw the same thing in North Carolina with the bathroom bill. My point is those corporations have an enormous amount of influence and political capital. Tell us a little bit about this slate of Black Fortune 500 CEOs that are out there now doing advocacy work and telling these large businesses that they need to pay attention as well. Number one, I’m going to just lift up that that is what real accountable corporate leadership looks like. To come out and use your power, your space of privilege to say, “This is wrong, and our company is going to call and speak to that being wrong.” We saw that with Salesforce. Every chance I get, I like to shout out to Salesforce, because they’re not even based in Georgia, and they literally came out with the strongest and the most clear statement around these voter suppression bills in Georgia. These Black CEOs that have come out and said that this voter suppression is unacceptable, and they’re going to use the weight of their companies to really push the defeat of these bills all across the nation, that is something that is critical, that is something that is needed, should be lifted up. And I do think that it’s going to change the trajectory. There’s a real conflict here. Obviously you’ve shown that you can put pressure on a lot of huge Fortune 500 companies to try to change what’s happening with voter suppression in Georgia, but you have other people who say, “We should just boycott these companies.” Where do you fall on this? Do you think that that corporate pressure on a brand is more effective, or do you think boycotting is the best way to put pressure on state governments to roll back some of these voter suppression laws they’re trying to pass? I don’t know if I think that there’s either/or; I think it’s and. There’s this idea that Black people should only have access to one form of pressure. I think when people are fighting you, and your community is under attack, you should use every single tool that’s available to you. And so the AME Church has actually called for a boycott. And while my organization, in particular, has not called for a boycott, we’re also not telling people not to boycott. We believe that people should make choices of who they spend their money with, their hard-earned money with those companies that align with their values. But we’re also saying that there are other strategies as well. And I think that you have to have all of those tools that are working in concert together to put the pressure and light on folks to make these companies actually step up and stand out.

slate| On Friday, Major League Baseball announced that it’s moving the 2021 All-Star Game and the 2021 MLB Draft out of Georgia, in response to the state’s new voting law, SB 202. In a statement, Commissioner Rob Manfred said, “Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box. Fair access to voting continues to have our game’s unwavering support.” The Atlanta Braves, who would have hosted the All-Star Game, responded with a snippy statement of their own, saying that while the “organization will continue to stress the importance of equal voting opportunities […] Unfortunately, businesses, employees, and fans in Georgia are the victims of this decision.” Donald Trump predictably said his followers should boycott baseball, but it wasn’t just the Braves and the Trumpists and Fox News who cast doubt on MLB’s decision. Voting rights activist Stacey Abrams said she was happy that the league and its players spoke out, but that she didn’t support moving the game, a move she said would hurt the state economically. On Tuesday, the league announced the game will be held in Denver instead. On this week’s Hang Up and Listen, Slate’s sports podcast, the hosts discussed the Georgia law, MLB’s decision, and the national reactions to both. A portion of their conversation is transcribed below. It has been edited and condensed for length and clarity. Josh Levin: In 2016, when the NBA announced it was pulling its All-Star Game from Charlotte because of North Carolina’s bigoted trans-bathroom bill, we could say, “Oh, that’s basketball. That has a younger, more liberal fan base. It’s got a progressive commissioner, Adam Silver, yada yada …” But baseball has neither a young nor a liberal fan base. Rob Manfred, not known for being progressive. And yeah, we can talk about corporate and sponsor pressure having a lot to do with this decision, but it is worth noting that golf’s PGA Tour announced last week that it’s not moving its season-ending tour championship out of Georgia. So what do you think baseball is doing here? Joel Anderson: I think, like any other large corporation, Major League Baseball was reluctantly dragged into a political fight that it wanted no part of, but simply could not avoid. And a lot of that is because they’re a victim of bad timing. Their All-Star Game just happens to fall this year, at this time, in the midst of this large political fight. So they couldn’t really run from it. And I think the tell of that is this: Anyone who has remotely followed politics in the last year, or even the last 50, knew that Georgia Republicans and Republicans in statehouses all around the country, were going to rush through a series of so-called voter reform laws, right? They telegraphed this the whole damn time, including when people were running up into the Capitol, complaining about a stolen election. This was all telegraphed. We knew this was coming and nobody said anything. Right? There wasn’t any of this talk about a boycott or anything before that. They’re acting like this is something new. So when Georgia legislators were meeting and drafting this bill, there was plenty of time for everyone to speak up and say, “Hey, this is wrong. We don’t support it. And if it passes, we’re prepared to take action.” The MLB, Coca-Cola, Delta, Chick-fil-A—but not Chick-fil-A, because I’m sure they side with the bill as it is—but they all could have said this in February. They could have applied pressure before the law passed, let everyone know what the political economic stakes were there. But they didn’t. And now everyone is scrambling here at the 13th hour. So, you know, I guess the league has been clearly headed in this direction. Last summer, they delivered a statement about Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. They talked about how the game has zero tolerance for racism and racial injustice. They’re featuring Black and brown players as the faces of the game. They know what the predictions about the country’s demographics are. They can’t afford to be dragged into the future, but to be honest, it doesn’t matter what Major League Baseball believes. The important thing is that they’re putting their money where their mouths are. I don’t want to belittle or diminish this decision, because I think it actually is meaningful, but I just do wish that they had been ahead of this. There was an opportunity to get ahead of it, and now they’re behind it. And now they’re dealing with the political fallout. Stefan Fatsis: So I think that Major League Baseball acted the way a big, entrenched, politically divided sport in America, that isn’t the NBA, is going to act. They were reading tea leaves in February, right? They were probably hoping that this bill would not pass, that this wouldn’t happen and they wouldn’t be put in a difficult position. But once they were put in this difficult position, they kind of did the right thing here. And I think that does deserve some credit. I think this is better than baseball saying, “We don’t want to get involved in politics,” or, “We support everyone’s right to vote, but we feel like we’ve made a commitment to Atlanta and the Braves to stage the All-Star Game there this year.” I think baseball looked at this and said, “Fuck it. These people aren’t worth it. Why get on the wrong side of everybody else here?” This was a position that is supportable. It is palatable. It does not make baseball look like reactionaries. And the downside is pretty small. Levin: Well, the downside, I think, is one that, for instance, the NFL and NFL team owners didn’t want. Back when Donald Trump was president and they were deciding what to do about the racial justice protests, that downside [was] becoming a kind of pariah in conservative media and in conservative circles. I mean, it’s not just Donald Trump. It’s Tucker Carlson, it’s Fox News, it’s Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. And for an organization like Major League Baseball, which does have as a major part of its ownership and constituency people that align with conservatism and who do skew older. This isn’t something that Major League Baseball has any interest in being involved in. And there is a different way forward here, that the PGA Tour, I think, is trying to tow a very different line [on] and putting out a statement that’s like, “We believe in voting rights, but also we’re not going to move our championship.” And they could have chosen that different path and aligned themselves with Stacey Abrams and said, “We don’t believe that this is right. We think it’s wrong. We stand strongly against it. But we also don’t believe in punishing the good people of Georgia. And we’re not going to run from this fight. We’re going to come be there and be involved in this and speak out against it from this place where we have a team and where we have this huge potential event in July, where we can make that a centerpiece.” And so they chose. It’s not like they had no options here, Joel. Anderson: Yeah. Well, and I’m sort of curious, maybe you guys can help answer this for me: Are people sort of overstating the economic argument here? Because do people really come into town from all over the country, in the middle of a pandemic, for an All-Star Game? We know that when municipalities and towns and cities host these events, it ends up costing those areas more money than they end up getting in terms of economic benefit. We’re just taking them at face value that this is going to hurt them economically too, I think. Maybe it’s a great showcase for the city on TV, but like who in the hell isn’t aware of Atlanta? You know what I mean? Like nobody is going to watch the All-Star Game and be like, “Wow, I wasn’t thinking about Atlanta before, but now I see it on TV. This must be great.” So I think to me, at least, people are overstating the economic implications, but maybe I’m wrong about that. Fatsis: No, no, no. You’re absolutely right. I mean, the economic implications of one game over a weekend with some ancillary Fan Zone and hotel sales are totally overblown. This is zero-sum stuff, right? If there were no All-Star Game, the way there is going to be no All-Star Game in every other major league city this summer, there is no lost economic benefit here to the city, frankly. Levin: It would bring attention, and maybe that’s part of Major League Baseball’s calculus. Fatsis: Sure. Levin: OK. It might sound good in the moment to be like, “We’re not going to cancel this because we’re going to stay and fight for what we believe in,” but do they really want their showcase game and event of the summer—where all the stars that they’re highlighting in these commercials are going to be—do they want that whole thing to turn into some sort of public service announcement about voting rights, where like Fernando Tatís Jr. and Ronald Acuña and Mike Trout, instead of being asked about their feats on the field are asked, “What do you think about what Republicans are doing to voting in America?” Fatsis: Or even more than that, Josh, what if the players, led by this coalition of African American players, the Players Alliance, decided to take a stand? I mean, the reporting so far was that no, the players weren’t going to boycott the All-Star Game because of this, but it sure as hell would have given them a terrific platform to make a statement about this. And that would have made both Atlanta and Georgia and Major League Baseball, their employers, look pretty bad. Anderson: Yeah. Also, imagine trying to do this though: Hold an All-Star Game that’s going to be tied so explicitly to the memory of Hank Aaron, right? A guy who did not want to go to Atlanta in the first place, because it wasn’t an integrated city at that point. So imagine them having to play that game against the backdrop of all of that. It just seems like … Again, I’m not saying that MLB and Rob Manfred aren’t for voting rights or that they’re not politically engaged in some of this stuff, but the timing of it is I think more salient here than their political ideology. Levin: And this hasn’t been brought up that much, but there’s also the symbolism of playing the game in a stadium in suburban Cobb County. Anderson: Yeah. Levin: It’s not actually in the city of Atlanta. And when the Braves moved there, there was all this talk about, “Oh, Turner Field. The old stadium is in like a crime-ridden neighborhood,” and all of this not particularly coded racial talk, and it’s moved to this place that’s not accessible by rail, because people in Cobb County—predominantly white, suburban county—voted not to extend the rail system to their community. And so symbolism there is not particularly pretty. Fatsis: No. And I would take it a step further, Josh, that this game would have been hosted by a team, at a time when the Washington football team is changing its name, the Cleveland baseball team has agreed to change its name, and here’s another team with a Native American name and racist imagery in its logos and other stuff over time, where fans very likely would have been performing a racist chant, when one of the Atlanta Braves players came to the plate during the game. And as you said, [it’s a team that] left the majority Black city. This looks bad on—this could have looked bad on that score too. Anderson: Yeah. I mean, man, just to sort of double-down on that point. They moved to Cobb County, where there’s a Lester Maddox bridge. And for people that are not familiar with Atlanta or Georgia, Lester Maddox was an explicitly segregationist governor who got elected in the early 1970s. Right? This is even almost within the span of our lifetimes that Georgia has this guy. That bridge still exists today. That’s on the way to the stadium there right now. So it’s like, all the imagery is working against Georgia and the Atlanta area in particular right here. It’s like, you guys are in no position to hold any judgment against anybody else. Clearly you all have your own issues that you’re dealing with. And it’s OK if people from outside of Georgia or Atlanta step in and say, “You know what? Don’t think we want to be here. Don’t want to be involved in that. Don’t want any of that imagery involved with our showcase game.” Fatsis: Yeah. You mentioned Henry Aaron. I mean, as Howard Bryant pointed out on Twitter over the weekend, the only reason that Atlanta has a baseball team is because the city agreed to integrate seating at Fulton County Stadium as a condition for Aaron and the Milwaukee Braves to move South. Levin: I think it’s worth circling back to SB 202 itself. And there have been a bunch of useful pieces. Georgia Public Broadcasting had one, [and] the New York Times had one, just about the various kind of things that are in the bill and that aren’t in the bill. And it’s not as simple and explicit as being—Some of the early drafts are like, “No voting on Sundays,” and some things that seem kind of obvious to target this increased voting power of Black communities and people of color in Georgia that led to Democrats winning Senate seats and led to Joe Biden winning the state in 2020. But the stuff that’s actually in the bill, it’s a little bit more confusing what the effect is going to be. Or maybe some things might actually be good, but the increased voter ID requirements are going to likely disenfranchise Black voters disproportionately. And I think it’s important to look at that stuff and read that stuff. But the most important thing is to look at who’s behind this. Anderson: Mm-hmm. Levin: And back to what you were saying, Joel: This was a movement, and it’s going on across the entire country, that’s entirely based on the fact that Donald Trump lost. And if you look at the architects of this, both in the state and in the groups that are writing this model legislation, it’s all, like, these Stop the Steal people, and this guy Hans von Spakovsky who’s been pushing voter fraud lies for decades. And so it feels to me like, again, while it’s important to look at what the law actually says, this is fruit from a poisoned tree. Fatsis: Yeah. Levin: The thing that I think is complicated for Major League Baseball and other corporations is that this is basically an argument about whether we can just forget what happened with the election and with the Stop the Steal thing, and with the Capitol riot, and just kind of quote-unquote “go back to normal” and allow the people that did this to be reassimilated into polite society and politics, or whether these people and these ideas need to be just drummed out of everything. It is, I think, important to lay a marker down, like maybe Major League Baseball is doing. I don’t know if they’re intending to do this, but maybe practically they are, and say, “This is not what we are as America. This is not what we should be doing.” But I do feel like there is going to be this kind of cultural and political forgetting, and these people are going to be kind of reassimilated. And so this is a really important moment right now, where the kind of early lines are being drawn about what’s going to be OK and what isn’t. Fatsis: Yeah. I think that’s an important point to make, because the marker that’s being laid down is just saying no—saying no to this nonsense. Mitch McConnell on Monday morning said “corporations will invite serious consequences if they become a vehicle for far-left mobs to hijack our country from outside the constitutional order.” And Major League Baseball is saying this is nonsense, and it should be ignored. Levin: But this is like Republicans against Delta and Coke. I mean, can you imagine, like, Delta and Coke being considered part of the woke quote-unquote … Anderson: The resistance. Fatsis: The resistance, yeah. Levin: … the woke liberal mob? Anderson: Yeah. If you’re going to take the fight to anybody, you might as well do it against Brian Kemp, a guy who ascended politically in large part through his own efforts at attacking quote, “voter fraud,” and pushing through regressive voter suppression efforts. That guy is one of the—If there was a Mount Rushmore of people who were behind voter suppression efforts in this country, it would be Brian Kemp, a guy who is notorious for basically running his own gubernatorial election against Stacey Abrams. And then basically empowering Stacey Abrams a couple of years later when she’s led the Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff Senate victories a few years later. So if you’re going to take the fight to anybody, it might as well be Brian Kemp. And actually, I’m glad you brought that up, Josh. Because I had one quick thing to point out, and it’s sort of a little bit afield, but I’ve been pointing this out on Twitter for the last couple of years. And I think the last few days have pretty much validated everything I’ve ever thought about the sort of people who unironically deploy the words “woke” and “cancel culture” in these sort of debates. From Donald Trump to Brian Kemp and so on: They’ve co-opted what was once a really cool term, woke, meaning the moment that a Black person becomes aware of the impact that racism has in every facet of their life. That’s something that I grew up with, that was the term that we used for it, ironically or unironically, whatever. And now they’re using it to bolster anti-Black arguments and debate points. So to me personally, woke is the new N-word, or the new N-word lover. And there’s no way that you can look at the gradual bastardization of the word and tell me otherwise, though of course Stefan is our resident words expert here. But there’s actually a really good article in the Washington Post last week about the journey cancel culture and woke have taken in the last few years. And even Dr. Meredith Clark at [the University of Virginia] has been doing lots of good work and research on those terms the past few years. So all that to say, if you weren’t using woke prior to 2018, you’re suspect, and I for one can hear that dog whistle. Levin: Thank you for that, Joel. And I want to end with some uncertainty, because what happened with the NBA and the All-Star Game in North Carolina is that HB2, the trans bathroom bill, was repealed. They didn’t have the All-Star Game there in 2017, but they rescheduled it, and it was there in 2019. I don’t know what’s going to happen here. It seems unlikely that Brian Kemp and his allies in Georgia are going to be like, “You know what? Our bad.” And so what does Major League Baseball do? They’re trying to thread this needle here. You can look at it from one perspective and say, in a sea of bad corporate choices, they’re actually trying to avoid conflict as much as they can. But this is not going to go away.

slate| A Democratic state representative in Georgia was arrested and removed from the state Capitol Thursday evening after trying to attend a ceremony celebrating Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s signing of a new law making it harder to vote. Video of the scene shows Rep. Park Cannon, who is Black, calmly attempting to enter the signing ceremony and subsequent press conference being held in the governor’s Capitol office. Cannon can be seen approaching and lightly knocking on the closed doors before being intercepted by state troopers. In a brief, subdued encounter that was more a mild-mannered registering of protest than a provocation, Cannon was abruptly handcuffed and hauled out of the Capitol. It took the state troopers all of 50 seconds from the time Cannon first tapped on the door to handcuff and arrest her. Meanwhile, inside Kemp’s office: Cannon was taken from the Capitol, placed in a police car, and held at Fulton County Jail until she was released on bond Thursday evening. The lawmaker was charged with obstruction of law enforcement and disrupting General Assembly sessions, both of which are felonies. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that court documents stated Cannon was charged with “ ‘knowingly and intentionally’ knocking on the governor’s door during a bill signing and stomping on Officer L.T. Langford’s foot three times.” The arrest warrant said: “The accused continued kicking on LT Langford with her heels.” The arrest is an affront, as is the Georgia bill passed in response to the 2020 election that Georgia Republicans, for the first time in decades, lost. Despite finding no credible claims of voter fraud or systemic irregularities of any kind in multiple recounts and audits, Georgia Republicans leveraged GOP outrage stemming from Donald Trump’s election fraud fiction. The Georgia law is the first restrictive voting law to pass in a nationwide push by Republicans in the name of “election integrity.” Some of the most noxious parts of the original bill, like requiring an excuse for voters to vote by mail and cutting weekend early voting hours popular among Democrats, were ultimately stripped due to a Democratic outcry. In addition to a number of inoffensive administrative changes, however, the new law still adds new voter ID requirements for absentee ballots, restricts the use of absentee drop boxes, empowers electors to challenge the eligibility of an unlimited number of voters, and gives state election officials the power to take over local elections boards. The new law also criminalizes distributing food and water to voters waiting in line. Cannon called the law “Jim Crow in a suit and tie.”
slate| In the spring of 2012, Virginia’s General Assembly passed a bill that required women throughout the commonwealth to undergo a transvaginal ultrasound procedure before they were allowed to terminate a pregnancy. That law set off a massive national furor because, despite framing that suggested the procedure was medically indicated (it wasn’t), the law was mainly just another means of embarrassing and violating women as part of a programmatic series of unnecessary “informed consent” laws intended to dissuade pregnant women from abortion. Amy Poehler and Seth Meyers spoofed the state on Saturday Night Live. Jon Stewart was merciless. Very soon after, Virginia’s Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, who was at the time on the list of 2012 Republican vice presidential hopefuls, panicked and withdrew his support for the vaginal probe, and a weaker version of the bill became law instead. At the time, according to a study by the Guttmacher Institute, Virginia would have been the eighth state to require ultrasounds before abortions, but only the Virginia law became a locus of nationwide fury. A harsher law was already in place in Texas (to be fair, Garry Trudeau, the Pulitzer-winning creator of Doonesbury, had gone after the Texas Legislature in a cartoon so controversial it was pulled in some newspapers). Today, according to Guttmacher, 26 states regulate the provision of ultrasound by abortion providers, and 10 states mandate that an abortion provider perform an ultrasound on every woman seeking an abortion, with eight states requiring the provider to offer the woman the opportunity to view the image. This past January, an Indiana law first signed by Gov. Mike Pence in 2016 finally went into effect, requiring that any woman seeking an abortion have an ultrasound performed at least 18 hours before the procedure, for no medical reason beyond “more information” and “the sanctity of life.” Mike Pence has his own viral state law controversy. Another Indiana law he’d signed in March of 2015, a “religious freedom” bill that would have allowed Indiana businesses to challenge local laws prohibiting discrimination against gay customers, caused another massive national uproar. The NCAA, headquartered in Indianapolis, took the lead on protest because the law passed just before the men’s Final Four tournament. As a result of the pushback, Pence signed a softer version of the bill in April of that year. When North Carolina passed a law in 2016 barring transgender people from using the public restroom aligned with their gender identities, the state’s economy took a $400 million hit as a result of boycotts from PayPal, Paul McCartney, and others. The state repealed the restriction in 2017. When Georgia passed the country’s at-the-time most draconian abortion law in 2019, effectively banning all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, there was another nationwide outcry. Although Georgia was the fourth state to pass such a law (pro-life groups were emboldened by the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh), Disney’s chief executive, Bob Iger, warned that it would be “very difficult” for the company to continue filming in Georgia if the law went into effect. Within a day, NBCUniversal and WarnerMedia made similar threats, and various celebrities refused to film there. That Georgia heartbeat bill was permanently enjoined in 2020, although more restrictive abortion bans have followed in other states. All of this is to say that, sure, high-level public and corporate outrage sometimes manages to soften or even kill a repressive state law. And those outcomes are surely real victories. But similar or even more cruel laws almost always wind up being passed by different state legislatures around the country—and many of them, even when they are far worse, end up largely ignored. Because so many Republican bills are copycat cut-and-paste jobs that are pushed simultaneously around the country by groups that produce fill-in-the-blank model legislation, a splashy public defeat in a single state can obscure huge successes in a dozen others. And while massive public attention focused on a single injustice in a single state is an important means of public education, it can also lead people to believe that what’s happening in that state is an outlier when in fact it’s the rule. North Carolina may not have a bathroom ban anymore, but over the past several months, a rash of states have passed laws prohibiting transgender girls from participating in school sports. And several states, including Arkansas, may be on the verge of criminalizing gender-affirming health care for trans youth. Several abortion bans that have sailed through state legislatures—including a near-total ban just passed in Arkansas—didn’t generate the nationwide controversy triggered by that Georgia law of 2019. So beyond purely tactical questions about whether massive corporate boycotts and peripatetic Hollywood attention directing people away from states in protest end up harming the Republican legislatures more than the marginalized communities who actually have to live in those economies, there is utility in asking whether all this focus on Georgia’s new vote-suppressive law takes attention away from the fact that Republican state legislators have already sponsored a tsunami of Georgia-style voting restrictions, versions of which are advancing in nearly every state. As the Brennan Center’s tracker notes, “As of March 24, legislators have introduced 361 bills with restrictive provisions in 47 states. That’s 108 more than the 253 restrictive bills tallied as of February 19, 2021—a 43 percent increase in little more than a month.” In other words, it’s not just Georgia. Brennan has clocked 55 restrictive bills in 24 states that are already moving through state legislatures. Like Georgia’s law, most target absentee voting. A quarter seek stricter voter ID. The measures out there would make voter registration harder, expand voter roll purges, and cut back on early voting. And hyperfocusing on Georgia’s restrictive law may distract us from other chilling efforts to sweep equally awful GOP disenfranchisement strategies across new areas—including Georgia’s own new regulations enabling the partisan state takeover of county elections officials, which are currently being cut and pasted right onto Texas. Making mass disenfranchisement a Georgia-specific problem unleashes debate over a host of Georgia-specific solutions, which in turn fosters a sprawling public conversation about corporate boycotts and Major League Baseball and whether voter ID laws are inherently racist. And while it’s always a good day when Mitch McConnell is whining about big business and unimpeded free speech, the kerfuffle over who is throwing out the first pitch leads us away from a broader reckoning with a systemic, nationwide GOP effort to tamp down voting that is playing out across the entire country in ways that go beyond mere voter ID laws. Nathaniel Persily, a professor of law at Stanford Law School, where he co-directs the Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project, explains in an email why Georgia is commanding attention for what is actually a nationwide problem: We are, in other words, laser-focused on Georgia this week because it provides the right metaphor. The racism of this new bill, paired with the state’s decades of history with Jim Crow vote suppression, certainly warrants particular attention, as does Georgia’s extremely recent history of activists flipping the state to win the Senate. But Georgia needs to continue to be the metaphor for the battle, and not the sole location of the battle. This voting rights battle is playing out everywhere the Big Lie is being parroted. And wasting time on petty arguments about Coca-Cola’s political speech rights or the lofty constitutional right of entry to a Major League ballpark is just part and parcel of the GOP forest/trees playbook. National political efforts to suppress the vote are happening everywhere, and it goes beyond just voter ID and Sunday voting. Georgia is Texas. Texas is New Hampshire. And New Hampshire is Florida. They are all different flavors of the same problem. That problem, believe it or not, is bigger even than Major League Baseball and Coca-Cola. And right now it’s more American than both too.
slate| A group of prominent Black business leaders is calling on corporate America to do more to fight a raft of Republican-inspired restrictive voter laws being pushed in state legislatures across the country. The effort, led by former American Express chief executive Kenneth Chenault and Kenneth Frazier, the head of the pharmaceutical company Merck, is a direct response to the recent passage of a restrictive voter law in Georgia and many more on the horizon just like it that will make it harder for Black and minority communities to vote. The group published a full-page ad Wednesday in the New York Times to raise awareness and spur action. The push by Chenault and Frazier comes as corporate America has been relatively silent on the issue of voting rights, other than to issue milquetoast affirmations of voting and democracy in general. Meanwhile, Georgia’s Republican-heavy state legislature plowed full speed ahead with a set of new voting laws enacted after the GOP lost the 2020 presidential election as well as both Senate seats. The law tightens ID requirements for absentee voting, curtails early voting options, and, perhaps more worryingly, gives the state legislature more authority over the local administration of elections, something that would have made it easier for Donald Trump to overturn the election last time, and possibly in the future. The Black business executives are attempting to increase pressure on corporate America to do something. Corporate pressure has been applied on a host of issues, notably bathroom bills and anti-LGBTQ laws, creating a new set of consequences for local Republican lawmakers looking to discriminate. “You had 60 major companies—Amazon, Google, American Airlines—that signed on to the statement that states a very clear opposition to harmful legislation aimed at restricting the access of L.G.B.T.Q. people in society,” Chenault told the Times. “So, you know, it is bizarre that we don’t have companies standing up to this.” “As African-American business executives, we don’t have the luxury of being bystanders to injustice,” Frazier said. “We don’t have the luxury of sitting on the sidelines when these kinds of injustices are happening all around us.”
slate| Major League Baseball will move the 2021 All-Star Game to Coors Field in Denver, Colorado, after the league announced on Friday that it was pulling the event from the Atlanta area in response to Georgia’s passage of new restrictive voting laws. The league is expected to make a formal announcement Tuesday on the new home for the July 13 game, as well as the MLB amateur draft, which was also scheduled to be hosted at the Atlanta Braves’ stadium, Truist Park. The league was remarkably decisive in its move to relocate the high-profile event out of Georgia, after a number of companies joined the chorus against the new voting law. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement that relocating the game “was the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport,” and that the decision was made after consulting with a host of people involved in the league, from team owners and executives to current and former players. Last week, on April 1, President Joe Biden said he would “strongly support” moving the All-Star Game in response to the new Georgia law.  
daily_wire| A group of black faith leaders in Georgia are targeting Home Depot — which has its headquarters in the state — and calling for a boycott of the company because it refuses to publicly criticize Georgia’s new voting law. The Home Depot was founded in 1978. In 1979, co-founders Bernard Marcus and Arthur Blank, who are both Jewish, opened the first two stores in Atlanta, Georgia, where the company’s headquarters are still located. The Home Depot Foundation has donated over $200 million to various causes, including Habitat for Humanity and the City of Hope National Medical Center, and offers the U.S. military community a 10% discount. Since 1993, the “Team Depot” program has given grants to veteran-based organizations and has worked with the Georgia Emergency Management Agency’s Ready Georgia campaign to aid emergency preparedness among Georgia’s children. Bishop Reginald T. Jackson, who supervises 534 African Methodist Episcopal churches in Georgia, stated, “We don’t believe this is simply a political matter. This is a matter that deals with securing the future of this democracy, and the greatest right in this democracy is the right to vote.” He claimed Home Depot “demonstrated an indifference, a lack of response to the call, not only from clergy, but a call from other groups to speak out in opposition to this legislation.” According to The New York Times, Jackson insisted The Home Depot take certain actions, including “speaking out against the Georgia voting law, publicly opposing similar bills in other states, offering support for the John Lewis Voting Rights Act in Congress, and backing litigation against the Georgia law.” The Rev. Timothy McDonald III echoed, “This is not just a Georgia issue; we’re talking about democracy in America that is under threat. We’ve got to use whatever leverage and power, spiritual fortitude that we have, including our dollars, to help people to understand that this is a national campaign.” The threat to boycott has prompted blowback online, including from prominent attorney Harmeet Dhillon, Fox News host Laura Ingraham and Daily Wire Editor Emeritus Ben Shapiro:      In July 2019, some critics of Home Depot vowed to launch a boycott of the company after it was revealed that Bernie Marcus, who had directed virtually all of his $6 billion to charity after his death, said some of his money would fund former President Trump’s re-election campaign. “He’s got a businessman’s common sense approach to most things,” Marcus said of Trump. “Now, do I agree with every move that he makes? No, I don’t. But the truth is he has produced more than anybody else. He has. If we look at this country, I would say that we are better off today than we were eight years ago or six years ago.” Marcus warned about socialism in April 2019, saying, “I want to start by saying something politically incorrect. I love America, I do. I love America because it’s the greatest country in the world. I think there are two big reasons why this country is so great. The first is our Constitution which guarantees our freedom of speech and expression. The second is our free market system. The free market system has been the biggest creator of wealth and prosperity the world has ever known, lifting billions of people out of poverty and far more superior than any government program could ever be. The free market is the tool that allows money to reach out and grab hold of the American dream.” Marcus added, “It pains me to see people in this country glorifying socialism. Young people especially have been indoctrinated into believing that free enterprise is immoral because it enriches the greedy and depresses the poor.” “Even the word capitalism is not politically correct to use, but the reality is that the free market system has created the biggest middle-class population in the world and while some may say socialism is well-intentioned, the fact is it robs people of their independence, their dignity, and their finances leading to government dependence, suppression of ideas, and lower standards of living for those under its thumb,” he added.

daily_wire| Congressman Burgess Owens (R-UT) on Tuesday slammed Democrats’ claims that Georgia’s new voter integrity laws are somehow comparable to Jim Crow laws. The freshman congressman shared his personal experience under Jim Crow, saying that it’s “extremely offensive” to make the assumption black Americans aren’t capable of getting a form of identification. “As someone who’s actually experienced Jim Crow laws, I’d like to set the record straight on the myth regarding the recently passed Georgia State law, and why any comparison between this law and Jim Crow is absolutely outrageous,” Owens said during a congressional hearing. “I’ll give you a few examples from my own life of what Jim Crow laws actually looked like.” “At the age of 12, my father allowed me to participate in a demonstration with college students in front of the segregated Florida State Theater, where because of our color, we could not enter. I was the youngest participant there,” he recounted. “Only 50 years later did I learn that my father parked across the street to watch and make sure I was safe.” “In the seventh grade, my school never received new books. Instead, we received books from the all-white school across town,” the Utah congressman said. “At service stations, there were white-men-only restrooms, white-women-only restrooms, and a filthy restroom in the back of the station for black Americans designated as ‘colored.'” “In addition, Jim Crow laws, like poll taxes, property tests, literacy tests, and violence and intimidation at the polls made it nearly impossible for black Americans to vote,” Owens stated. According to the congressman, Democrats are disingenuous when they mention Georgia’s voter ID laws, saying it’s a form of suppression. Residents have the ability to provide other government-issued documents to prove their identity, including utility bills, bank statements, or paychecks that include the person’s name and address. Even if a voter doesn’t have one of these documents, he or she can still vote provisionally, Owens stated. “By the way – 97% of Georgia voters already have a government-issued ID,” he explained. “What I find extremely offensive is the narrative from the left that black people are not smart enough, not educated enough, not desirous enough of education to do what every other culture and race does in this country: get an ID.” Owens stated “true racism” in the United States comes from the Democratic Party having low expectations of black Americans. That same thought process, according to the congressman, is also coming from the White House. “President Biden said of the Georgia law, this is ‘Jim Crow on steroids.’ With all due respect, Mr. President, you know better,” the congressman said. “It is disgusting and offensive to compare the actual voter suppression and violence of that era that we grew up in with a state law that only asks that people show their ID. This is the type of fear-mongering I would expect in the 1960s, not today.”  The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

daily_wire| I haven’t seen much humor in life during the past year or so, but one thing that has been uproariously hilarious lately is the orchestrated media narrative that President Joe Biden is bipartisan and conciliatory. Please give me a moment to catch my breath. I think it was Karl Rove who recently observed that the media’s effective definition of bipartisan legislation is not that significant numbers of both parties’ lawmakers support a bill but that some poll somewhere shows that a large percentage of Americans of each party support some vaguely described initiative, even if zero Republican legislators support the actual bill. You can frame a poll question to get the result you want. I can’t claim to be prophetic for having warned in my last book that if Democrats were to recapture the presidency, they would launch the most radical agenda in modern times. Indeed, you would have to have been almost blind or willfully naive to think otherwise. Yet never-Trumpers and many Democrats denied the radical wing of the party would have that much influence. But here we are. Saying “I told you so” doesn’t give me much solace. Whoever is pulling Biden’s strings was able to get him elected using the carefully crafted message that he was a moderate, especially compared with Bernie Sanders. These same puppet masters are now imposing their will, and they mean to complete former President Barack Obama’s fundamental transformation of this nation, which is quite fitting considering that he is one of the key masters and probably the main one. Many of us cautioned that they would try to pack the Supreme Court, and complacent scoffers waived their hands at us dismissively. But now Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Jerry Nader are set to offer legislation to add four more seats to the court and fill them with liberal-activist justices who would convert the court to a rubber stamp for the Left’s unconstitutional measures, rather than maintain it as a critical, nonpartisan check on excesses of the political branches. Do they have your attention yet? Please don’t say this is renegade Democratic lawmakers, not Biden. You know better, notwithstanding his previous comments that it would be a “boneheaded” move and a terrible, terrible idea. He’s the leader of the party. Then there’s Biden’s radical reversal of Trump’s border policies, which were designed to restore a sane and orderly immigration system. Biden has single-handedly caused a crisis at the border by incentivizing migrants to come here with promises of monetary benefits, health benefits, and sanctuary. Why would any nation-respecting president engage in such reckless behavior to the detriment of United States citizens and then pretend that this rush to the border is Trump’s fault or the result of certain “root causes” in the migrants’ home countries? By root causes, does he mean undemocratic, tyrannical governments — the kind that he and Democrats are trying to usher in here? And how about their constant stirring of the racial pot? Biden and the Democrats are firmly behind this disturbing wokeness trend now dominating our culture, as evidenced by Biden’s nomination of Kristen Clarke to head the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. As Sens. Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz demonstrated in their questioning of Clarke at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, Clarke supported measures to defund the police, despite claiming she now opposes them. Media fact-checkers are scrambling to deny the obvious, but it’s pretty hard to sell that narrative when Clarke penned an op-ed titled “I Prosecuted Police Killings. Defund the Police — But Be Strategic.” If Biden (or his handlers) isn’t pushing an extremist, race-laced agenda, why would he nominate someone so obviously obsessed with race? As former House Speaker Newt Gingrich noted, those who are pushing to defund the police are at war with Western civilization. That’s not all. Biden’s United Nations ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, believes and preaches that the United States is guilty of systemic racism. She told the Human Rights Council that “the original sin of slavery weaved white supremacy into our founding documents.” She added, “We have to acknowledge that we are an imperfect union — and have been since the beginning — and every day we strive to make ourselves more perfect, and more just.” She said that this “imperfect union” must approach issues of “equity and justice at the global scale … with humility.” She actually told this council, which includes such human rights abusers as China, Cuba, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and North Korea, that the United States needs to “engage trailblazing groups like yours” to “improve.” Kind of makes Obama’s notorious world apology tour look like a paean to America as founded. Note also Biden’s incendiary rhetoric about Georgia’s election integrity bill, which is designed not to suppress minority voters, as maliciously claimed, but to ensure fairness in the election process. Biden referred to the law as “Jim Crow in the 21st Century,” “Jim Crow on steroids” and “an atrocity.” Remember that during Jim Crow, blacks were threatened and beaten, and their houses sometimes burned down, to keep them from voting. The main provisions of the Georgia law impose voter identification requirements for absentee ballots and limit the use of ballot drop boxes. It is undeniably insulting and patronizing to minorities to imply that they can’t be expected to produce personal identification to vote. Know that some 70% of blacks reportedly support voter ID laws. If none of this strikes you as particularly radical, then what do you think of Biden’s proposed multitrillion-dollar “infrastructure” bill that is only marginally about infrastructure? Trump haters would have us believe that they just wanted to have the adults back in charge of our government. Well, if deliberately bankrupting the United States and destroying the U.S. dollar is adult behavior, I’d prefer adolescents at the helm.

daily_wire| Despite all the rhetoric about Georgia’s voter integrity law being the “new Jim Crow” and an egregious affront to human rights, the production for “Black Panther II” will not be moving out of the Peach State. In an op-ed published in Shadow and Act, director Ryan Coogler harshly condemned the law in Georgia while simultaneously resisting the urge to boycott the state. “The fight for full enfranchisement is fundamental to the African-American struggle in this country and to this country’s claim to functioning democracy,” he began. “As an African-American, and as a citizen, I oppose all attempts, explicit and otherwise, to shrink the electorate and reduce access to the ballot. I say this as I return to Georgia, a state that holds a special place in my heart. I lived in Atlanta for eight months while filming my last movie. I have long looked forward to returning. But, when I was informed of the passage of SB202 in the state, and its ramifications for the state’s voters, I was profoundly disappointed.” “While I wished to turn my concern into action, I could not do so without first being educated on the specifics of Georgia,” he continued. “Having now spoken with voting rights activists in the state, I have come to understand that many of the people employed by my film, including all the local vendors and businesses we engage, are the very same people who will bear the brunt of SB202. For those reasons, I will not be engaging in a boycott of Georgia. What I will be doing is using my voice to emphasize the effects of SB202, its shameful roots in Jim Crow, and doing all I can to support organizations fighting voter suppression here in the state.” Coogler then listed the many features of Georgia’s voter integrity bill; he did not explain how any of them might specifically target black Americans (many of whom actually support the measures put in place). Though he will not be moving production out of Georgia, he held firm to his commitment to fight the law. “Our film [Black Panther II] is staying in Georgia,” he concluded. “Additionally, I have made a personal commitment to raise awareness about ways to help overturn this harmful bill, and continue to get educated on this matter from people on the ground. I will encourage everyone working with me to tap in with the local community directly affected by Senate Bill 202 and to leverage their influence and resources to aid in the fight for this particular and essential pillar of democracy.” In a statement to Newsweek, Fair Fight, the voter organization founded by Stacey Abrams, told Hollywood to “stay and fight” the new law as opposed to boycotting the state. “Brian Kemp and Georgia Republican lawmakers are singularly responsible for any job that is lost and any dollar that goes out of Georgia, because they prioritized suppressing voters of color over the economic well-being of all Georgians,” Fair Fight spokesman Seth Bringman told Newsweek. “We urge events, productions, and businesses to come to Georgia and support the very communities that will [sic] whose access to the ballot will be hurt by Senate Bill 202. Come to Georgia and speak out against voter suppression. Stay and fight,” the statement added. Earlier this week, actor Will Smith and director Antoine Fuqua announced that they would be moving production of the upcoming runaway slave thriller “Emancipation” from the state of Georgia to Louisiana, costing an estimated $15 million in taxes.

daily_wire| An organization founded by failed gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams has called upon Hollywood to continue standing against Georgia’s voter integrity laws while not hurting the state economically. In a statement to Newsweek, Fair Fight, the voter organization founded by Stacy Abrams, told Hollywood to “stay and fight” the new law as opposed to cutting and running. “Brian Kemp and Georgia Republican lawmakers are singularly responsible for any job that is lost and any dollar that goes out of Georgia, because they prioritized suppressing voters of color over the economic well-being of all Georgians,” Fair Fight spokesman Seth Bringman told Newsweek. “We urge events, productions, and businesses to come to Georgia and support the very communities that will [sic] whose access to the ballot will be hurt by Senate Bill 202. Come to Georgia and speak out against voter suppression. Stay and fight,” the statement added. After maligning Georgia’s voter integrity law, prompting calls for boycotts, Stacey Abrams and other Democrats in the Peach State were alarmed after the MLB pulled the All-Star game from Atlanta. “Like many Georgians, I am disappointed that the MLB is relocating the All-Star game; however, I commend the players, owners and League commissioner for speaking out,” said Abrams in an early April statement. “I urge others in positions of leadership to do so as well. As I have stated, I respect boycotts, although I don’t want to see Georgia families hurt by lost events and jobs. Georgians targeted by voter suppression will be hurt as opportunities go to other states. We should not abandon the victims of GOP malice and lies – we must stand together.” “Georgia Republicans must renounce the terrible damage they have caused to our voting system and the harm they have inflicted on our economy,” she added. “Our corporate community must get off the sidelines as full partners in this fight, acknowledging that the provisions of SB 2020 do not expand voting rights. They restrict those rights, affecting employees and consumers alike. And leaders must publicly support the voting rights provisions in the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to mitigate the harm being done in Georgia and other states.” Earlier this week, actor Will Smith and director Antoine Fuqua announced that they would be moving production of the upcoming runaway slave thriller “Emancipation” from the state of Georgia to Louisiana, costing an estimated $15 million in taxes. “At this moment in time, the Nation is coming to terms with its history and is attempting to eliminate vestiges of institutional racism to achieve true racial justice,” Will Smith and director Antoine Fuqua said in a joint statement to Deadline. “We cannot in good conscience provide economic support to a government that enacts regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access. The new Georgia voting laws are reminiscent of voting impediments that were passed at the end of Reconstruction to prevent many Americans from voting. Regrettably, we feel compelled to move our film production work from Georgia to another state.” As The Daily Wire’s Ian Haworth reported, the voter integrity law does not discriminate against black people and even contains policies that black Americans support, such as voter ID requirements.

daily_wire| The Hollywood machine has continued its assault on the state of Georgia over its voter integrity law. In an open letter, titled “We Stand For Democracy,” industry titans like Netflix, ViacomCBS, Apple, Amazon, George Clooney, George Lucas, and David Geffen all maligned voter integrity laws as a restriction of Democracy. The letter did not expressly mention Georgia by name, but it was spearheaded by former American Express CEO Ken Chennault and Merck CEO Ken Frazier, who both released an ad in The New York Times recently calling on corporate America to oppose the law. More from The Hollywood Reporter (THR): Among the companies attaching their names to the letter were Netflix, ViacomCBS, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Live Nation Entertainment. Individuals signing the letter included notable entertainment figures JJ Abrams, George Clooney, Channing Dungey, Lee Daniels, Larry David, David Geffen, Demi Lovato, Peter Chernin, George Lucas, Samuel L. Jackson, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Shonda Rhimes, Shari Redstone and David Zaslav, as well as corporate leaders like Warren Buffett, Mike Bloomberg and Kenneth Cole. The letter, which was organized by former American Express CEO Ken Chennault and Merck CEO Ken Frazier, was published as a two-page advertising spread in Wednesday’s New York Times and Washington Post. While not calling out Georgia by name, it called out efforts to restrict voting access (Georgia passed a restrictive voting bill a few weeks ago, with dozens of other states weighing similar bills). “For American democracy to work for any of us, we must ensure the right to vote for all of us,” the letter reads. “We all should feel a responsibility to defend the right to vote, and oppose any discriminatory legislation or measures that restrict or prevent any eligible voter from having an equal or fair opportunity to cast a ballot.” Given how boycotts in the state of Georgia, or any other state pushing a voter integrity law, could cause a massive anti-Democrat backlash, the letter refrains from calling for a boycott. Earlier this week, actor Will Smith and director Antoine Fuqua announced that they would be moving production of the upcoming runaway slave thriller “Emancipation” from the state of Georgia to Louisiana, costing an estimated $15 million in taxes. “At this moment in time, the Nation is coming to terms with its history and is attempting to eliminate vestiges of institutional racism to achieve true racial justice,” Will Smith and director Antoine Fuqua said in a joint statement to Deadline. “We cannot in good conscience provide economic support to a government that enacts regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access. The new Georgia voting laws are reminiscent of voting impediments that were passed at the end of Reconstruction to prevent many Americans from voting. Regrettably, we feel compelled to move our film production work from Georgia to another state.” Despite the Left’s insistence that Georgia’s new election integrity law discriminates against minorities, the evidence says otherwise. In fact, many black voters support some of the proposed regulations, such as the voter ID requirement. “Nearly 70% of black people living in America support laws that require prospective voters to provide an ID, such as a driver’s license, before being allowed to cast their ballot,” reported The Daily Wire. “It turns out that the vast majority of black people in America — the very individuals Joe Biden assures us are victims of racism under voter ID laws — think it’s perfectly reasonable to require some form of proof that you are who you say you are before voting.” Related: Will Smith’s Movie ‘Emancipation’ Leaves Georgia Over Voting Law, Will Lose $15 Million In Tax Breaks The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

daily_wire| In recent weeks, the topic of boycotting has remained in the forefront of the national conversation as companies pander to the Left and take a hard stance against certain conservative values. As conservatives weigh the idea of implementing boycotts of their own, the core principles of open debate should be remembered. After recent voter ID legislation passed in Georgia — laws Democrat leaders compared to Jim Crow — leading corporations spoke out. Some went further than talk, such as Major League Baseball, which pulled its All-Star game out of the state and moved it to Colorado in protest.  When corporations become involved in denouncing certain groups of people and their values, they do the work of normalizing such behavior. This is how a society is formed wherein the loud voices of culture and consumerism drown out the individual citizen and tell them that their ideas are not valued. Conservatives not only spoke out against the incorrect statements made by many on the Left about the Georgia voting laws, but they have also begun discussing potential responses to such efforts by companies who seem to want conservative principles to disappear.  The “woke” culture seems to call out anyone in an established position who appears to side with conservatism. The canceling nature of the far Left pushes people out of the circle if they do not agree with the views accepted by the broader culture. Now, some on the Right have encouraged boycotts of their own as a necessary means of response to industries which have mistreated conservatives in one way or another. The question of when conservatives should take the leap and get into the practice of boycotting is one that has been a debate for some time. The boycotting of businesses and people based on political views is not something that ultimately promotes the idea of an open society strengthened by vigorous debate, and many have pushed back against it. But when ideas are shut down and individuals are not allowed to occupy the same space as those who think differently, it is hard to think of an alternative route. Americans will always have divisions, but a country that is divided down to its core cannot stand. This doesn’t mean that differences of opinion should not be expressed. Diversity of thought in the United States is a good thing and can lead to important conversations and lasting compromise. The question remains as to how much division is a natural part of a free society, and how much will result in the silencing of ideas. People can only be ostracized so many times before they stop engaging with society at all in fear of retribution for their less popular beliefs. For many, the more desirable and enticing option may be to shut the door on members of the opposite party after new areas of influence are created on the Right, but that would be a mistake. It matters that conservatives take the high road. If the Right truly believes in the original ideals of the founding of the United States — that freedom of speech and expression are vital and should not be taken away — those principles must apply to boycotts. Any new structure should refrain from the “wokeism” that would silence anyone who disagrees. It should invite the outsiders in. America has always been a place of lively rhetoric and intense debate. It’s when debate ceases altogether that the deterioration of culture begins. The theme of any newly-formed entity on the Right should be one of strong conservative values, but it should include the sentiment that anyone who wants to come into the circle and discuss ideas should be welcomed. In The Federalist No. 10, James Madison wrote about factions and the appropriate response to the threat they pose. He described a faction as “a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.” He discussed the connection between freedom and faction — that factions don’t exist without liberty, but that doesn’t mean Americans should get rid of liberty. “Liberty is to faction, what air is to fire, an aliment without which it instantly expires. But it could not be a less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of air, which is essential to animal life because it imparts to fire its destructive agency.” The same concept should be applied to conservatives creating new groups of their own. Liberty must remain and be the driving force behind any new space that is created — and anyone who wants to come along and have a discussion should find an open door.

daily_wire| Students at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., were asked about specific measures regarding voting integrity. They agreed with the measures — until they learned they were from the new Georgia voting law. Campus Reform traveled to the university with a camera to read students the component of Georgia’s new law, finding that “Most students were widely supportive of the bill, applauding its voter expansion.” One student, who is white, early in the video said she was from Georgia and that there was “a lot of voter suppression” in Georgia, adding that she believed there needed to be a lot more “freedom and accessibility” for voters, such as “extending hours.” Campus Reform’s video reporter Addison Smith then explained to the students some measures of “new legislation going around,” which would require weekend early voting for two Saturdays instead of just one, giving counties the option to expand early voting for two Sundays, clarify voting hours, ban electioneering within 150 feet of a polling location, and require identification to ensure people can’t cast multiple ballots. The students agreed with those measures. “Making sure people aren’t casting more than one vote sounds kinda commonsense to me,” said one student. “I think that allowing voters more time to vote is never a bad thing,” said another, who also appeared to be in favor of voter identification to prevent illegal voting. “The ability to vote on the weekend, specifically, makes a lot of sense,” said yet another student. The student who claimed there was “a lot of voter suppression” in Georgia also agreed on the measures relating to early voting and electioneering, but fell back on the left-wing talking point that “not everyone has access to an ID or the ability to get one,” adding that “not everyone has a static location where they live.” Smith then asked the students if the bill he described would be a good substitute for the Georgia law. The student from Georgia said “yeah, anything’s better than that.” When informed that he actually described the Georgia bill, the student barely reacted, claiming the bill also included “less locations” to vote. She then claimed it was “classist” to require an ID to vote and that three years wasn’t enough time for people to get an ID. When Smith told her that more than 70% of black voters support showing an ID at the polls, she said “Okay, I don’t.” Other students were surprised to learn what was actually in the Georgia bill, admitting they hadn’t actually read it. One student tried to claim people weren’t deliberately misrepresenting the bill, but when asked if the measures Smith described amounted to “Jim Crow on steroids,” she changed her tune. As The Daily Wire’s Ian Haworth previously reported, there is a disconnect between what Democrats and their media supporters have said about the bill and what it actually does. The Georgia law expands early voting and requires voter IDs. It does not prohibit people from getting food or drink while waiting in line, they just can’t receive it from candidates or staff (poll workers can hand it out and people can order or bring it themselves).

breitbart| Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian called Georgia’s new voting law “unacceptable” in a memo to employees on Wednesday. New voting ID requirements, dropbox restrictions, and early voting access signed into law by Georgia Governor Brian Kemp last Thursday continue to draw controversy. The same day, President Joe Biden called the measures “un-American” and “sick,” making “Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle.” Civil rights groups have filed lawsuits against the state of Georgia, saying it was an example of “blatant racism, represents politics at its very worst and is clearly illegal.” On Wednesday, 72 black executives signed an open letter calling for American corporations to join the resistance. On Wednesday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian did just that. In a memo circulated to its employee and posted to the Delta “news hub,” Bastian criticized the new law. While he took credit on behalf of Delta and other businesses for helping to “eliminating the most suppressive tactics that some had proposed,” he maintained that “the final bill is unacceptable and does not match Delta’s values.” “The right to vote is sacred,” Bastian wrote. “It is fundamental to our democracy and those rights not only need to be protected, but easily facilitated in a safe and secure manner.” Bastian went a step further, saying “the entire rationale for this bill was based on a lie: that there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 elections.” He called the idea an “excuse” used across the country to “restrict voting rights.” “There is much work ahead,” the memo continued, assuring employees those at the airline “stand together in our commitment to protect and facilitate your precious right to vote.” Bastian promised the company would be “working with leaders across the political spectrum in states nationwide” and “monitoring legislation in Congress” to that end. “I know this result in Georgia has caused frustration, anger and pain for many members of our Delta family,” Bastian said. “I commit to you that as we move forward, Delta will continue to do everything in our power to hear and protect your voice and your rights, both in Georgia and nationwide.” Governor Kemp has repeatedly contested the bill’s framing, saying those who oppose the Election Integrity Act simply have not read it, and that SB 202 “expands early voting and secures our vote-by-mail system to protect the integrity of our elections.”
breitbart| Coca-Cola Company chairman and CEO James Quincey said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Power Lunch” that the recently passed Georgia voting law “is wrong and needs to be remedied.” Quincey said, “Let me get crystal clear and unequivocal this legislation is unacceptable. It is a step backward. It does not promote principles we have stood for in Georgia around broad access to voting, around voter convenience, about ensuring election integrity. This is frankly just a step backward. We have spent many decades promoting within Georgia a better society and better environment for business, and this is a step backward. Our position remains the same. This legislation is wrong and needs to be remedied. We’ll continue to advocate in both private and even more clearly in public.” He added, “We believe that’s acceptable for the citizens of Georgia and we are coming out more clearly saying that this is wrong and needs to change. The reality is many things are improved and done and achieved in private without having to take a public stand. In this case, it’s not worked clearly, and so we’re being more forceful in our public position, even more than we were earlier this week, and will continue to advocate for change in Georgia.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
breitbart| During Friday’s broadcast of “CNN Newsroom,” Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) said efforts such as in her state and Georgia to shore up election integrity were “about race.” Jackson Lee argued there was only “minute if at best” fraud in Georgia and Texas in the 2020 election. “Explain, if you can, how the changes in Texas make it harder to vote,” host Jim Sciutto posed to Jackson Lee. “Is it about race? Yes, it’s about race. Is the SB 7 bill about race? Yes, in Texas, it is about race. And that is tragic,” Jackson Lee emphasized. “And the reason why I say that is they had a solution running for a problem. There were no charges of the question of fraud both in Georgia and in Texas. There was no widespread fraud. There was no discernible fraud. It was minute, if at best. So we asked the legislature, when schoolchildren don’t have enough resources to make up for this terrible pandemic, why are they focused immediately on voting rights? It was because they lost the 2020 election, rather than getting back on their feet, putting their issues forward and running. This is truly about race. What do you think about a poll watcher that is not anyone officially connected to the poll, a poll watcher designated by parties having a videotape and watching voters while they’re voting? Can you tell me what good news is that? It is intimidation. I’ve seen it. I’ve seen it in my congressional district, which is a majority-minority district.” She added, “And so, yes, I don’t believe this has anything to do with voting rights.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
breitbart| Amazon has joined the chorus of corporate leaders attacking Georgia’s election law by calling on states to “follow Virginia’s leadership,” instead. According to Amazon spokesperson and former Obama Press Secretary Jay Carney, “efforts to disenfranchise black people and other minorities continue to this day.” “It has been fifty-six years since the Voting Rights Act became law, yet efforts to disenfranchise black people and other minorities continue to this day,” said Amazon spokesperson and former Obama White House press secretary Jay Carney in a statement on Thursday. “The ability to vote is one of the most prized fundamental rights in American democracy, and Amazon supports policies that protect and expand those rights,” Carney added.  The Amazon spokesperson went on to praise “the Commonwealth of Virginia” for its Voting Rights Act of Virginia, which was approved by Virginia Governor Ralph Northam (D) on Wednesday. “I am happy that the home state of our second headquarters, the Commonwealth of Virginia, is taking monumental and historic action to enhance voter protection,” Carney wrote. “This truly is a model that other states and Congress should follow to ensure all Americans can participate in free, fair, and secure elections.” “Amazon already has 27,000 employees in the Commonwealth, and we are looking forward to hiring 25,000 more as we grow our HQ2,” he added. “Innovative and thoughtful policies like this are one of the many reasons we are proud of our current and expanding footprint in Virginia.” Carney then called out “other states,” who he alleges are trying to restrict voting rights, and urged them to “follow Virginia’s leadership.” “We oppose efforts in other states aimed at restricting the ability of Americans to vote, and we call on those states to follow Virginia’s leadership by expanding voter protection instead,” Carney said. Last week, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp (R) signed a bill aimed at improving state election integrity. The bill seeks to strengthen voting rules in the Peach State by limiting the number of ballot drop boxes and establishing photo ID requirements for absentee voters, among other things. The move has sparked outrage among left-wing activists, who consider the legislation an attack on minorities, suggesting that members of the black community cannot figure out how to acquire a photo ID, among other bizarre assumptions. On Wednesday, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian called Georgia’s new voting law “unacceptable” in a memo to employees. That same day, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey echoed those sentiments, calling the recently-passed law “unacceptable,” “wrong,” and “a step backward.” Meanwhile, Major League Baseball (MLB) has reacted to Georgia’s voting reform law by announcing it will move its All-Star Game from Atlanta. Apple CEO Tim Cook has also reacted, telling Axios that voting should be “easier than ever,” in the modern age. President Joe Biden has also chimed in, calling the legislation “un-American” and “sick,” making “Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle.” You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Facebook and Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, on Parler @alana, and on Instagram.
breitbart| Students at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. expressed support for voting reform when asked what they thought about specific measures taken to ensure election integrity — then they found out the reforms are from Georgia’s new voting law. Campus Reform reporter Addison Smith read parts of the new voting law to Georgetown students to get their reaction to it — before telling them that the legislation is from Georgia. “We’re from Georgia, so there’s a lot of voter suppression in Georgia, and I think that there needs to be a lot more freedom and accessibility towards polls and extending hours,” said one student being interviewed with her friend. “The, like, original system was created because, like, they thought the populace was, like, too dumb,” said another student. Watch Below:  Smith explained to the students that “there’s some legislation going around,” which would “require weekend early voting for two Saturdays,” instead of just one, “give counties the option to expand it two Sundays,” “clarify the polling hours,” “ban electioneering within 150 feet” of a polling location, and “require voter identification” so that people cannot cast multiple ballots. When asked if they would support legislation like that, many students agreed. “Yeah, I mean, making sure that people aren’t casting more than one vote, that sounds kind of common sense to me,” said one student. “Yeah, I think that allowing voters more time to vote is never a bad thing, I think that making sure that they can verify their identity is also not a bad thing so that there’s no, like, illegal voting happening or anything like that,” reacted another. A third student, who was white, said, “definitely the first two,” but expressed that she did not support voter identification, claiming, “not everyone has access to an ID or has the ability to get one,” and that “not everybody has a static location where they live.” But when Smith asked the students, “what if I told you that this actually was the Georgia voting bill?” the students appeared shocked. And when asked if the legislation sounds like “Jim Crow on steroids,” one student said, “no, I guess not.” President Joe Biden has described Georgia’s election integrity bill as “Jim Crow on steroids.” One student, however, maintained that the concept of voter identification is “classist.” “A poll came out that showed 70 percent of black Americans do support voter ID,” Smith countered. “A lot of people are calling it ‘Jim Crow,’ suppression — but the majority of black Americans actually support it.” “Okay, I don’t,” the student replied. Georgia’s new election integrity legislation has sparked outrage among left-wing activists, who consider the legislation an attack on minorities, suggesting that members of the black community cannot figure out how to acquire a photo ID, among other bizarre assumptions.

breitbart| The executive director of Heritage Action praised the new Georgia “Election Integrity Act of 2021,” signed into law by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp on Thursday evening, as a model for other states to follow. “Georgia legislators have been leaders in the fight to protect our elections. These lawmakers have worked tirelessly to make Georgia’s elections more secure, fair, and transparent while promoting voters’ rights, and today they achieved a historic victory,” Heritage Action Executive Director Jessica Anderson said in a statement released late Thursday. “Reforms to make voter ID requirements and early voting access more consistent statewide, modernize the state’s voting rolls, and ensure robust oversight of voting and elections will protect Georgia’s votes and make the state a model for the rest of the country,” Anderson added. With the current session of the Georgia General Assembly scheduled to end next week on March 31, SB 202 moved with lightning speed from a bill scheduled for a floor vote on the Georgia House of Representatives to a statute in a matter of hours on Thursday. Early on Thursday afternoon, the bill passed the Georgia House of Representatives in a partisan 100 to 75 vote. Quickly, the bill was taken up by the Georgia State Senate where it passed in a partisan 34 to 20 vote. The bill then moved quickly to the office of Gov. Brian Kemp, who quickly signed it into law late Thursday afternoon. Georgia Democrats reacted to the bill’s passage and Kemp’s signing it into law unfavorably, as Breitbart News reported: Martin Luther King III, son of the slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., called the law “racist” in an appearance on CNN Thursday night. Those early reactions indicate the national battle between Republicans, who characterize bills currently under consideration in several other state legislatures as election integrity reforms, and Democrats and most mainstream media outlets, who characterize them as “voter suppression,” is about to heat up. The national attention on election law legislation is also heating up as H.R. 1, which was passed through the U.S. House of Representatives this month, has moved to the U.S. Senate for consideration. Democrats have named that bill “The For the People Act,” while Republicans and conservatives call it “The Corrupt Politicians Act.” One key provision of the new law, whose overarching purpose is to “comprehensively revise elections and voting,” is a direct rebuke of current Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, whose controversial decisions and open political combat with former President Donald Trump defined the 2020 presidential election in the state. For decades, the five-member Georgia State Election Board has been responsible for the administration of elections in the state, and the secretary of state has been the most influential member of that five-member board. With the signing of S.B. 202, “The Election Integrity Act of 2021” into law on Thursday, the secretary of state has now been removed as a voting member of the state election board permanently. Key provisions of the bill reduce the role of the secretary of state in the administration of elections. The bill: Another key provision of the new law limits the number and location of drop boxes. An estimated 600,000 vote-by-mail absentee ballots (out of five million votes cast) were deposited in more than 300 drop boxes established throughout the state in the 2020 presidential election. According to the Emergency Election Rule promulgated by the Georgia State Election Board in July 2020, documentation of the transfer of ballots from these drop boxes to the local county registrars or their designees was supposed to be memorialized in ballot transfer control forms. When asked by Breitbart News in December about the number, location, and status of these ballot transfer forms, a spokesperson for the secretary of state said they had no idea and that it was the responsibility of the state’s 159 counties to keep track of these ballot transfer forms: The new law states, “the board of registrars may establish additional sites as additional registrar’s offices or places of registration for the purpose of receiving absentee ballots … and for the purpose of voting absentee ballots advance … provided that any such site is a building that is a branch of the county courthouse, a courthouse annex, a government service center providing general government services, another government building generally accessible to the public, or a location building that is used as an election day polling place, notwithstanding that such location building is not a government building.” In other words, the placement of drop boxes outside of official government building locations is prohibited. In addition, the number of drop boxes is limited: Some supporters of the new law say that it prohibits private funding for the administration of elections, the controversial practice that many Republicans believe resulted in turning local election offices around the country — and Georgia in particular — into Get-Out-the-Vote arms of the Democratic Party. As Breitbart News reported: While the new Georgia law signed by Gov. Kemp on Thursday prohibits local election superintendents from accepting private funding for the administration of elections, one election integrity expert says it contains a loophole. Section 9 (b) of the 95-page law states, “No superintendent shall take or accept any funding, grants, or gifts from any source other than from the governing authority of the county or municipality, the State of Georgia, or the federal government.” Phill Kline, executive director of the Amistad Project of the Thomas More Society, told Breitbart News that the provision’s failure to explicitly prohibit county governments, municipalities, or the State of Georgia from accepting private funding is a loophole that should be closed. Kline stated that a bill passed by the Arizona House of Representatives this month that specifically prohibits any state government, county government, or municipal entity from accepting or expending private funds for the administration of elections is “far superior” to the new Georgia statute. Kline’s critique may have influenced the final version of the bill that became law on Thursday, which included a new provision. Section 9 (c) of the new law states, “The State Election Board shall study and report to the General Assembly a proposed method for accepting donations intended to facilitate the administration of elections and a method for an equitable distribution of such donations state wide by October 1, 2021.” Heritage Action’s Anderson praised the work of grassroots activists in securing the passage of the election reform legislation. “Grassroots activists across Georgia worked with lawmakers every step of the way to restore trust and transparency in the electoral process — every voter has the right to trust that their vote counts. Heritage Action is proud to have partnered with over 20,000 activists in the state to help secure these reforms, and we look forward to SB 202 being signed into law,” Anderson said.
breitbart| The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) announced on Tuesday it is suing Georgia over its election integrity measure, which Gov. Brian Kemp (R) signed into law last week. “BREAKING: We’re suing Georgia over its illegal voter suppression law,” the ACLU announced on Tuesday, claiming the law violates the First Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, Fifteenth Amendment, and the Voting Rights Act. “This legislation is a clear attack on voters of color. We’ll see Georgia Governor Kemp in court,” the ACLU warned:   The lawsuit plaintiffs are being represented by ACLU and WilmerHale, and the lawsuit itself alleges that S.B. 202 violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, as well as the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as the ACLU detailed in its announcement. Far-left politicians — from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to President Joe Biden — have continued to characterize the law as a relic of the Jim Crow era, spreading false assertions about fundamental aspects of the piece of legislation. “What I’m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It’s sick. It’s sick … deciding that you’re going to end voting at five o’clock when working people are just getting off work,” Biden said last week, later asserting the Georgia law cut voting hours “so working people can’t cast their vote after their shift is over.” Biden’s claim triggered a fact check from the Washington Post, which issued Four Pinocchios, as the law does not affect Election Day hours in Georgia. Furthermore, the changes to early voting actually expand opportunities to voters across the state, as Heritage Action pointed out:  A recent National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) survey found a majority of likely voters disagreeing with key aspects of the “For the People Act,” a Democrat-supported bill that would effectively strip states of their ability to implement basic election integrity measures, such as requiring voter ID. Seventy-seven percent favor requiring voters to show a valid photo ID when voting. Even a majority of Democrats, 61 percent, agreed. The case is African Methodist Episcopal Church, v. Kemp, No. 1:21-cv-02184 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division.
breitbart| Major League Baseball is moving its All-Star Game from Atlanta in response to a recently passed voting reform law in Georgia, ESPN reports. MLB issued a press release announcing the move on Friday.  ESPN’s lead MLB reporter Jeff Passan also shared the news:  Last month, Major League Baseball Players Association President Tony Clark said that his union members wanted to relocate the game after Georgia passed the voter reform bill. “Players are very much aware” of the Georgia voting bill, Clark told the Boston Globe. “As it relates to the All-Star Game, we have not had a conversation with the league on that issue – if there is an opportunity to, we would look forward to having that conversation.” As Breitbart’s Warner Todd Huston reports: There had been reports that MLB might choose to use the Atlanta-based All-Star Game as a platform for social justice in response to the voter reform bill. However, apparently, those plans changed. Notably, MLB’s decision to move the game flies in the face of the advice given by 2018 failed Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who advised against relocating the game due to the economic damage it could do to “voters of color.” MLB has not yet said where this year’s All-Star Game will take place.
breitbart| Heritage Action debunked six key myths touted by Democrats regarding Georgia’s recently-passed election integrity law, which the radical left has falsely described as a voter suppression bill harkening to the era of Jim Crow. The left has continued to mischaracterize the SB 202, which Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) signed into law last week, ushering in basic election integrity measures such as requiring a valid ID to vote via an absentee ballot. However, influential Democrats, including President Joe Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), have continued to spread a series of falsehoods regarding state election integrity efforts across the nation, as well as the Georgia law specifically. Schumer even called such proposals “one of the greatest threats we have to modern democracy in America.” Heritage Action has continued to address the narrative and released a “Myth vs. Fact” sheet combating the top myths touted by Democrats. The organization identified the voter suppression narrative as one of the primary myths and explained the Georgia bill “actually preserves or expands ballot access in several important ways,” including by increasing the mandatory days for early weekend voting: Democrats also claim the law eliminates “Souls to the Polls,” suppressing minority votes, but this, again, is false. Heritage Action explained the Georgia law “was silent on Sunday early voting days prior to SB 202, and in 2020 only 16 of 159 counties offered early voting on Sundays.” In reality, the law “explicitly provides the option of holding early voting on two Sundays for all localities,” thereby increasing mandatory days of early weekend voting. Heritage Action also tackled the myth of Georgia “suppressing” votes with new voter ID requirements, noting the vast majority of registered voters, 97 percent, already have a valid form of identification and adding that one can be obtained for free. “The voter ID requirement replaces the state’s controversial signature match program that led to the disqualification of thousands of votes in 2020,” the organization said, noting the tremendous popularity of the voter ID requirement for absentee ballots among Peach State voters, with nearly three-quarters of Georgia voters supporting it, including 63 percent of black voters. The organization also tackled the critiques over drop boxes for absentee voting, reminding voters the drop boxes used in 2020 did “not exist a year ago.” Under SB 202, they become an official part of Georgia elections, available across all counties and under supervision. Other myths debunked, via Heritage Action:     Nonetheless, leftists are continuing to urge influential persons and entities to fight against state election integrity efforts. Dozens of black business leaders recently signed a letter, urging corporations to use their influence to sway lawmakers. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian followed suit, criticizing Georgia’s election integrity law as “unacceptable” in a memo to employees on Wednesday.
breitbart| President Joe Biden advanced a false narrative about Georgia’s new election integrity law, claiming that it reduces voting hours, thereby compromising the ability of working-class Americans to go out and vote. This is a clear falsehood, as the law does not change Election Day hours and actually expands access for early voting, as the establishment media outlet, the Washington Post, pointed out in a fact-check, giving the commander-in-chief Four Pinocchios. Biden has spoken sharply against Georgia’s election law, which Gov. Brian Kemp (R) signed last week, repeating many of the talking points touted by far-left members of Congress, even referring to state election integrity efforts as “un-American” and “sick,” making “Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle.” “What I’m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It’s sick. It’s sick … deciding that you’re going to end voting at five o’clock when working people are just getting off work,” he said during last week’s news conference. The following day, Biden claimed the law ended voting hours early “so working people can’t cast their vote after their shift is over.” However, Biden’s assertions are not accurate. Election Day hours in Georgia, which are 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., have not changed. Those in line by 7 p.m. are permitted to cast their vote. “Nothing in the new law changes those rules,” the Washington Post reported. Georgia’s law did, however, make changes to early voting, but the Post explained that experts said the “net effect was to expand the opportunities to vote for most Georgians, not limit them”: Ultimately, the Post issued Four Pinocchios to Biden’s claim, emphasizing Election Day hours were not changed and the early voting changes actually expand access, as Heritage Action pointed out amid the left’s steam of false characterizations last week:  “President Biden’s misleading attacks are not supported by the facts: Georgia’s election reforms actually expand voting opportunities, extend early voting hours, and reduce wait times while promoting trust in the state’s election system,” Heritage Action executive director Jessica Anderson told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement. “Over 80 percent of Americans support these commonsense measures to protect our elections and uphold a fair, transparent voting process,” she continued, explaining that groups opposing basic voter protections are “actually sowing mistrust and suppressing Georgian votes.” “Georgia’s reforms increase voter confidence and should be the example for every state on how to make it easy to vote and hard to cheat,” Anderson added. “Every state should follow their lead.”
bipartisan_report| Voting rights lawyer Marc Elias and the Montana Democratic Party have sued Montana state authorities after Republican Governor Greg Gianforte signed two bills into law that impose new voting restrictions in the state. The bills end same-day voter registration and change requirements around voter ID, meaning that now some Montanans will need to present two separate forms of identification before casting their vote. No systematic issues were discovered with the previous voting parameters that were in place in Montana or anywhere else in the country, but Republicans have nevertheless rushed to restrict access to voting.    As summarized by Elias’s organization, the new Montana lawsuit “claims that both bills violate the Montana Constitution and asks the court to preliminarily and permanently stop the Secretary of State from enforcing the bills.” Sandi Luckey, who serves as executive director of the Montana Democratic Party, added as follows to CNN: ‘IN AMERICA, ALL ATTEMPTS TO SILENCE AMERICANS SHOULD BE MET WITH AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE. THE GOAL OF THE LAWSUIT IS TO STOP REPUBLICANS FROM SILENCING VOTERS, TO PROTECT FAIR ELECTIONS, AND THE FREEDOM TO VOTE FOR EVERYONE IN MONTANA.’ Elias has also helped bring court challenges against new voting restrictions in Iowa and Georgia. In Iowa, among other changes, Republican Governor Kim Reynolds recently signed legislation into law that cuts an hour from the time that polling places are open on Election Day, while in Georgia, Republican Governor Brian Kemp recently signed a bill that imposes new voter ID requirements for mail-in voting. Although no systematic issues were discovered with the electoral system anywhere in the country ahead of the implementation of these new restrictions, turnout surged in 2020 — and now, following high-profile Democratic victories, Republicans are imposing new hurdles. In Montana, Republican state. Rep. Sharon Greef — who sponsored the legislation that ended same-day voter registration — said that she wanted “to ensure good, clean elections,” which on its own is a remarkably meaningless phrase. How would she define a “good” and “clean” election? There’s no meaningful evidence of systematically “dirty” — meaning corrupted — elections anywhere in the country. Greef added at the time that “election officials should concentrate on one thing the day of the election and that is the election,” but there is no evidence that any systematic problems went unnoticed by Montana election officials. She’s reacting to imaginary problems. In Georgia, local authorities have faced steep pushback over the state’s new voting restrictions. Major League Baseball even announced that they’d be moving their planned All-Star Game out of the state in protest. Republicans, by and large, just keep metaphorically wringing their hands and pretending that there’s an election security problem where one doesn’t exist.
bipartisan_report| MyPillow guy and CEO Mike Lindell was one of the last faces to show up leaving the White House during the last administration. Talk about bad timing. At that time, he was bad-mouthing the voting machines provided in Georgia, Dominion Voting Systems. Then, Dominion sued him for $1.6 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. But it appears Lindell was a quick Donald Trump study and learned a few of the big guy’s wicked tricks.    Dominion’s lawsuit against Lindell was based upon him defaming the company with his false claims. The CEO said that Dominion’s machines flipped Trump votes over to President Joe Biden. On a live stream, Lindell announced that he was suing Dominion for $1.6 billion. He claimed that the reason the voting machines failed to launch was due to hackers: ‘MYPILLOW HAS JUST SUED DOMINION FOR $1.6 BILLION. HIS IS A FREE SPEECH CASE. THIS IS A FIRST AMENDMENT CASE. AND WHAT A DAY TO DO THIS ON THE SAME DAY OF LAUNCHING FRANK AND THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD ALL NIGHT LONG, DESTROYING, DESTROYING US. AND WE GOT LIVE TO YOU, WE GOT LIVE EARLY. YOU’RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO PUT IN YOUR PROFILES LIKE WE SAID UNTIL, UM, SOMETIME TODAY.’ In addition, MyPillow guy showed a digital counter on his live stream. He claimed it showed the number of people who accessed his site. However, that site was “unaccessible (sic) for most users.” Law professor Alan Dershowitz appeared on Lindell’s broadcast and threw his support against Dominion. Dershowitz spoke to The Daily Beast about the lawsuit: ‘I’VE BEEN ON CONFERENCE CALLS REPEATEDLY WITH [LINDELL’S] LEGAL TEAM, SOMETIMES LINDELL IS ON, SOMETIMES HE’S NOT. MY ROLE IS TO COME UP WITH IDEAS AS THEY PERTAIN TO THE FIRST AMENDMENT. I GIVE THEM CASES, AND I SUGGEST FIRST AMENDMENT THEORIES—MY ROLE IS LIMITED TO ADVISING ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUES AT HAND.’ The attorney continued: ‘OUR POSITION IS THAT DOMINION IS THE GOVERNMENT, FOR PURPOSES OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT. THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATED TO THEM THE MOST IMPORTANT GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTION, MAINLY COUNTING VOTES IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. AND THEY ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO CRITICISM IN THE EXACT SAME WAYS THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO CRITICISM IN THAT SITUATION.’ ‘AND CRITICISM OF HOW THE GOVERNMENT CONDUCTED A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS THE HIGHEST BAR PROTECTING THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO CRITICIZE SUCH ACTION.’ Dominion also sued Trump attorney Sidney Powell. She argued that the lawsuit should be dropped. The reason? No reasonable person would have believed her, The Forbes Magazine reported: ‘FORMER TRUMP LAWYER AND CONSPIRACY THEORIST SIDNEY POWELL MOVED TO DISMISS A LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST HER BY DOMINION VOTING SYSTEMS MONDAY, ARGUING HER EARLIER CLAIMS THAT DOMINION WAS INVOLVED IN AN ORCHESTRATED VOTER FRAUD EFFORT WERE SO OUTRAGEOUS THAT “REASONABLE PEOPLE WOULD NOT ACCEPT SUCH STATEMENTS AS FACT.”’ Watch MyPillow guy’s entire broadast in the video below: The Mueller Report Adventures: In Bite-Sizes on this Facebook page.

bipartisan_report| The lines between news and entertainment on television have blurred so much, perhaps “news” should be struck from some of the cable stations. Fox News became the megaphone for the ultra-right Republican Party years ago. Its hosts continue to spew out lies nearly as frequently as the last resident of the White House. But there may be severe consequences in store for Fox.    The election technology firm Smartmatic has sued Fox News in the New York State Supreme Court for $2.7 billion. The company refuted the cable station’s claim that it had covered the 2020 election “responsibly.” In addition, the media company claimed that Fox anchors just “played along” when its guests espoused election-related conspiracy theories. Smartmatic attorney J. Erik Connolly filed the brief filed in Court. It read, according to The New York Times: ‘THE FIRST AMENDMENT DOES NOT PROVIDE THE FOX DEFENDANTS A GET-OUT-OF-JAIL-FREE CARD. THE FOX DEFENDANTS DO NOT GET A DO-OVER WITH THEIR REPORTING NOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SUED.’ Three of Fox Corporation’s present and past hosts have been named for defaming the voting system company in the suit. They are Maria Bartiromo, Jeanine Pirro, and Lou Dobbs. These Fox hosts attacked Smartmatic and another voting company Dominion Voting Systems. According to the lawsuit, the aforementioned hosts spread baseless conspiracy theories after the presidential election. These three claimed that the companies “manipulated vote totals in contested states.” The hosts amplified Donald Trump’s former personal attorney Rudy Giuliani’s and attorney Sidney Powell’s conspiracy theories. The lawsuit claimed that these conspiracy theories ruined Smartmatic’s reputation, which is vital for its continuing business. It seems that the company only provided election technology in only one Georgia county during the election. Dominion sued Fox News, too, for $1.3 billion. Altogether, the companies’ lawsuits, if won, would mean a multi-billion-dollar loss for the media company. After Smartmatic filed the suit, Fox canceled Dobbs’ business program. Fox News released a statement that read: ‘THE FILING ONLY CONFIRMS OUR VIEW THAT THE SUIT IS MERITLESS AND FOX NEWS COVERED THE ELECTION IN THE HIGHEST TRADITION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT.’ Fox’s filed a motion along with the anchors. It argued that talking about Smartmatic was an integral part of “newsworthy” reporting.  Fox had no choice but to cover news related to the company during the election: ‘A PRESIDENT’S REFUSAL TO CONCEDE AN ELECTION AND HIS INSISTENCE THAT HIS OPPONENT’S VICTORY WAS NOT LEGITIMATE.’ Smartmatic responded when it filed its 120-page brief with the Court on Monday. It argued that Fox’s claim was merely “wishful thinking.” It added that  Fox’s argument did not cover Systematic “objectively or fairly,” Yahoo News reported: ‘THE FOX DEFENDANTS WEDDED THEMSELVES TO GIULIANI AND POWELL DURING THEIR PROGRAMS. THEY CANNOT DISTANCE THEMSELVES NOW.’ The Court has given Fox several weeks to argue against Systematic’s response. At that time, the judge will take into consideration whether to let the company’s case move forward. The Mueller Report Adventures: In Bite-Sizes on this Facebook page.

bipartisan_report| Actor/ producer Will Smith and director Antoine Fuqua have announced that they’re moving a planned film production out of Georgia in protest of a restrictive voting law recently signed by Georgia Republican Governor Brian Kemp. The law, among other problems, imposes new ID requirements on absentee voting, restricts the usage of absentee ballot drop boxes to business hours, criminalizes outside organizations providing food and water to voters standing in line — no matter how long — and more.    The Hollywood Reporter identified Smith and Fuqua’s moved film as the first “major production” to exit Georgia over the state’s new election restrictions. Georgia is known as a center for film productions involving major companies from Netflix to Marvel, and the movie that Fuqua and Smith had been set to craft in the state is known as Emancipation, with Smith starring as “Whipped Peter,” a real-life figure who is “known for being the subject of a series of photographs that starkly showed scars from being whipped while a slave,” as The Hollywood Reporter explains. The publication noted that the announcement “could have a cascading effect in the coming days or weeks and could put pressure on more productions to leave the state.” Smith and Fuqua commented as follows in a joint statement: ‘AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME, THE NATION IS COMING TO TERMS WITH ITS HISTORY AND IS ATTEMPTING TO ELIMINATE VESTIGES OF INSTITUTIONAL RACISM TO ACHIEVE TRUE RACIAL JUSTICE. WE CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE PROVIDE ECONOMIC SUPPORT TO A GOVERNMENT THAT ENACTS REGRESSIVE VOTING LAWS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO RESTRICT VOTER ACCESS. THE NEW GEORGIA VOTING LAWS ARE REMINISCENT OF VOTING IMPEDIMENTS THAT WERE PASSED AT THE END OF RECONSTRUCTION TO PREVENT MANY AMERICANS FROM VOTING. REGRETTABLY, WE FEEL COMPELLED TO MOVE OUR FILM PRODUCTION WORK FROM GEORGIA TO ANOTHER STATE.’ The Georgia legislation is poised to particularly impact marginalized communities like Black voters. For instance, it bans the usage of mobile polling places, which were used during the 2020 election cycle in Fulton County, a highly populated Atlanta-area jurisdiction with a large Black community. No systematic problems were discovered with Georgia’s election procedures before the implementation of this new legislation, which has already been hit with a few court challenges. One of the lawsuits was brought by the New Georgia Project, the Black Voters Matter Fund, and a student organization called Rise and has voting rights lawyer Marc Elias on the legal team.
bipartisan_report| This week, ex-President Donald Trump lashed out in response to recently enacted election restrictions in Georgia, where Republican Governor Brian Kemp signed legislation into law that bans outside organizations from providing food and water to voters standing in line at polling places, blocks the usage of mobile polling places, imposes new voter ID requirements for mail-in voting, and more. Trump claimed that the legislation didn’t go far enough in addressing the imaginary fraud problems that he insists plagued the 2020 presidential race.    Trump, quite simply, sounds like he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. For instance, he complained that the legislation “doesn’t have Signature Matching and many other safety measures, which were sadly left out.” He sounds like he’s still convinced that Georgia authorities didn’t even have any meaningful signature check process in place at all for mail-in ballots in the 2020 election, which is just false. Tabulators checked signatures submitted for every single mail-in ballot in the state, and a subsequent audit of 15,000 mail-in ballot signatures in Cobb County revealed no fraud. Trump is peddling galling ignorance combined with a refusal to even try to engage with the truth. The new Georgia legislation “de-emphasizes signatures used in the absentee ballot process and instead requires voters to provide a copy of a Georgia ID,” a Georgia news outlet explains. Meanwhile, the ex-president commented in part as follows: ‘TOO BAD THE DESPERATELY NEEDED ELECTION REFORMS IN GEORGIA DIDN’T GO FURTHER AS THEIR ORIGINALLY APPROVED BILL DID, BUT THE GOVERNOR AND LT. GOVERNOR WOULD NOT GO FOR IT. THE WATERED-DOWN VERSION, THAT WAS JUST PASSED AND APPROVED BY GOVERNOR KEMP, WHILE BETTER THAN BEFORE, DOESN’T HAVE SIGNATURE MATCHING AND MANY OTHER SAFETY MEASURES WHICH WERE SADLY LEFT OUT. THIS BILL SHOULD HAVE BEEN PASSED BEFORE THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, NOT AFTER.’ Read his comments by clicking on the post below: Trump has continued to insist that he was the rightful winner of the 2020 presidential election since leaving the White House. His commitment to his whiny delusion is mind-boggling, really. He complained recently that The New York Times “didn’t talk about… how the CHEATING Democrats circumvented State Legislatures… in Swing States to rig the 2020 Presidential Election, or how Democrats paid for votes in many Urban Centers, in a little thing called “walking around money,”… massive Fake Mail-In Ballots, illegal immigrants and dead people who voted (for Dems), and much more,” but none of these things are reflective of reality! Democrats didn’t, for instance, pay for votes. That just did not happen.
bipartisan_report| Things are looking up for the nation’s airlines, travelers, and American voters. Finally, some good news. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued new guidelines for people who would like to travel after they have had their COVID-19 vaccine(s). Vacation time for our un-young. It will not be long before the nation is on the move again, if people continue getting their vaccinations. Chicago-based United Airlines just became the fourth of the top airlines to criticize the Republican legislators’ new election moves on Monday. Its statement read, according to The Newsweek magazine: ‘OUR MISSION IS TO CONNECT PEOPLE AND UNITE THE WORLD. WE BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO DO THIS IS TO ENGAGE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, WHICH BEGINS WITH VOTING—A VITAL CIVIC DUTY. AMERICA’S DEMOCRACY IS STRONGER WHEN WE’RE ALL ENGAGED, AND EVERY VOTE IS PROPERLY COUNTED.’ The airline’s tweeted message continued: ‘SOME HAVE QUESTIONED THE INTEGRITY OF THE NATION’S ELECTION SYSTEM AND ARE USING IT TO JUSTIFY STRICTER VOTING PROCEDURES, EVEN THOUGH NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE FOUND ZERO CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF WIDESPREAD FRAUD IN U.S. ELECTIONS. LEGISLATION THAT INFRINGES ON THE RIGHT TO VOTE OF FELLOW AMERICANS IS WRONG,” THE STATEMENT READS. “WE BELIEVE THAT LEADERS IN BOTH PARTIES SHOULD WORK TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS BY MAKING IT EASIER AND MORE CONVENIENT FOR THEM TO CAST A BALLOT AND HAVE IT COUNTED.’  The Texas Senate has already been nudging a bill forward: ‘[TO] LIMIT EARLY VOTING HOURS, PROHIBIT DRIVE-THROUGH VOTING, AND BAN LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS FROM PROACTIVELY SENDING ABSENTEE BALLOTS TO ELIGIBLE VOTERS.’ Americans Airlines, which is based in another state eyeing Florida’s and Georgia’s new laws, Texas, also released its statement: ‘TO MAKE AMERICAN’S STANCE CLEAR: WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL AND OTHERS LIKE IT. AS A TEXAS-BASED BUSINESS, WE MUST STAND UP FOR THE RIGHTS OF OUR TEAM MEMBERS AND CUSTOMERS WHO CALL TEXAS HOME, AND HONOR THE SACRIFICES MADE BY GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS TO PROTECT AND EXPAND THE RIGHT TO VOTE.’ In a memo to employees, Atlanta-based Delta CEO Ed Bastian blasted the state’s voting law, saying it was “unacceptable and does not match Delta’s values:” ‘AFTER HAVING TIME TO NOW FULLY UNDERSTAND ALL THAT IS IN THE BILL, COUPLED WITH DISCUSSIONS WITH LEADERS AND EMPLOYEES IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY, IT’S EVIDENT THAT THE BILL INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT WILL MAKE IT HARDER FOR MANY UNDERREPRESENTED VOTERS, PARTICULARLY BLACK VOTERS, TO EXERCISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ELECT THEIR REPRESENTATIVES. THAT IS WRONG.’ Another Texas headquartered airline, Southwest, sent an email to The Forbes magazine: ‘THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS FOUNDATIONAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY AND A RIGHT COVETED BY ALL. WE BELIEVE EVERY VOTER SHOULD HAVE A FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO LET THEIR VOICE BE HEARD. THIS RIGHT IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR NATION’S SUCCESS.’ The CDC, the nation’s public health agency announced on Friday: ‘[R]ECENT STUDIES EVALUATING THE REAL-WORLD EFFECTS OF VACCINATION [AND] FULLY VACCINATED PEOPLE CAN TRAVEL AT LOW RISK TO THEMSELVES.’ The agency continued noting that COVID-19 testing prior to or after travel was not any longer necessary unless the destination country required it: ‘[A] PERSON IS CONSIDERED FULLY VACCINATED TWO WEEKS AFTER RECEIVING THE LAST RECOMMENDED DOSE OF VACCINE..COVID-19 TESTING OR POST-TRAVEL SELF-QUARANTINE, BUT [TRAVELERS SHOULD CONTINUE] WEARING A MASK, AVOIDING CROWDS, SOCIALLY DISTANCING, AND WASHING HANDS FREQUENTLY.’ The Motley Fool wrote this about the CDC news: ‘[I[NVESTORS APPEAR TO TAKE THE NEWS AS A “POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT.”‘ Twitter took off after Delta’s tweet.

bipartisan_report| Voting rights lawyer Marc Elias has announced that, on behalf of the League of United Latin American Citizens of Iowa, he has filed a lawsuit challenging suppressive new election restrictions that Iowa Republican Governor Kim Reynolds recently signed into law. The Iowa legislation is serious — among other travesties, it even punitively cuts an hour from Election Day in-person voting, although it’s difficult (to say the least) to imagine how shortening the time in which people can vote could possibly address the imaginary election integrity problems that Republicans have cited.    As summarized by Elias’s team, their new Iowa court case “claims that the bill’s voting restrictions—including shortening the absentee voting period, reducing the number of days a voter can request and return an absentee ballot, shortening the time polls are open on Election Day and more—create an undue burden on the fundamental right to vote in violation of the Iowa Constitution.” Elias, who was involved in a slew of defenses against Trump-aligned court fights over the presidential election outcome, has also filed a lawsuit over recently enacted suppressive legislation in Georgia. In Iowa, the new legislation cuts nine days from the statewide early voting period, which, like the shortened Election Day in-person voting hours, has little to do with cutting down on the supposed election fraud that isn’t even actually present like certain Republicans have claimed. The Iowa legislation also, as Elias noted, cuts the time in which voters can return mail-in ballots and have them counted. Previously, “ballots placed in the mail the day before Election Day could be counted as long as they arrived by noon the following Monday,” the Des Moines Register explains. Now, mail-in ballots must be received by the time that polls close on Election Day to count, no matter postal delays or any other issues. Ex-President Trump has claimed that extended ballot counting periods harbored fraud, but there is no legitimate evidence for this claim. Elsewhere, Republican state legislators have faced substantial pushback over their voter suppression efforts. Major League Baseball recently announced that they’d be moving the All-Star Game out of Georgia in protest of the state’s new voting restrictions. Among other controversial provisions, the bill imposes new voter ID requirements around mail-in voting, although no systematic problems were discovered with the state’s previously employed signature verification system for mail-in ballots. As elsewhere, punitive voter ID requirements could unfairly impact disadvantaged communities.
bipartisan_report| This week, Major League Baseball announced that they were moving the planned All-Star Game out of Georgia in protest of the state’s recent enactment of suppressive new voting restrictions. (The league’s leader noted, though, that their “planned investments to support local communities in Atlanta as part of our All-Star Legacy Projects will move forward.”) The Georgia legislation has attracted steep criticism for the hurdles that it has imposed around the electoral process in the state, and over the weekend, former President Barack Obama issued a public statement in support of the MLB’s decision. As Obama put it: ‘CONGRATULATIONS TO @MLB FOR TAKING A STAND ON BEHALF OF VOTING RIGHTS FOR ALL CITIZENS. THERE’S NO BETTER WAY FOR AMERICA’S PASTIME TO HONOR THE GREAT HANK AARON, WHO ALWAYS LED BY EXAMPLE.’ Georgia Republican leaders absolutely freaked out following the announcement of the MLB’s decision. Governor Brian Kemp, for instance, claimed that “all Americans” ought to “understand” that “cancel culture and woke political activists are coming for every aspect of your life, sports included,” and he characterized the MLB’s decision as an “attack on our state.” Calling a private organization’s decision to move one baseball game an “attack” is unhinged. Somehow, Georgia state House Speaker David Ralston (R) sounded even more off-the-edge — he complained that “Stacey Abrams’ leftist lies have stolen the All-Star Game from Georgia,” insisting that Georgians will “continue to speak truth despite extortion and intimidation.” The Republican persecution complex continues. Despite self-important claims to the contrary from Georgia Republicans, the new election-related legislation in the state is harmful. Among other examples, it imposes new voter ID requirements around the usage of mail-in ballots despite the fact that no systematic problems emerged in the state’s previous signature-based verification system for these ballots. Ex-President Donald Trump did, however, feverishly and deceptively complain about Georgia’s signature verification system, and now state Republicans have come up with this suppressive legislation. It’s an unnecessary, punitive hurdle — as voting rights lawyer Marc Elias explained on Twitter, accidentally submitting the wrong information when using a state driver’s license to fulfill the identification requirement seems dangerously easy. Ballots from mail-in voters could be unfairly rejected because of these totally unnecessary new procedural challenges. Check out Twitter’s response to Obama’s MLB statement below: 
bipartisan_report| Major League Baseball (MLB) chief Robert D. Manfred, Jr. has announced that the league is moving its planned All-Star Game out of Georgia in protest of the state’s new suppressive election legislation. Georgia Republican Governor Brian Kemp just recently signed the bill in question, which contains a slew of new restrictions around the electoral process that are poised to disproportionately negatively impact marginalized communities like Black voters. The state, for instance, has now banned the usage of mobile polling places, which were used during the 2020 election cycle in Fulton County, a highly populated Atlanta-area jurisdiction with a substantial Black population. Explaining that the league has “engaged in thoughtful conversations with Clubs, former and current players, the Players Association, and The Players Alliance, among others, to listen to their views,” Manfred said as follows on Friday: ‘MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL FUNDAMENTALLY SUPPORTS VOTING RIGHTS FOR ALL AMERICANS AND OPPOSES RESTRICTIONS TO THE BALLOT BOX. IN 2020, MLB BECAME THE FIRST PROFESSIONAL SPORTS LEAGUE TO JOIN THE NON-PARTISAN CIVIC ALLIANCE TO HELP BUILD A FUTURE IN WHICH EVERYONE PARTICIPATES IN SHAPING THE UNITED STATES. WE PROUDLY USED OUR PLATFORM TO ENCOURAGE BASEBALL FANS AND COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY TO PERFORM THEIR CIVIC DUTY AND ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE VOTING PROCESS. FAIR ACCESS TO VOTING CONTINUES TO HAVE OUR GAME’S UNWAVERING SUPPORT.’ Manfred added that although the league its moving its planned game out of the state, they will still be moving forward with “investments to support local communities in Atlanta as part of our All-Star Legacy Projects,” as he explained. In other words, prospective positive community impacts associated with the All-Star Game will not be leaving along with the game itself. The league’s move follows similar criticism for the Georgia legislation from other companies like Delta Air Lines, which is based in the state. Some of the legislation’s other particularly controversial components include a ban on outside organizations providing food and water to voters waiting in polling place lines, no matter how long, and new voter ID requirements for the usage of mail-in ballots. As voting rights lawyer Marc Elias explained it on Twitter, mail-in/ absentee voters will now have to submit certain information from their driver’s licenses along with their ballots if using those IDs to fulfill the voter identification requirements, but it seems easy to mistakenly use the wrong number. This new legislation enacts punitive procedural hurdles that clearly could have the effect of making voting more difficult for marginalized Georgia communities.
bipartisan_report|" After Donald Trump ranted and raved for two months that the presidential election he lost by the largest margin in history was stolen from him by Democrats, vote tabulating machine companies, Republicans in red states that went blue, election officials, and everyone else he could think of, far too few chose to speak up and denounce his lies. Georgia’s new voter suppression laws, each based on the lies Trump told that led to an insurrection against the Capitol Building on January 6, some are speaking up. NEW — Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey says the new Georgia voting law is ""unacceptable,” adding ""this legislation is wrong, and needs to be remedied, and we will continue to advocate for it both in private and in now even more clearly in public"" pic.twitter.com/SWNLGswJhS — j.d. durkin (@jiveDurkey) March 31, 2021 Of course, the quick willingness to speak out now comes only after those laws were passed and consumer activism convinced them that silence was not an option. A boycott of Coca-Cola products inspired Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey to give an interview saying that Georgia’s laws are “unacceptable” and that the company will not stand behind them. Other companies, as well as Hollywood actors who work in Georgia while filming, have threatened to take their businesses elsewhere. Coca-Cola’s decision to speak out, however, may be a bit too little, too late for many of their former customers. Groups like The Action Network: have encouraged boycotts, unifying those opposed to Georgia’s attempts to suppress votes. ‘IN THE WAKE OF THE HORRENDOUS VOTER SUPPRESSION LEGISLATION SIGNED INTO LAW BY GEORGIA GOVERNOR BRIAN KEMP, ACTIVISTS IN GEORGIA HAVE CALLED FOR A BOYCOTT OF THE COCA-COLA COMPANY, WHICH IS HEADQUARTERED IN THE STATE.

Read some of their comments below: "
abc|" Civil rights groups on Tuesday said they have sued the state of Georgia over changes to voting laws enacted last week that they said make it harder for all Georgia residents to vote, particularly people of color. In a joint press release Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the Southern Poverty Law Center and law firms in the state said that the law was a direct response to the 2020 presidential election and Senate runoff election, where the state had record voter turnout and Democrats won the state. The groups are suing in federal court on behalf of a church and other community groups. ""The elections were celebrated not just for their turnout, but also for their integrity, with Georgia officials praising them as safe and secure,"" the release said. ""But rather than act to expand participation in the political process, Georgia leaders responded by doing what they have done many times in the state's history: they placed burdensome, unjustified, and unnecessary restrictions on voters, particularly voters of color and other historically disenfranchised communities."" Sophia Lakin, deputy director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, pinned the motives of the law on race. ""This law is driven by blatant racism, represents politics at its very worst, and is clearly illegal,"" Lakin said in the statement. ""We urge the court to act swiftly to strike it down."" Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp defended the law from criticism last week, saying that critics -- including President Joe Biden -- hadn't read the law. ""This bill expands voting access, streamlines vote-counting procedures, and ensures election integrity,"" Kemp said in a tweeted statement. There is nothing 'Jim Crow' about requiring a photo or state-issued ID to vote by absentee ballot -- every Georgia voter must already do so when voting in-person."" Biden called the law an ""atrocity"" when speaking to reporters last week. In a statement Friday, he likened it to ""Jim Crow"" laws and called on Congress to pass a Democratic-supported federal measure to protect voting rights. ""This is Jim Crow in the 21st Century. It must end. We have a moral and Constitutional obligation to act. I once again urge Congress to pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to make it easier for all eligible Americans access the ballot box and prevent attacks on the sacred right to vote,"" he said in the statement. Prominent Georgia voting rights activist and former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams released a statement about the law shortly after it was passed last week. ""Every business, political, and civic leader must stand up and make their opposition to these desperate anti-democratic laws clear,"" Abrams said. ""At a time when Georgia ranks as the worst state for COVID vaccination rates, Georgia Republicans instead are singularly focused on reviving Georgia's dark past of racist voting laws."" ABC News' Quinn Scanlan contributed to this report."
abc|" Hearkening back to the boycotts during the civil rights movement and apartheid, Georgia faith leaders representing over 1,000 Georgia churches have called for a nationwide boycott of Home Depot, accusing the largest company based in the Peach State of standing on the sidelines in the voting rights battle playing out not just in Georgia, but across the country. ""A boycott is not something we wanted to do, but now it is something that we must do,"" Bishop Reginald T. Jackson said in a statement read during a press conference Tuesday. ""They have simply refused to respond, not only to our request to meet, but to their other corporate partners. They believe their silence is appropriate, but not on the issue of voting rights. Blacks and people of color, like others, are also their customers and they benefit from our dollars ... we believe they should oppose any effort to suppress our votes."" Jackson, the movement's leader and head of the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church’s sixth district that includes over 500 AME churches in Georgia, could not attend the event outside a Home Depot in Decatur. But according to his statement, the coalition could add more companies to the boycott call, singling out Chick-fil-A and Arby's, which the coalition plans to contact this week. Jackson was adamant the boycott was led by faith leaders, directly disputing the Republican-espoused idea that President Joe Biden and Fair Fight Action founder Stacey Abrams are behind it. The boycott call came on the same day as the Senate Judiciary Committee took testimony from Abrams and others at a hearing focused, in part, on the nearly 100-page bill Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed into law in late March, overhauling the state's election processes. Since Kemp signed that bill, voting rights activists' pressure campaign to get corporations to publicly oppose restrictive legislation has only ramped up. The MLB decided to move its 2021 All-Star Game and draft out of Atlanta to protest Georgia's new law, a move that will result in an estimated economic impact loss of $100 million, according to Cobb County Travel & Tourism. Faith leaders have backed away from previous calls to boycott Georgia-based companies that didn't speak out against the bill, SB 202, before it was signed into law. Jackson at one point called for boycotts of Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, but has since relented. In his statement Tuesday, Jackson commended those corporations for changing their stances and said the coalition was ""glad to have them as partners in the struggle for a just and enduring democracy."" Rev. Lee May, the lead pastor of Transforming Faith Church, said the coalition is ""fluid in this boycott"" but has four specifics requests of Home Depot: To speak out publicly and specifically against SB 202; to speak out against any other restrictive voting provisions under consideration in other states; to support federal legislation that expands voter access and ""also restricts the ability to suppress the vote;"" and to support any efforts, including investing in litigation, to stop SB 202 and other bills like it. ""Home Depot, we're calling on you. I'm speaking to you right now. ... We're ready to have a conversation with you. You haven't been ready up to now, but our arms are wide open. We are people of faith. People of grace, and we're ready to have this conversation, but we're very clear those four things that we want to see accomplished,"" May said. The Rev. Timothy McDonald III, senior pastor of the First Iconium Baptist Church, warned this was just the beginning. ""It's up to you whether or not, Home Depot, this boycott escalates to phase two, phase three, phase four,"" McDonald said. ""We're not on your property -- today. We're not blocking your driveways -- today. We're not inside your store protesting -- today. This is just phase one."" A Home Depot spokesperson responded to an inquiry from ABC News about the call for a boycott. ""We’ve decided that the most appropriate approach for us to take is to continue to underscore our statement that all elections should be accessible, fair and secure and support broad voter participation, and to continue to work to ensure our associates in Georgia and across the country have the information and resources to vote,"" the spokesperson said. The faith leaders blamed Kemp for the boycott and preempted a claim that it will hurt Georgians, saying it's not a ""job-killing boycott."" But the governor responded swiftly, blasting the boycott and saying he stands with Home Depot and its employees. ""They did not ask to be in this political fight. It's unfair to them and their families, and their livelihoods to be targeted,"" Kemp said. ""Instead of boycotting people in great companies like Home Depot, we should be supporting them, and I know that's what I'm going to do."" Home Depot has 90 facilities, 15 distribution centers and accounts for 30,000 jobs in Georgia, according to Kemp."
abc|" Partisan divides were on full display Tuesday morning as the Senate Judiciary Committee discussed a wave of restrictive voting legislation introduced in statehouses across the country and federal legislation that would standardize voting laws. Republicans across 47 states have introduced 361 voting-related bills in their legislative sessions this year with the premise of restoring confidence in elections -- setting off outrage from Democrats and advocacy groups who are dubbing the trend ""The New Jim Crow."" The title of Tuesday's hearing was ""Jim Crow 2021: The Latest Assault on the Right to Vote."" Debate centered around the voting laws in various stages in state legislatures as well as the Democratic-led ""For the People Act,"" which would put in place federal regulations on running elections, including expanded access to absentee voting and mandates around early voting periods, which states would be required to follow. Republicans pushed back on the idea of federal interference in state-run elections, while Democrats argued the necessity of a federal law in light of conservatives in statehouses across the country, including in Georgia, pursuing changes as to how voters can cast their ballots and who is permitted to vote absentee. California Sen. Alex Padilla pointed to the history of Jim Crow-era tactics that kept minority voters away from the polls. ""Voter suppression is rooted in white supremacy. During the Jim Crow era, we know that racially-targeted, racially-motivated voter suppression was often blatant. Legislatures adopted overtly racist policies like literacy tests and poll taxes in an effort to shape the electorate,"" Padilla, a Democrat, said. ""Today's voter suppression playbook is still rooted in white supremacy and motivated by the same factors as their Jim Crow predecessors but looks different. Overtly racist policies have been replaced by facially neutral ones, like mandated in-person voting requirements, decommissioning of polling sites and manipulated, discriminatory photo ID laws..."" A recent Quinnipiac poll found the nation is split on whether voter fraud or voter suppression is the bigger problem in the country, 43% to 49%, respectively. Fifty-four percent of respondents say they’d like to keep in place the expanded voting access in 2020 due to the coronavirus. But baseless fears of voter fraud -- perpetuated by former President Donald Trump and others -- still exist despite assurances made top Trump administration officials, including former Attorney General Bill Barr, and top Republicans across the country that there were no signs of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. ""I can't help but wonder why, after the Trump administration top elections security official and Georgia's own election officials vouched for the integrity of the last elections, did seemingly every Republican-controlled legislative body in the country... file and move voter suppression bills,"" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said. ""The lie of massive, rampant voter fraud is serving the same function today as it did during the rise of Jim Crow,"" Sherrilyn Ifill, the president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said. ""It stokes fear in a segment of the population that democracy is in peril, and thus provides cover for laws that target Black voters with race-neutral language in the 21st century."" One of the most restrictive elections bills this year has come out of Georgia, a target of Trump’s in the aftermath of the 2020 election. After the state turned blue with the election of President Joe Biden and the flipping of two Senate seats, Republicans pushed and passed SB 202 -- a massive omnibus voting bill that set new guidelines for early, in-person voting and gave the General Assembly greater control over election administration, among other provisions. While some Republicans argue that voters' faith in the system needed to be restored, many Democrats contended Tuesday that Republicans are changing the law in Georgia and other states to solidify wins in subsequent contests -- and that they are targeting Black voters in particular to make that happen. The response to that, they say, is federal legislation. ""If we had not acted in 1965, what would our country look like?"" said Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., who gave testimony at the hearing, referring to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. ""Surely I would not be sitting here, only the 11th Black senator in the history of our country, and the first Black senator in Georgia."" “And maybe that is the point,” he added. Republicans said that the point of new legislation is not to disenfranchise Black people and that federal legislation would usurp state's rights. “Nowhere in the Constitution does it empower the federal government to completely usurp the role of the states in holding elections,” Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said. “Yet through H.R. 1, Congress is not acting as a check, it's acting like a hijacker to take over the constitutional authority from the states, and acting as a sole arbiter in how an election is running in rural Vermont, or downtown Chicago."" Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the committee, called the title of the hearing ""offensive."" ""At a time when voters on both sides of the aisle have doubts about the integrity of our elections, polarizing rhetoric that distorts history is not helpful,” he said. He warned against perpetuating claims of voter suppression, saying that ""basic claims of voter suppression are just as corrosive to our democracy as baseless claims of voter fraud."" Still, the hearing kept returning to the question of whether ""Jim Crow"" is at work in new voter legislation in states across the country. ""Let me concede at the outset that Jim Crow at its worst was more violent than the situation we face today,"" Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said Tuesday. ""But I think the bottom-line question which we are addressing in this hearing is whether there is a design or an intent in legislation that is being considered and passed in many states, including the state of Georgia, to limit or restrict the right to vote of minority populations, with the intent of having an influence on the outcome of the election,"" he added. Former state House Democratic leader and voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams said that, in fact, is the intent of the Georgia law. ""The intent, always matters, sir, and that is the point of this conversation, that is the point of the Jim Crow narrative -- that Jim Crow did not simply look at the activity, it looked at the intent, it looks at the behavior and the targeted behaviors that were disproportionately used by people of color,"" she said."

abc| Six people are dead after an accident caused a van to catch fire on a Georgia highway. The Gwinnett County police and fire departments were dispatched to northbound Interstate 85 where it splits to Interstate 985 on Saturday just after 6:30 p.m. in response to reports of a vehicle that was on its side and engulfed in flames, authorities said. Passersby tried to pull people out of the burning van and render aid, police said. Several lanes of both highways were shut down as a result of the crash. Six people died at the scene, and several others were transported to local hospitals in the Atlanta area, police said. All occupants of the passenger van appear to be adults. One bystander who suffered a minor injury declined transport to the hospital. Another car may have been either directly or indirectly involved in the incident, investigators believe, based on witness statements. Police are still trying to determine what caused the crash. ABC News' Ben Stein contributed to this report.
abc|" President Joe Biden on Friday called a sweeping new Georgia law restricting voting access, passed by the state's Republican-led legislature, an ""atrocity,"" speaking to reporters as left the White House for Delaware. He spoke shortly after issuing a statement on what he called the ""attack on the right to vote in Georgia,"" a state he won in November amid debunked claims of fraud. ""[I]nstead of celebrating the rights of all Georgians to vote or winning campaigns on the merits of their ideas, Republicans in the state instead rushed through an un-American law to deny people the right to vote. This law, like so many others being pursued by Republicans in statehouses across the country is a blatant attack on the Constitution and good conscience,"" Biden said in the statement. He later said the Justice Department was looking into the matter. On Thursday afternoon, Georgia Republicans voted to pass and sign into law a 90-page bill that severely limits voting rights in a previously Republican-dominated state that, besides Biden, also elected two Democratic senators in the 2020 election. Republicans said they were ensuring election integrity. When the bill was sent quickly to GOP Gov. Brian Kemp for his signature, a Democratic state representative from Atlanta, Park Cannon, went to his office, knocked on the governor's closed office door, demanding to be let in. In a scene caught on video, she was arrested by Georgia state troopers, taken from the building, and charged with a felony for obstruction of law enforcement and preventing or disrupting General Assembly sessions, according to the Georgia State Patrol. “I think anyone who saw that video would have been deeply concerned by the actions that were taken by law enforcement to arrest her when she simply, by the video that was provided, seemed to be knocking on the door to see if she could watch a bill being signed into law,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at her Friday briefing. Biden, in his statement, said he would ""take his case to the American people."" ""This is Jim Crow in the 21st Century. It must end. We have a moral and Constitutional obligation to act. I once again urge Congress to pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to make it easier for all eligible Americans access the ballot box and prevent attacks on the sacred right to vote,"" he said in the statement. Earlier Friday, White House communications director Kate Bedingfield told CNN Biden will work to ensure the Senate passes the voting rights bill that could negate Georgia's new law, without being specific whether he would support doing away with the Senate filibuster rule in order to get it done. ""You saw him speak to this yesterday, incredibly forcefully, you know, he said what we see going on here is sick, it's un-American,"" she said. ""So, yes, and he is going to work to push forward and ensure that we are signing this legislation into law."" However, with a very narrow Democratic majority in the Senate, passing the legislation might mean doing away with the filibuster, something Biden has maintained he doesn't want to do, but hinted Thursday that is might be an option to achieving policy goals. ""In terms of the filibuster, his great hope, his preference is we can work together on issues that matter tremendously to the American people,"" Bedingfield said. ""If Republicans refuse to do that, then as he said yesterday, he'll look at different options, but his hope is we can continue to work together."" ""What I'm worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It's sick. It's sick. Deciding in some states that you cannot bring water to people standing in line waiting to vote? Deciding that you're going to end voting at 5:00 when working people are just getting off work? Deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances?"" Biden said at his Thursday news conference. ""It's all designed."" He kept up his criticism in Friday's statement. ""Among the outrageous parts of this new state law, it ends voting hours early so working people can’t cast their vote after their shift is over. It adds rigid restrictions on casting absentee ballots that will effectively deny the right to vote to countless voters. And it makes it a crime to provide water to voters while they wait in line – lines Republican officials themselves have created by reducing the number of polling sites across the state, disproportionately in Black neighborhoods,"" he said. Asked Friday how the voting rights issue affected his thinking on the Senate filibuster, Biden seemed to tamp down expectations. ""You know, you have to have 50 votes. 51 votes. You have to win to be able to move the filibuster, on any change in the filibuster. And right now, that doesn’t exist,"" he told reporters. ""That doesn’t exist. So, you know, look, I -- The only thing I’ve been relatively good at in my long career in the Senate is figuring out when to move and when not to move. You got to have the votes."" Georgia Gov. Kemp shot back at Biden Friday. ""There is nothing ‘Jim Crow’ about requiring a photo or state-issued ID to vote by absentee ballot – every Georgia voter must already do so when voting in-person. President Biden, the left, and the national media are determined to destroy the sanctity and security of the ballot box,"" Kemp said in a statement. ABC News's Quinn Scanlan, Sarah Kolinovsky and Justin Gomez contributed to this report."
abc|" Georgia state Rep. Park Cannon, the Democrat who was arrested for knocking on Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's door as he signed the state's voting bill, says she will ""keep knocking."" ""I ask you, Georgia, to keep knocking,"" Cannon said at a news conference Thursday outside the state capitol in Atlanta. ""America, keep knocking. All of the marginalized people, keep knocking."" On March 25, Cannon repeatedly knocked on Kemp's office door at the statehouse while he gave remarks after signing into law new voting requirements in Georgia following the results of the 2020 election that flipped the traditionally red state to blue. Cannon was put in handcuffs and forcibly removed from the statehouse. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis announced Wednesday that Cannon won't be prosecuted. Willis said, ""While some of Representative Cannon's colleagues and the police officers involved may have found her behavior annoying, such sentiment does not justify a presentment to a grand jury of the allegations in the arrest warrants or any other felony charges."" Cannon on Thursday thanked Willis and the district attorney's office ""for the thorough and complete investigation of the facts... that led to the dismissal of the felony charges that I faced."" ""The joy that I feel for the dismissal of the charges I face is tempered by the fact that I should have never been arrested,"" she said. Cannon said she knocked that day so Kemp would see the disappointment on her face. ""I knocked on the door where my colleagues had gathered,"" she said. ""I wanted to be in the room."" ""I was not disruptive. I was persistent,"" she said. Cannon said Thursday, by signing the law, ""Brian Kemp began to dismantle everything Black people in America have achieved, earned and worked for since arriving to the Savannah port."" ""We should not sit quietly while white men behind closed doors work to preserve their white power and white privilege,"" she said, calling the law ""one of the most racist pieces of legislation in my lifetime."" Democrats say the sweeping overhaul of Georgia's election code will make it harder for minorities to vote and imposes unnecessary restrictions, including preventing anyone but poll workers to give food and water to voters waiting in line. Long lines are especially common in the Atlanta metro area. President Joe Biden echoed voting rights advocates, calling the bill ""Jim Crow in the 21st century."" But Republicans have claimed it expands voter access in the state, for example, by adding a second mandatory Saturday of early voting for primary and general elections. Republicans said the bill was necessary, in part, because of diminished trust in Georgia's elections. Kemp has said the law will make it ""easy to vote and hard to cheat."" But there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in Georgia's November or January elections. Cannon also said she wants to make sure residents understand the new voting rules. ""Until we have changed the new law, we must understand the new law,"" she said. ABC News' Quinn Scanlan and Julia Jacobo contributed to this report."
abc| There were over 140 reports of severe weather on Saturday across northern Florida, most of Alabama and parts of Georgia. This included five reported tornadoes and a 76 mph wind gust that was reported at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The reports also included up to tennis ball-sized hail. On Sunday morning, the severe threat has come to an end and part of that storm system is bringing heavy rain to the Northeast early this morning. Heavy rain will continue to impact the Northeast through the morning hours and some pockets of flooding could develop. However, the rain is expected to come to an end by mid-day and no further severe weather is expected in South and East today. Attention now turns to the Western U.S. where a few different frontal systems are bringing some unsettled weather in the next few days. Mountain snow is expected across the higher elevations from California to Colorado and the spring mountain snow is definitely welcome across the region as much of the western U.S. is dealing with some level of drought. When some of this unsettled weather moves into the Central U.S. on Tuesday, the next round of severe storms will begin. Severe storms, including the risk for tornadoes, damaging winds, and hail will develop from Texas to Kansas. As we get towards the end of April and into May, climatologically, the number of severe threats are expected to increase. In addition, frontal systems moving through the Western U.S. over the next few days will stir up some gusty dry winds across much of the southwest U.S. Fire Weather Alerts have been issued from Nevada to Nebraska and wind gusts could reach 50 mph as humidity could be as low as 8%. Temperatures will remain a few degrees above average across this region and then some of this heat will move into the Central and Eastern U.S. this week. By the middle of the week, the warmest air so far this year is expected in parts of the Northeast with temperatures in the mid 80’s expected in New York City and Philadelphia.
abc|" Following the arrest of Rep. Park Cannon D-Ga., for knocking on the door while Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed a sweeping election bill this week, her attorney said Cannon is ""shaken but resolved"" to continue the fight for voting rights in Georgia -- and to clear her name. Cannon faces charges of obstructing law enforcement and disrupting a general assembly session after she repeatedly knocked on the door of Kemp's office as he held a private livestream of the bill signing. The 90-page bill adds new voting requirements for Georgia residents following the results of the 2020 election that flipped the traditionally red state to blue. A viral video of Cannon, who is a Black woman, being forcibly escorted out of the statehouse by Georgia state troopers, even after she identified herself as a state representative, sparked national outrage. She argued that the public and other members of the General Assembly should be allowed to witness the event. ""It reminds us of the 50s and the 60s in Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia and South Carolina,"" Cannon's attorney, Gerald Griggs, said. ""But I think the governor needs to understand that we are not going to sit back on George Wallace type tactics and not respond the same way we responded to George Wallace. So I think the rest of the country needs to take a very strong look at the tactics that are being used in Georgia. The Justice Department needs to get involved. There needs to be passage of the John Lewis Voting Rights Act to protect voting rights. And we need the Justice Department to crack down on the tactics of these local and state officials that are trying to silence voters and silence people."" Griggs said Cannon was arrested in an area that state lawmakers normally have access to and added she did not expect to be apprehended by law enforcement. ""She has access to all parts of the People's House and so there was no indication that the ceremony should have been closed off. Many times when a governor signs bills that are going to go into law, it's open to the public, to the press and to other members of the House of Representatives and the state Senate,"" Griggs said. Griggs told ABC News that Cannon plans to return to the Georgia State Capitol on Monday to keep working. He also said the state of Georgia should expect a ""prolonged legal fight"" even if charges are dismissed. ""She'll be doing the job that she was elected to do for her district and the people of Georgia. And as far as the charges are concerned, they're just allegations at this point. They have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,"" Griggs said. ""The constitution of the state of Georgia is quite clear on that a duly elected representative cannot be arrested during a session. That's a violation of the Constitution unless there are three exceptions: One would be a felony, two would be a breach of the peace and three would be a treason. We believe, based on the facts and evidence that we have uncovered so far, neither of those exceptions apply,"" he added. Griggs said he and Cannon's team are in touch with the district attorney's office and are hopeful that the charges will be dismissed. He also said Kemp and Cannon have not spoken to each other since the incident -- and that Kemp has not reached out. Griggs wouldn't say if Cannon is owed an apology. President Joe Biden, Stacey Abrams, Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock and other prominent Democrats have expressed support for Cannon, many sharing photos that compare her to civil rights protesters in the 1960s. When asked if that was her intention, Griggs said she's trying to ""make sure that the voices of the voters in her district and around the state of Georgia were amplified."" Kemp has defended the bill and his decision to sign it into law and continued to do so Saturday on Fox News. ""Well, I can truthfully look in the camera and ask my African American friends and other African Americans in Georgia to simply find out what's in the bill versus the blank statement of this is Jim Crow or this is voter suppression, or this is racist -- because it is not,"" Kemp said.

msnbc| When a new election law passed in Georgia formalizing the state’s early voting system, President Joe Biden responded with uncharacteristic vehemence. The law has come under fire from critics as a means of suppressing the vote, particularly in densely populated, mostly Black counties. There is nothing illegitimate about expressing the fear that, for example, reducing the number of drop boxes for absentee ballots and barring pop-up voting places could dissuade some voters from participating in elections. Similarly, there is nothing untoward about proponents of the law observing that Georgia’s drop box provisions, which were first used in the state in 2020 in response to the pandemic, include the egalitarian stipulation that they serve 1 of every 100,000 registered voters, or that pop-up voting places have been used to game down-ballot elections in the past. There are parts of the bill that can be rationally viewed as net positive and negative changes to Georgia's voting laws inside the bill. And we could be having an informed argument about that. But we’re not; instead, we’re arguing over a deception. Specifically, the misinformation being perpetuated about time restrictions on voting hours. “What I’m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is,” the president said March 25 of Georgia’s “sick” restrictions on voting rights. He affirmed that the law would “end voting at five o’clock when working people are just getting off work.” On March 26, the president reiterated that the initiative “ends voting hours early so working people can’t cast their vote after their shift is over.” While the impact of Georgia’s new voting law on future elections is a matter of important discussion, what isn’t debatable is that these specific claims about the time restrictions for voting are outright false. And if America has learned anything, it’s that we must hold our leaders to account for the information they share with the masses. Thanks to former President Donald Trump, we all know the power a lie about American electoral institutions can have. Just months ago, we got a taste of how such a lie can radicalize and lead people to commit acts of astonishing violence. In that terrible moment, Americans of good conscience resolved to never allow such an odious fiction to undermine the public’s faith in governance again. That resolve seems to have lasted all of three and a half months, with the test coming sooner than many imagined it would: Did we really mean it when we said no more disinformation, or did that only apply to disinformation that we didn’t like? After Georgia’s voting law was passed, Glenn Kessler, editor of The Washington Post’s Fact Checker, ran a comprehensive dissection of the bill that disproves the false claims about timing. The law does not cut off voting on Election Day at 5 p.m. but merely codifies “normal business hours” as 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The new law allows counties the option to extend voting from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and it expands the number of mandatory days in which counties must offer early voting while giving counties the option of allowing early voting on Sundays. But that did not seem to matter. Biden had called the bill “Jim Crow in the 21st Century.” Again, the law provides for more days of early voting options than even supposedly forward-thinking states like New York, which does not allow for the kind of no-excuse absentee voting Georgia now allows. It mandates requests for early absentee balloting two weeks prior to Election Day to ensure that the turnaround time is broad enough so that all cast ballots are counted and fewer arrive after Election Day. The law ensures transparency by requiring local election officials to post the total number of ballots cast in person, via absentee, or provisionally by 10 p.m. on the night of the election. And for populous districts with more than 2,000 voters per polling place and wait times longer than one hour, the bill mandates the hiring of more poll workers. But, for some, all these particulars were beside the point. Media figures lobbied the sports and entertainment industries to divest from the state of Georgia. Multibillion-dollar firms, including Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, condemned the law which, in the words of Delta’s CEO Ed Bastian, “could make it harder for many Georgians, particularly those in our Black and brown communities, to exercise their right to vote.” Local giants like the actor and entertainment mogul Tyler Perry demanded the Justice Department intervene against this “unconstitutional voter suppression law that harkens to the Jim Crow era.” His statements were reprinted without comment by local media institutions like the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Only well after the fact did the publication append a correction, noting that “if you’re in line by 7 p.m., you’re allowed to cast your ballot. Nothing in the new law changes those rules.” Biden might have insisted that restrictions against distributing water to prospective voters are punitive and belies the GOP’s darkest intentions, just as Republicans are free to respond that a prohibition on outside groups distributing anything within 150 feet of a polling place or 25 feet of a standing line is not out of place with other state-level laws, and polling places can make self-service water receptacles available if they so choose. That’s a debate around valid though competing interpretations of a set of mutually understood facts. We are not having that debate, and Biden is very much engaged in ensuring that we do not. In an interview with ESPN on March 31, the president was asked how he would feel if Major League Baseball moved the All-Star Game out of Atlanta to protest the state’s election law. “I would strongly support them doing that,” Biden said, reiterating his belief that the law is “Jim Crow on steroids.” Georgia Democrats — from former House Speaker Stacey Abrams to Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff — objected to this, an American president demanding the economic boycott of the state they represented. But what was the MLB to do? The president of the United States said what he wanted, and baseball capitulated to his demands. When Trump, for example, would call for the petty boycotts of Goodyear Tires, Harley-Davison motorcycles, or Oreo Cookies, no one seriously believed that the threat posed to these companies’ bottom lines would be measurable. By contrast, Biden’s endorsement of a Georgia boycott has produced immediate results. The organizing force behind this self-serving mendacity has a compelling power all its own. Grounded, defensible, qualified arguments don’t have the same galvanizing force as sweeping assertions like the idea that Georgia is resurrecting racial apartheid in pursuit of Republican electoral hegemony. Just as Trump was more inclined to argue the fiction that votes were “deleted” than that Pennsylvania’s arcane mid-2020 election reforms might have confused or dissuaded some voters, the more defensible claim is just not as sexy as the lie. So, the lie endures. We all know how doggedly partisans will cling to a harmful mistruth to justify their persecution complex. Trump’s unfounded claims served as the predicate his voters used to dismiss any election result they disfavored. Likewise, we can’t allow Biden’s supporters to cite his words to invalidate the legitimacy of any election result in Georgia that fails to produce Democratic victories.
msnbc|" A day after Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) signed sweeping new voting restrictions into law, President Joe Biden condemned the attack on voting rights as ""outrageous,"" ""un-American,"" ""Jim Crow in the 21st Century,"" an ""atrocity,"" and ""a blatant attack on the Constitution and good conscience."" One element of the new Georgia law, however, stood out for the president. ""If you want any indication that it has nothing to do with fairness, nothing to do with decency -- they passed a law saying you can't provide water for people standing in line while they're waiting to vote,"" Biden told reporters. ""You don't need anything else to know that this is nothing but punitive design to keep people from voting. You can't provide water for people about to vote? Give me a break."" To be sure, the list of offensive provisions in Georgia's anti-voting law is not short. As we discussed last week, GOP policymakers have made it harder to cast ballots through drop boxes, while simultaneously making it more difficult to cast absentee ballots. But as a simple matter of human decency, the fact that Republicans made it illegal to bring water to voters forced to wait in long lines -- lines that will now be even worse as a result of the GOP's new election laws -- is awfully tough to defend. Even Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), appearing on Fox News yesterday, said this element of the new law ""doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me."" Georgia Republicans created a mess by including this provision amidst their new voting restrictions, and as a political matter, it makes a lot of sense for opponents to focus attention on this since it's the sort of provision that the public at large is likely to find offensive. But in terms of practical and electoral consequences, the Washington Post reported over the weekend on an even more pernicious part of the new Georgia law. Up until last week, the GOP-led state legislature had very little to do with the administration of Georgia elections. The new law dramatically shuffles the deck when it comes to power. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R), who famously did the right thing in the face of unjust (and potentially illegal) pressure, has been largely stripped of his authority over state elections. The state board of elections will be led by a legislature-approved chair, who will lead a panel in which most of the members are chosen by Republican legislators -- the same legislators who sided with Donald Trump during his efforts to overturn his defeat in the state. What's more, while most election-management decisions have been made by county election boards, the new Georgia law ""fixes"" that, too: the newly revamped state board of elections will oversee county boards, complete with the authority to shift power away from local board members. A Vox explainer added, ""The state board, which now will be fully controlled by the Republican legislative majority, is unilaterally empowered to take over (among other things) the process of disqualifying ballots across the state. Given that Georgia Republicans have helped promote false allegations of voter fraud, it's easy to see why handing them so much power over local election authorities is so worrying."" Lauren Groh-Wargo, executive director of Atlanta-based Fair Fight Action, the voting rights group founded by Stacey Abrams, told reporters last week, ""It will make what we all lived through in 2020 child's play. Donald Trump won't have to strong-arm our election administrators. The most radical fringes of the Republican Party sitting in the state legislature will be able to wipe out boards of elections."" As Republicans in other states pursue similar tactics, it hardly seems ridiculous to worry about a scenario in which Americans, as early 2024, see a Democratic presidential ticket legitimately win a state, only to have that state refuse to certify the proper results. And what happens if such a scenario happens? I honestly don't know, but it's a nightmare the country would be wise to try to avoid. Yes, obviously this is more complicated than ""Republicans don't want voters waiting in long lines to get water."" But as needlessly cruel as the so-called ""line warming"" provision of Georgia's new anti-voting law is, the power grab over the administration of elections is considerably more dangerous to the future of the republic."
msnbc| In 2013, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg predicted, with prescient clarity, what is happening right now in Georgia. Ginsburg knew then, when the Supreme Court threw out half of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, that it would be open season for voter suppression in states previously covered under the act. And here we are facing that reality with a sweeping and unquestionably restrictive new voting law passing on a party-line vote in Georgia late last week. It came mere months after President Joe Biden won Georgia’s electoral votes and after Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock won runoff elections for the U.S. Senate in Georgia. Now two big lawsuits are being brought in Georgia, both to challenge that voting law. Both suits were filed in federal court (the first suit was filed by the New Georgia Project and other organizations, and the second suit was filed by the NAACP along with other organizations), and both allege that Georgia’s law violates the remaining portion of the Voting Rights Act, Section 2, which guards against voting laws that discriminate on account of race, color or membership in a language minority group. They also argue that the law amounts to unconstitutional discrimination. To name just a few changes we will see under Georgia’s new law: Voters have less time to apply for and request vote-by-mail ballots; anyone who wants to request a vote-by-mail ballot will face new voter ID requirements; and the state and localities are now prohibited from sending vote-by-mail ballot applications unless they have been requested. The law also limits the number of ballot drop boxes and requires that they be inside early voting sites and only accessible during certain days and times. Another highly publicized aspect of the new law bars people from being able to give food and water to voters within 150 feet of a polling place. The law does expand early voting on weekends, but an earlier version of the law would have restricted such voting. Finally, the law also empowers state officials to take over local election boards. Democrats fear that Republican state officials will use this as an opportunity to intervene in local election boards controlled by Democrats. Biden didn’t mince any words when he called Georgia’s new election law “sick,” “un-American” and “despicable,” concluding that Georgia’s law amounted to “Jim Crow in the 21st Century.” Former Democratic gubernatorial candidate and current voting rights activist Stacey Abrams referred to the laws as “Jim Crow 2.0.” Biden’s point, and the point of many critics of Georgia’s law, is that it was passed not just to maximize Republican voting power, but also to burden and compromise African American voting power. Jim Crow laws are state and local laws that disempowered, disenfranchised and segregated African Americans. Some of the laws that led to the disenfranchisement of countless African Americans were literacy tests and poll taxes. The law that finally helped wipe out these restrictive voting laws was a federal one: the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Yes, the same federal law the Supreme Court partially trashed in 2013. But how can Georgia’s law be justified? The answer is the way these restrictive laws are always justified: on unfounded claims of voter fraud. (Quick spoiler alert: No widespread voter fraud was found in Georgia or elsewhere.) If the only way you think you can win is to make it harder to vote, we have a problem. Since Democrats have been successful under Georgia’s current set of election laws, Republicans appear to believe that the way to ensure they can once again win political campaigns is to change the laws to be more restrictive. The legal outcome of the two cases is still to be determined. But we never should have been here in the first place, and at least two things should have prevented this law from ever passing. First, Georgia's lawmakers never should have passed this law. If politicians want to win elections, they should make the best policy arguments to the voters — not try to suppress votes to pick their voters. Second, we know that politicians will often try to maximize power, and this can trample on voters’ rights. This is the very reason so many people fought so hard for the Voting Rights Act in the first place; the act should have stood as a federal guardrail against these types of restrictions. There are two potential solutions before us. First, courts should put some teeth into what remains of the Voting Rights Act and prevent other states from following in Georgia’s footsteps. Second, Georgia’s new voting law provides all the evidence we need for new federal voting rights protections. There is currently pending legislation, passed by the House, that would do just that. It is time for the Senate to act. In the meantime, the best way to safeguard our democracy is to take part in it. Vote. Vote however you can, even if it means standing in a long line and bringing your own water.

msnbc| When a new election law passed in Georgia formalizing the state’s early voting system, President Joe Biden responded with uncharacteristic vehemence. The law has come under fire from critics as a means of suppressing the vote, particularly in densely populated, mostly Black counties. There is nothing illegitimate about expressing the fear that, for example, reducing the number of drop boxes for absentee ballots and barring pop-up voting places could dissuade some voters from participating in elections. Similarly, there is nothing untoward about proponents of the law observing that Georgia’s drop box provisions, which were first used in the state in 2020 in response to the pandemic, include the egalitarian stipulation that they serve 1 of every 100,000 registered voters, or that pop-up voting places have been used to game down-ballot elections in the past. There are parts of the bill that can be rationally viewed as net positive and negative changes to Georgia's voting laws inside the bill. And we could be having an informed argument about that. But we’re not; instead, we’re arguing over a deception. Specifically, the misinformation being perpetuated about time restrictions on voting hours. “What I’m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is,” the president said March 25 of Georgia’s “sick” restrictions on voting rights. He affirmed that the law would “end voting at five o’clock when working people are just getting off work.” On March 26, the president reiterated that the initiative “ends voting hours early so working people can’t cast their vote after their shift is over.” While the impact of Georgia’s new voting law on future elections is a matter of important discussion, what isn’t debatable is that these specific claims about the time restrictions for voting are outright false. And if America has learned anything, it’s that we must hold our leaders to account for the information they share with the masses. Thanks to former President Donald Trump, we all know the power a lie about American electoral institutions can have. Just months ago, we got a taste of how such a lie can radicalize and lead people to commit acts of astonishing violence. In that terrible moment, Americans of good conscience resolved to never allow such an odious fiction to undermine the public’s faith in governance again. That resolve seems to have lasted all of three and a half months, with the test coming sooner than many imagined it would: Did we really mean it when we said no more disinformation, or did that only apply to disinformation that we didn’t like? After Georgia’s voting law was passed, Glenn Kessler, editor of The Washington Post’s Fact Checker, ran a comprehensive dissection of the bill that disproves the false claims about timing. The law does not cut off voting on Election Day at 5 p.m. but merely codifies “normal business hours” as 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The new law allows counties the option to extend voting from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and it expands the number of mandatory days in which counties must offer early voting while giving counties the option of allowing early voting on Sundays. But that did not seem to matter. Biden had called the bill “Jim Crow in the 21st Century.” Again, the law provides for more days of early voting options than even supposedly forward-thinking states like New York, which does not allow for the kind of no-excuse absentee voting Georgia now allows. It mandates requests for early absentee balloting two weeks prior to Election Day to ensure that the turnaround time is broad enough so that all cast ballots are counted and fewer arrive after Election Day. The law ensures transparency by requiring local election officials to post the total number of ballots cast in person, via absentee, or provisionally by 10 p.m. on the night of the election. And for populous districts with more than 2,000 voters per polling place and wait times longer than one hour, the bill mandates the hiring of more poll workers. But, for some, all these particulars were beside the point. Media figures lobbied the sports and entertainment industries to divest from the state of Georgia. Multibillion-dollar firms, including Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, condemned the law which, in the words of Delta’s CEO Ed Bastian, “could make it harder for many Georgians, particularly those in our Black and brown communities, to exercise their right to vote.” Local giants like the actor and entertainment mogul Tyler Perry demanded the Justice Department intervene against this “unconstitutional voter suppression law that harkens to the Jim Crow era.” His statements were reprinted without comment by local media institutions like the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Only well after the fact did the publication append a correction, noting that “if you’re in line by 7 p.m., you’re allowed to cast your ballot. Nothing in the new law changes those rules.” Biden might have insisted that restrictions against distributing water to prospective voters are punitive and belies the GOP’s darkest intentions, just as Republicans are free to respond that a prohibition on outside groups distributing anything within 150 feet of a polling place or 25 feet of a standing line is not out of place with other state-level laws, and polling places can make self-service water receptacles available if they so choose. That’s a debate around valid though competing interpretations of a set of mutually understood facts. We are not having that debate, and Biden is very much engaged in ensuring that we do not. In an interview with ESPN on March 31, the president was asked how he would feel if Major League Baseball moved the All-Star Game out of Atlanta to protest the state’s election law. “I would strongly support them doing that,” Biden said, reiterating his belief that the law is “Jim Crow on steroids.” Georgia Democrats — from former House Speaker Stacey Abrams to Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff — objected to this, an American president demanding the economic boycott of the state they represented. But what was the MLB to do? The president of the United States said what he wanted, and baseball capitulated to his demands. When Trump, for example, would call for the petty boycotts of Goodyear Tires, Harley-Davison motorcycles, or Oreo Cookies, no one seriously believed that the threat posed to these companies’ bottom lines would be measurable. By contrast, Biden’s endorsement of a Georgia boycott has produced immediate results. The organizing force behind this self-serving mendacity has a compelling power all its own. Grounded, defensible, qualified arguments don’t have the same galvanizing force as sweeping assertions like the idea that Georgia is resurrecting racial apartheid in pursuit of Republican electoral hegemony. Just as Trump was more inclined to argue the fiction that votes were “deleted” than that Pennsylvania’s arcane mid-2020 election reforms might have confused or dissuaded some voters, the more defensible claim is just not as sexy as the lie. So, the lie endures. We all know how doggedly partisans will cling to a harmful mistruth to justify their persecution complex. Trump’s unfounded claims served as the predicate his voters used to dismiss any election result they disfavored. Likewise, we can’t allow Biden’s supporters to cite his words to invalidate the legitimacy of any election result in Georgia that fails to produce Democratic victories.

Georgia Republicans created a mess by including this provision amidst their new voting restrictions, and as a political matter, it makes a lot of sense for opponents to focus attention on this since it's the sort of provision that the public at large is likely to find offensive. But in terms of practical and electoral consequences, the Washington Post reported over the weekend on an even more pernicious part of the new Georgia law. Up until last week, the GOP-led state legislature had very little to do with the administration of Georgia elections. The new law dramatically shuffles the deck when it comes to power. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R), who famously did the right thing in the face of unjust (and potentially illegal) pressure, has been largely stripped of his authority over state elections. The state board of elections will be led by a legislature-approved chair, who will lead a panel in which most of the members are chosen by Republican legislators -- the same legislators who sided with Donald Trump during his efforts to overturn his defeat in the state. What's more, while most election-management decisions have been made by county election boards, the new Georgia law ""fixes"" that, too: the newly revamped state board of elections will oversee county boards, complete with the authority to shift power away from local board members. A Vox explainer added, ""The state board, which now will be fully controlled by the Republican legislative majority, is unilaterally empowered to take over (among other things) the process of disqualifying ballots across the state. Given that Georgia Republicans have helped promote false allegations of voter fraud, it's easy to see why handing them so much power over local election authorities is so worrying."" Lauren Groh-Wargo, executive director of Atlanta-based Fair Fight Action, the voting rights group founded by Stacey Abrams, told reporters last week, ""It will make what we all lived through in 2020 child's play. Donald Trump won't have to strong-arm our election administrators. The most radical fringes of the Republican Party sitting in the state legislature will be able to wipe out boards of elections."" As Republicans in other states pursue similar tactics, it hardly seems ridiculous to worry about a scenario in which Americans, as early 2024, see a Democratic presidential ticket legitimately win a state, only to have that state refuse to certify the proper results. And what happens if such a scenario happens? I honestly don't know, but it's a nightmare the country would be wise to try to avoid. Yes, obviously this is more complicated than ""Republicans don't want voters waiting in long lines to get water."" But as needlessly cruel as the so-called ""line warming"" provision of Georgia's new anti-voting law is, the power grab over the administration of elections is considerably more dangerous to the future of the republic."
tpm|" The floodgates have opened. Coca-Cola CEO James Quincy on Wednesday added the company to a growing list of corporations with Georgia ties coming out against the state’s new restrictive voting overhaul law. Shortly after both Delta and Microsoft issued stern condemnations of the battleground state’s new law, the Coca-Cola CEO appeared on CNBC to join the corporate chorus rallying against the law. Asked about his response to more than 70 Black corporate executives who have taken a firm stance against the new Georgia voting law, Quincy said he wanted to be “crystal clear” that he views the Georgia law “unacceptable.” “It is a step backwards and it does not promote principles we have stood for in Georgia around broad access to voting, around voter convenience, about ensuring election integrity,” Quincy said. “This is frankly just a step backwards.” After saying that the company has spent decades in Georgia promoting a more just society, Quincy reiterated that the new law is a step backward for progress. “This legislation is wrong and needs to be remedied,” Quincy said. “We will continue to advocate for it in both private and now even more clearly in public.” Pressed on why the company did not issue its public condemnation of the law sooner, Quincy maintained that the company has long opposed the legislation. “We have a long track record of working in Georgia, with alliances, on our own account with legislators, with stakeholders,” Quincy said. Quincy added that the legislation touches on “an area that’s particularly sensitive for Georgia” and did nothing to resolve it in way that is acceptable for Georgians. “The reality is many things are improved and done and achieved in private without having to take a public stand, but in this case it has not worked, clearly,” Quincy said. “So we’re being more forceful in our public position, even more than we were earlier this week and will continue to advocate for change in Georgia.” A number of Black community and civil rights groups have filed at least three lawsuits challenging several of the law’s provisions. The new Georgia voting law includes restrictions such as new ID requirements for mail voting, limits on dropbox use and banning the distribution of food and most beverages to voters waiting in line.

tpm| While Democrats’ sweeping democracy overhaul HR 1 has run into likely insurmountable obstacles in the Senate, attention has turned to the separate legislative push lawmakers are making to restore the part of the Voting Rights Act that was gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013. A subcommittee for the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing Thursday to discuss the need for that provision to — which determined which states were required to get federal approval for changes to their election practices — to be revived. Restoring the VRA has long been on Democrats’ agenda, but the current wave of restrictive voting measures, propelled by President Trump’s lies about fraud in the 2020 election, has added new urgency to that effort. “Congress cannot continue to let these challenges to the VRA go unanswered,” Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, making an appearance to make an opening statement at the subcommittee hearing, said Thursday. The hearing comes as some members of the Congressional Black Caucus have suggested, according to a Politico report Thursday, that the VRA restoration legislation — known as the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act or HR 4 — should take more of a short-term priority over HR 1, which also includes ethics and campaign finance reforms in addition to its national mandates for ballot access. “I certainly think our focus ought to be on [the Lewis bill] and voting rights,” Rep. Anthony Brown (D-MD) told Politico. HR 4 has proceeded on a slower track than HR 1 in part because lawmakers want to create a congressional record that will make Voting Rights Advancement Act more resistant to legal challenges like the one that gutted the VRA in 2013. Thursday’s hearing was part of that effort. The subcommittee’s majority hosted several witnesses to testify about the suppressive voting measures statehouses have passed since the 2013 Supreme Court decision, known as Shelby County. The Voting Rights Advancement Act is named after the late Georgia representative who, as a young civil rights activist, was famously beaten while participating in 1965 Selma, Alabama march that jumpstarted in the passage of the Voting Rights Act.  Lewis first introduced VRA restoration legislation after previously covered states rushed to pass restrictive voting measures immediately after Shelby County. Versions of it have been reintroduced, but failed to move forward in the House while Republicans held control of the chamber. According to Politico’s report, the legislation’s drafters are still making tweaks to the version they want to advance now that Democrats have full control of Congress. But some members of CBC are growing antsy, particularly with a redistricting process that, in most states, will start in earnest in late summer. This coming redistricting cycle will be the first one since Shelby County, meaning several states will, for the first time in decades, be able to draw their maps without the federal government confirming that those maps don’t illegally dilute the electoral power of minorities. There is also a belief among some that HR 4 stands to get at least a few Republican votes in its favor, particularly from the Republicans who supported the 2006 VRA authorization. Republicans have remained united in their opposition to HR 1 and it does not even have the support of all 50 Democrats in the Senate, let alone the buy-in from them that would prompt Democratic centrists to blow up the filibuster to pass it. HR 1, which has already passed the House, will get a Senate mark-up next month. The exact timeline for passing the HR 4 out of the House and getting it over to the Senate remains unclear.
tpm| Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) has displayed a similar strategy recently as he cross-examines witnesses before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the racist effect of restrictive voting laws.  In a “gotcha” type setup, he tries to lure the witness — last week top Justice Department nominee Kristen Clarke, this week Stacey Abrams — into saying that restrictive voting laws hurt Black people. Then he whips out a statistic to try to prove them wrong.  At last week’s hearing with Clarke, Cornyn attempted to push her into saying that voters of color were suppressed in 2020 before touting his state’s high voting numbers.  He tried a similar gambit during a contentious exchange with Abrams on Tuesday.  Is the Georgia voter law “a racist piece of legislation?” he asked.  “There are components of it that are indeed racist, because they use racial animus as a means of targeting the behavior of certain voters to limit their participation in elections,” she responded.  He pressed further, asking if all states without no-excuse absentee voting are racist. As Abrams responded, Cornyn snapped that she was “filibustering.” He tried to push her into saying that all voter ID requirements are racist — a mischaracterization of Abrams’ position that she had contradicted multiple times during the hearing alone. She pushed back against Cornyn, saying that her opposition lies with restrictive voter ID requirements like those the Georgia law imposes on absentee voters that threaten to push people out of the voter pool. “So sometimes it’s racist, sometimes it’s not racist?” Cornyn asked incredulously.  “Intent always matters, sir,” Abrams responded. “That’s the point of this conversation.”  Cornyn then got around to his gotcha, saying that majorities of Black and all voters support voter ID requirements.  “I’m among those who support voter ID!” Abrams exclaimed.  Cornyn then cut her off and tried to move on to a different witness.  From the first moments of ranking member Chuck Grassley’s (R-IA) comments on Tuesday, it became clear that there would be very little common ground between Democrats and Republicans during the combative hearing. While Democrats have been pounding the alarm on restrictive voting laws from state legislatures nationwide, Republicans have claimed that the laws are not actually restrictive, homing in on innocuous parts of the laws and high turnout levels in 2020 as proof. Most of the laws are coming from GOP-led state legislatures, with many lawmakers using decreased trust levels in elections — a direct ramification of former President Donald Trump’s election fraud lie — as an excuse.
tpm| Over the weekend, a spate of county Republican parties in Georgia showed their devotion to former President Donald Trump by punishing officials deemed insufficiently loyal to him.  Republican delegates in a handful of counties passed resolutions condemning Governor Brian Kemp (R) for not doing enough to help Trump overturn the 2020 election, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.  Kemp has vociferously defended his state’s recently passed restrictive voter laws, a seeming attempt to make up ground with his right-wing constituents ahead of the 2022 gubernatorial election — a potential rematch with voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams. Kemp will also face Democrat-turned-Trump-supporter Vernon Jones in the Republican primary, a devoted disciple of Trump’s election fraud lie. But the parties’ anger rippled out even beyond Kemp, to other stalwart Republicans who hadn’t incurred Trump’s wrath.  After some of the biggest county parties — Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett —elected hardcore pro-Trump officials to leadership roles, Fulton took it a step further and denied delegate spots to such dependable Republicans as former Rep. Karen Handel (R-GA) and Trump’s own former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. They were denied the slots ostensibly because they weren’t at the meeting, per the AJC.  Georgia is not the only state to watch its county parties become Trumpified amid the 2020 fallout.  State parties across the country censured Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, with Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) on the receiving end of significant heat. The Oregon GOP actually released a resolution condemning all 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach the former President, despite the fact that none of them represent Oregon, comparing the lawmakers to Benedict Arnold.  Both the Hawaii and Texas GOPs have also winked at the QAnon conspiracy, which holds that Trump will come roaring back to power, sending his Democratic enemies to jail or their deaths.  The Republican parties in Georgia also went after election officials like Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a common trend in the post-election backlash.  The state GOP in Nevada censured Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske last week for not doing enough to uphold Trump’s lie that the election was stolen.  “My job is to carry out the duties of my office as enacted by the Nevada Legislature, not carry water for the state GOP or put my thumb on the scale of democracy,” she responded in a statement.
tpm| Despite signing Georgia’s GOP-led restrictive voting rights legislation into law, Gov. Brian Kemp’s (R) reputation among fellow Republicans hangs in the balance following his refusal to do then-President Trump’s bidding of overturning the 2020 presidential election results. Republican Party officials in two deeply conservative counties in northern Georgia overwhelmingly voted to censure Kemp, citing complaints that the Georgia governor didn’t challenge Trump’s defeat. Republican officials in Whitfield County, in northwest Georgia, unanimously voted to condemn Kemp because the governor “stood by and did nothing” to overturn the presidential election results. “Governor Kemp’s inaction angered Republican voters, many of whom refused to vote in the January 5th runoff and Kemp helped cost the Republicans two Senate seats,” read the Whitfield County resolution. The Whitfield County resolution also took aim at two other Georgia officials who became punching bags of Trump after they refused to go along with his bogus claims of widespread election fraud. The resolution called on Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s (R) to resign, citing his frequent media appearances that disputed unfounded claims of election fraud by Trump and the Georgia Republican Party. The Whitfield County GOP similarly voted to censure Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan (R) in light of his refusal to peddle Trump’s falsehoods as well as his refusal to preside over the state Senate amid lawmakers considering a bill that would sharply restrict absentee ballot voting. Earlier this month, Duncan argued in an op-ed published in USA Today that the new Georgia voting law was a direct result of the misinformation campaign led by Trump. Murray County, also in northern Georgia, adopted a similar resolution that voted to censure Kemp, Raffensperger and Duncan by a nearly unanimous vote. Although the resolutions simply serve as an official condemnation, Georgia GOP officials told the New York Times that the moves are intended to signal to Kemp and other Republican lawmakers that their terms are on the line because they dared to buck Trump. “I’d vote for Mickey Mouse before I would Kemp,” Tony Abernathy, chairman of the Murray County Republican Party, told the Times. “I know what I’ve got with Mickey Mouse. A RINO (Republican in Name Only) is useless.” Debbie Dooley, who helped distribute drafts of the resolutions and urged Trump supporters to attend the local meetings, told the Times that “Republican grass roots are angry” after Republican lawmakers in Georgia took a stand against Trump’s baseless claims. “These resolutions will let Gov. Kemp, Lt. Gov. Duncan and Secretary of State Raffensperger know we’re going to work against them in the Republican primary next year,” Dooley said, according to the Times. The censure resolutions against the Georgia state leaders come as Senate Republicans try to navigate how to move the party forward as Trump continues to air his grievances against those who refused to challenge Joe Biden’s electoral victory, which include deriding Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) as a “dumb son of a bitch” during the RNC’s spring donor retreat last weekend for not opposing the election results. A new Politico report out this week reveals that Senate GOPers want to push Trump and McConnell to come to a truce as part of their effort to win back the majority in the Senate in 2022.
tpm| The House Oversight Committee’s markup session on H.R. 51, the bill aiming to make the District of Colombia a state, on Wednesday veered into a bizarre argument over Georgia Republicans’ new voting restriction law. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) brought up the law while taking aim at Republicans’ main gripe with D.C. statehood: That it would give Democrats more voting power, particularly in the Senate, where D.C.’s overwhelmingly blue voting bloc would all but guarantee the addition of two more Democratic senators. Raskin asserted that the Georgia law, which Republicans pushed after the Peach State swung blue for Joe Biden in the 2020 election, and the GOP’s opposition to D.C. statehood are all part of a broader GOP effort to disenfranchise voters in order to stay in power. Civil rights advocates have slammed the law and have labeled refusals to grant D.C. statehood — which has a Black plurality — as forms of voter suppression against Black Americans, though Raskin did not make this point in his remarks. Rep. Jody Hice (R-GA), a Trump loyalist who’s also running for Georgia secretary of state in a virtually unheard of career move for a sitting U.S. congressman, defended his state’s law by insisting, without prompting, that it wasn’t racist. “I would just like to say there is nothing racist about the bill that was just passed in Georgia,” Hice declared. Raskin pointed out that he hadn’t said anything about race. “That’s on your mind, not my mind,” the Democrat retorted. “I didn’t raise that at all.” He highlighted the law’s widely criticized ban on giving food and water to people waiting in long lines at polling sites, also known as “line-warming.” Hice argued that people don’t vote “with the expectation that they’re going to get snacks and water.” The GOP lawmaker also claimed it was a “lie” that voters couldn’t be given water, saying that poll workers were allowed to do so. Raskin pointed out that poll workers generally don’t have time to hand out water bottles, and asked why someone like his brother wouldn’t be allowed to give him water if he were stuck in line for hours on end. “Why can’t you bring a bottle of water with you when you go and see there’s a six or seven hour line?” the Republican responded. “Alright, I think we see now where the opposition to DC statehood is coming from,” a fed-up Raskin said. “There is an attitude that is growing in the country which is that if you don’t like what someone else stands for, you nullify their right to vote.” H.R. 51, which was introduced by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), will be put to a full vote on the House floor next week. The bill is expected to pass the chamber, as it did in the previous Congress. However, it faces a major hurdle in the Senate due to the filibuster, which requires 10 Republicans to join all 50 Democrats in order to pass most bills.

fox_news|" Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp tells 'The Ingraham Angle' Colorado has more restrictive voting laws than Georgia Major League Baseball announced that they are moving the 2021 All-Star Game out of Georgia in protest of the state's new voting laws — and it now it is reportedly headed to Colorado, which has some rules that are similar, if not more restrictive.

The Washington Post, however, gave that claim ""four Pinocchios,"" because that section of the law gives counties the option to extend voting hours. Psaki, during the White House press briefing Monday, was asked if the president would change the way he is talking about the Georgia voting law, in the wake of the fact check. GEORGIA VOTING LAW: READ THE FULL TEXT FOR YOURSELF ""Well, fundamentally, the president doesn't believe they should be made harder to vote. He believes it should be easier,"" Psaki said. ""And this bill makes it harder to request and return an absentee ballot."" President Biden speaks to members of the media after arriving on the Ellipse on the National Mall after spending the weekend at Camp David, Monday, April 5, 2021, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) ((AP Photo/Evan Vucci)) Psaki added that ""it collapses the length of Georgia's runoff election, making it harder for large jurisdictions to offer early voting and imposes rigid new restrictions on local officials ability to set polling hours to suit the needs of voters in their county.""  ""Those are all pieces of the bill,"" she said. ""So his view is that we need to make it easier and not harder to vote. And that will continue to be what he advocates for."" CHRISTIE ACCUSES BIDEN OF 'DOING EXACTLY' WHAT HE ACCUSED TRUMP OF: 'LYING TO CAUSE RACIAL DIVISIONS' When pressed again, Psaki replied: ""I think we can — the fact checkers will also tell you — that this bill does not make it easier for people across the state of Georgia to vote. And that's where he has concerns.""  When asked again if Biden can acknowledge that the Georgia law does not change Election Day voting hours, Psaki fired back again.  ""It also doesn't expand them for early voting and makes early voting shorter,"" Psaki said ""So there are a lot of components of the legislation he is concerned about. And that's what he was expressing.""  Psaki maintained that there are components of the law ""that make it more difficult to vote.""  Georgia enacted sweeping election reform last week that required voter ID for absentee voting rather than relying on signature matching for verification, limited ballot drop boxes to one per county or one per 100,000 voters, expanded early voting days, and standardized early voting hours to a minimum of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and a maximum of 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. The legislation barred outside groups from passing out food and water to those in line within 150 feet. The law also handed more election authority to the GOP-controlled state legislature. It states that the General Assembly is to select the chair of the state elections board, rather than the board being chaired by the Georgia secretary of state. It also shortens run-offs from nine weeks to four. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The state election board can also now investigate county election boards and has the power to suspend county election superintendents — though the board can only suspend four at a time. The law was enacted after a Democratic sweep in the Peach State, which Trump lost to President Biden by just over 11,000 votes. Trump alleged mass election fraud in the state, and sparred with GOP Gov. Brain Kemp and Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s handling of elections. Nine weeks after the November election, Republican incumbent Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler lost to Democrats John Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. "
fox_news|" 'Outnumbered' panel reacts to MLB pulling the All-Star Game from Georgia over the state's new voting laws. A Georgia lawmaker is proposing that his state align its voting laws with New York and Delaware's more restrictive regulations, an admitted ""political stunt"" designed to rebuke criticism from President Biden, who has lived in Delaware and served as one of its senators, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. In a Facebook post Monday, Republican state Rep. Wes Cantrell wrote that he would be introducing ""The President Joe Biden Jim Crow on Steroids Voting Act"" and ""The Senator Chuck Schumer 'Racist Voter Suppression' Voting Act"" – both referring to phrases the Democratic politicians used to bash Georgia's law. Cantrell's post highlighted how New York and Delaware have stricter limits on the number of early voting days, as well as eligibility for who could cast absentee ballots. ""Since President Biden seems to be very concerned about our laws here in Georgia, this bill will make Georgia's voting laws identical to those of his home state of Delaware,"" said Cantrell. TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT DECLINES TO THROW FIRST PITCH OVER MLB STANCE ON GEORGIA VOTING LAW Neither the White House nor Schumer's office immediately responded to Fox News' requests for comment. Biden had claimed that Georgia's law blocked people from providing voters with food and water while they stood in line. He also accused the Republican-led state of ending voting at 5 p.m., ""when people are just getting off work."" Georgia's law actually standardizes what's considered ""normal business hours"" to mean 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. but still allows counties to extend their voting hours to as early as 7 a.m. and as late as 7 p.m. It also allows poll workers to provide self-service water from an unattended receptacle within 150 feet of the polling place but prohibits people from political organizations from actively distributing food and drink within that distance. As Cantrell noted, The Washington Post gave Biden four Pinocchios for his claim about voting times. ""Congratulations on your 4 Pinocchios from The Washington Post,"" read Cantrell's post. ""And you didn’t just spread misinformation once. You did it again and again. Delaware's voting laws are draconian when compared to Georgia. Until you bring election reform to your home state of Delaware, it's probably best that you sit this one out. To use your favorite phrase, 'C'mon Man!'"" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Georgia's new law provides 17 days of early voting with an additional two Sundays for counties that want them. Meanwhile, Delaware has no early voting days and won't have them until next year. In New York, early voting takes place for nine days, ending the second day before an election. And while Georgia is allowing voters to cast absentee ballots without excuses, both New York and Delaware have specific criteria for who can participate, according to Ballotpedia."

DeSantis said on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that the ""60Minutes"" segment was ""deceptively edited"" to portray his state's vaccination plan for older adults to be nothing more than paying back the Publix supermarket chain for being a corporate political donor.

Democrats silent after Border Patrol nabs suspected terrorists at border
Democrats who downplayed the possibility of individuals on the FBI's Terrorism Watch List coming across the border illegally have been silent about Border Patrol agents capturing suspected terrorists at the U.S.-Mexico border. On Monday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced that Border Patrol agents had apprehended a Yemeni man at the southern border whose name was on the FBI's Terrorism Watch List. It was the second Border Patrol arrest of a Yemini national with their name on the Terrorism Watch List in two months. But neither U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., nor U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, would respond to Fox News about whether they regretted having downplayed the potential threat of terror suspects entering the U.S. via the southern border. Both Democrats had taken shots at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who warned last month that individuals on the watch list from Middle Eastern countries were taking advantage of the border crisis to enter the U.S. ""When you go out to Monument 3 and you talk to those agents, it’s not just people from Mexico or Honduras or El Salvador, they are now finding people from Yemen, Iran, Turkey,"" McCarthy said.

fox_news|" Newt Gingrich discusses H.R. 1 and calls out corporate hypocrisy and corruptions on America's Newsroom. Georgia's sweeping new voting reforms have drawn a firestorm of criticism from Democrats and even major corporations, with brazen comparisons to ""Jim Crow"" era restrictions that one fact-check called ""incrediby disingenuous."" President Biden, who ran on a platform of unifying the country, called the new Republican law ""Jim Crow on steroids"" and endorsed calls to move the Major League Baseball All-Star game out of Atlanta in 2021. A fact-check in The Dispatch, an online outlet founded in 2019 by anti-Trump conservatives, said the emotional ""Jim Crow"" language was misleading. GEORGIA SEN. OSSOFF REJECTS BIDEN'S BASEBALL BOYCOTT OVER NEW VOTING LAW ""[A]ttempts by prominent Democrats—including the president—to tie SB 202 to the Jim Crow era are incredibly disingenuous. For starters, the bill actually expands voting access for most Georgians, mandating precincts hold at least 17 days of early voting—including two Saturdays, with Sundays optional—leading up to the election,"" the Dispatch staff wrote. ""Voting locations during this period must be open for at least eight hours, and can operate between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. Several states (including Biden’s home state of Delaware, which will not implement it until 2022) do not currently allow any in-person early voting, and plenty, like New Jersey, offer far fewer than 17 days."" Actual Jim Crow legislation in the South in the late 1800s through the mid-1900s effectively disenfranchised Black voters, with such racist measures as poll taxes and literacy tests. The new Georgia law, however, leaves in place no-excuse absentee voting, although it shortens the window to apply for ballots to 67 days. Other measures include preventing government agencies from mailing applications unsolicited, using driver's licenses or some other form of photo ID instead of signature-matching to verify their identity in absentee ballot applications, and codifying ballot drop boxes into law -- they were illegal in Georgia pre-pandemic but used in 2020 due to public health measures. BIDEN'S DISPUTED GEORGIA VOTING CLAIMS DEFENDED -- DESPITE FACT CHECK Other measures that have drawn liberal criticism include shortening the election runoff period in the state. Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock swept a pair of closely watched Georgia Senate runoffs on Jan. 5, more than two months after Election Day, swinging U.S. Senate control to Democrats. The Dispatch also clarified an issue that's been a popular talking point on the left about distributing food and water to voters in line. ""One minor provision that’s received outsized attention is a prohibition on outside groups or people distributing money, gifts, food, or drinks to voters within 150 feet of a polling place or 25 feet of voters standing in line to vote. Polling places, however, can make self-service water receptacles available to voters waiting in line,"" the Dispatch wrote. The Washington Post hit Biden with a ""Four Pinocchio"" fact-check for falsely claiming the Georgia law ended voting hours early, but other outlets have been more generous with Biden making brazen statements about the law or made wrong claims of their own. In his interview with ESPN where he supported the All-Star game being moved out of Georgia, he repeated his falsehood about the the law ""keeping working folks and ordinary folks that I grew up with from being able to vote,"" implying it cut off voting at 5 p.m. He was not corrected. GINGRICH: BIDEN LIED ABOUT GEORGIA ELECTION LAW AND HE OWES THE PEOPLE AN APOLOGY MSNBC aired Biden's false remarks on ""Deadline: White House"" Thursday without fact-checking them, and left-wing MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace praised Delta and Coca-Cola's CEOs for their opposition to the legislation after activist pressure. ""The technical term may be leading from behind but hey, we'll take it,"" Wallace said. On the other hand, The Wall Street Journal editorial board condemned the corporate heads for what they called vague denunciations that suggested they hadn't read the bill in its final form. MSNBC isn't the only outlet to allow Biden's ""Jim Crow"" comparison along with his false voting hours claim to go unchecked. CBS reported Biden's remarks without annotation. Left-wing CNN host Don Lemon praised Biden's earlier rhetoric against the Georgia law last week and repeated the ""Jim Crow"" language. ""It is no different than Jim Crow, a poll tax with a different name and a different method,"" Lemon said March 25. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Georgia's largest newspaper, was forced to make a correction in one of its own stories after echoing Biden's claim about limiting voting hours. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, R., has faced criticisms from his left by Stacey Abrams and his right by former President Donald Trump over the results of the past two elections in the state. He has stood by the law as a means of protecting election integrity and challenged corporate CEOs over their opposition. ""It is obvious that neither President Biden nor his handlers have actually read SB 202,"" Kemp said. ""As Governor, I won't back down from keep Georgia elections secure, accessible, and fair."" The legislation was in part a response to fierce Republican criticism of the handling of the 2020 election, where Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate since 1992 to win Georgia. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Although Trump and his allies cried widespread fraud in the general election, no proof of any widespread irregularities was produced that would have reversed Biden's win. Dampened GOP enthusiasm over Trump's claims led in part to Ossoff and Warnock's upset wins over former Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler."
fox_news|" Georgia Governor Brian Kemp on facing progressive backlash over election reform and lifting remaining coronavirus restrictions. In their blatant assault on local election systems across the country, Democrats and the mainstream media are spreading lies and misinformation about Georgia’s Election Integrity Act that I recently signed into law.   Instead of addressing specific proposals in SB 202, they have resorted to demonizing Georgians – and Americans – who support commonsense election reform measures.  Democrats and partisan activists across the country, including President Biden, have falsely labeled Georgia’s new voting law as ""Jim Crow 2.0."" LIZ PEEK: BIDEN HAS NO MANDATE – HERE'S WHY HE WAS REALLY HIRED AND HOW HIS LEFT-WING AGENDA WILL BACKFIRE This rhetoric is disingenuous and completely false. Here is what SB 202 actually does:  As you can see, these reforms have nothing to do with ""voter suppression"" or ""Jim Crow."" The Election Integrity Act makes it easy to vote by expanding access to the polls and harder to cheat by ensuring the security of the ballot box.   For Democrats, the left and their mainstream media cheerleaders, criticism of the Election Integrity Act is not about what SB 202 does to make our elections fairer and more accessible – it is about fundraising off fear and giving them more power.   They believe that if they continue attacking hardworking Georgians who support election integrity by calling them ""racists"" and ""vote suppressors,"" we will be silenced.   They will of course ignore that President Biden’s home state of Delaware does not currently have early voting options for its citizens, while SB 202 guarantees at least 17 days of early voting access with the option of an additional two Sundays.   They will also forget to mention that Georgia – unlike Delaware – continues to have no-excuse absentee balloting and secured ballot drop boxes statewide.   I refuse to back down from this fight because the integrity of our elections is the foundation of who we are as Georgians and Americans. Even the Washington Post recently gave President Biden ""Four Pinochios"" for his totally false claim that SB 202 restricts voting hours. It is abundantly clear that their relentless attacks and disregard for the truth are meant to distract from their own dangerous agenda.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER It should surprise no one that the left will do whatever it takes to achieve their ultimate goal: complete control of our elections in Georgia and across the country.   As a former secretary of state, I am no stranger to the name-calling, frivolous lawsuits and personal threats favored by these partisan activists. For nearly 10 years, I fought to keep Georgia elections secure, accessible and fair. I sued the Obama Justice Department to implement a citizenship check before you register to vote, and I stood up to the media repeatedly by following the law and keeping our voter rolls accurate.   I frankly lost count of the number of times we went to court against a cast of left-wing interest groups to protect our voter ID requirement for voting in Georgia elections.

npr| Georgia's controversial voting law has been the subject of criticism and backlash. It's also shaping the political landscape for statewide elections that are set to take place next year.
npr|" Director Antoine Fuqua and actor Will Smith, who together are producing the upcoming 1860s-set film Emancipation, announced Monday that they are moving the film's production out of Georgia due to the state's newly enacted voting laws. In a statement provided to NPR on Monday morning, Fuqua and Smith said: ""At this moment in time, the Nation is coming to terms with its history and is attempting to eliminate vestiges of institutional racism to achieve true racial justice. We cannot in good conscience provide economic support to a government that enacts regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access. The new Georgia voting laws are reminiscent of voting impediments that were passed at the end of Reconstruction to prevent many Americans from voting. Regrettably, we feel compelled to move our film production work from Georgia to another state."" Emancipation, which was scheduled to begin filming in June, is based on the true story of an enslaved man named Peter (played by Smith), who escaped from a Louisiana plantation and joined the Union Army. It set a film festival-buying record in July when Apple won the worldwide rights for some $120 million during the virtual Cannes market. The new Georgia voting laws, signed by Gov. Brian Kemp last month, include limitations on mail-in voting and add new identification requirements, among other changes. Critics say that these measures disproportionately harm communities of color. Major League Baseball has already pulled its All-Star Game from Atlanta and moved it to Colorado in response. Large Georgia-based companies, including Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, have publicly criticized the new laws as well, calling them ""unacceptable."""
npr|" In January, under pressure from Donald Trump to overturn what he baselessly called a fraudulent election, Brad Raffensperger remained steadfast. The Georgia secretary of state insisted that the 2020 election in the state was fair and secure, and that there had been no evidence of foul play to back up the former president's claims. Now, as he throws his support behind the state's new voting law, Raffensperger apparently sees room for necessary improvement in safeguarding elections. In the face of Democratic and corporate criticism, he joins fellow Republicans, including Gov. Brian Kemp, in defending the measure as an overall boost for election integrity. In an interview this week with NPR's All Things Considered, Raffensperger praised the parts of the law that add new ID requirements for absentee voting, expanded access to early in-person voting, shorter runoff period times and reduced wait times. All four of those changes, he said, ""are positive, solid, measured election reforms."" ""It's really something that is a very broad-based, uniform process and is going to, I think, ensure that we have faster runoffs and making sure we have very objective measures for absentee ballots, for identification of those voters, so that it restores confidence,"" Raffensperger said. The law is drawing backlash from Democrats and voting rights advocates who argue it limits absentee voting and disproportionately harms communities of color. Some of the state's biggest companies, including Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, have criticized the law, while Major League Baseball responded by pulling its All-Star Game from Atlanta. President Biden described the law as ""Jim Crow in the 21st century,"" likening it to the series of tactics once designed to disenfranchise Black people in the South. In the NPR interview, Raffensperger disputed those claims, saying, ""It's extremely unfortunate and distasteful"" that people are casting the law that way. ""If you look at our early voting period, it's expanded now to 17 days mandatory for every county in our state and then optional two days of Sunday voting during the early voting phase,"" he said. Democrats also view the reforms as an unnecessary response to last year's record turnout in which 1.3 million absentee ballots were cast. The election of two Democrats from the state to the U.S. Senate, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, handed their party control of the chamber. Raffensperger sees the new voting law less as hasty post-election retaliation and more as a matter of timing. ""We have [a legislative] session in Georgia that starts the second week in January,"" he said. ""It seems quickly, but ... any bills that you have, including the budget, are done in that 40-day session."" Raffensperger does have one hang-up with the new law. The measure places a number of limits on his office. It removes the secretary of state as chair of Georgia's State Election Board, allowing the Republican-majority board to take over local election offices temporarily. The secretary, too, can no longer send out absentee ballot applications to all voters, which Raffensperger did last summer. He calls the change to remove him as board chairman as ""shortsighted."" ""I'm an elected official, so whatever decisions I make as state election board chairman, I will be held accountable to the voter. Now you have an unelected board, and that unelected board is not really accountable to anyone but the General Assembly,"" he said. ""You'll never be able to hold someone accountable. Everyone's going to be pointing fingers at each other. So, I didn't support that."" Still, he's optimistic about what he sees as a series of overall improvements. ""Also, for the first time in state law, we have now allowed absentee ballot drop boxes,"" he said. ""So that's another good measure."" Drop boxes weren't used in the state until the 2020 election, when they were introduced as an emergency action during the pandemic. But the new law significantly limits the number of ballot drop boxes compared with last year. Democrats say the shrinkage disproportionately affects urban areas. Fulton County, for example — Georgia's most populous county and home to much of Atlanta — will only have eight drop boxes, down from its 38 boxes in November. But Raffensperger contests that, because that number is based on a rule of one box per 100,000 active registered voters in the county, ""Every county is being treated equally the same."" Becky Sullivan and Justine Kenin produced and edited this interview for broadcast."
npr| NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with Republican Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger about the new voting law, what it includes and how it affects his job.
npr| Major League Baseball changed the location of the game from Georgia to Colorado. That's puts a state with a history of expansive voting access in the spotlight, after Georgia passed restrictive laws.
npr|" When Major League Baseball decided to move the All-Star Game to Denver, it was a moment of celebration for many Colorado politicos. MLB had pulled the game from Atlanta in response to criticism of Georgia's new voting law. The choice of Coors Field as the new site was seen by Colorado lawmakers as another validation of Colorado's reputation for having some of the nation's most accessible and secure elections. But the move quickly met a new conservative talking point: The states aren't that different, Republican lawmakers claimed. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said on Fox News that the change ""doesn't make a whole lot of sense,"" arguing that Colorado has equally restrictive laws. He and others pointed out that Georgia offers voters 17 days of in-person early voting, while Colorado has only 15 of those in-person days. ""So hypocritical,"" Kemp said. Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, posted a similar message on Twitter. Why Colorado has fewer in-person voting days There's a major difference between the states, though: Colorado votes by mail. Every registered voter receives a ballot about 15 to 20 days before the election. And instead of waiting in line at a polling station, the vast majority simply drop the ballot in a mailbox or a secure dropbox. According to information from the secretary of state, 99.3% of Colorado primary voters used one of those methods last year. So, while it's true that Colorado has fewer days for in-person voting, it also has far less demand for in-person voting. Voters rarely encounter lines here. And the ultimate result of Colorado's system is relatively high turnout. Georgia's new law moves the state away from Colorado's vote-by-mail approach, pushing more voters to show up in person. For example, under the new law, Georgia elections officials can only mail out absentee applications to voters who individually request it, shutting down one approach to encouraging mail balloting. And voters will have a shorter window to ask for those ballots. (Georgia sent out absentee applications to millions of voters in the 2020 primary, even if they hadn't requested it, to encourage absentee voting during the pandemic.) The Georgia law also bans mobile voting centers, and it strictly limits the use of dropboxes. This is another area where Colorado is moving in the opposite direction. Colorado had one dropbox per 9,400 active registered voters for the last election, with the secretary of state boasting about adding scores of new locations in the past few years. Georgia has now set a cap of one box per 100,000 active registered voters. The metropolitan Atlanta area could see its number of dropboxes drop from 94 to 23, The New York Times reported. And, instead of being outdoors with 24-hour access, as many in Colorado are, the Georgia boxes must be inside government buildings and voting sites. Meanwhile, Georgia's law adds an additional Saturday of early voting, but it limits the hours of those early voting days to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. How the states' ID requirements compare Kemp and others also have said that Colorado requires photo identification to vote, which is false. Colorado does require some form of ID when voters register for the first time and whenever they vote in person. But the state accepts 16 different forms of identification. The options include common identification cards like a driver's license, U.S. passport or government employee ID — but Colorado also accepts Medicare and Medicaid cards, college IDs, utility bills, bank statements and paychecks. Colorado does not require identification for mail voting once a person is registered. Instead, the state mails a ballot to the person's home, and then matches their signature against a database when the ballot is returned. Georgia allows only six forms of ID for in-person voting. And the state requires that voters provide a driver's license number, a copy of a state identification card or a Social Security number each time they vote by mail. Georgia does allow first-time voters to use documents such as utility bills, bank statements and government documents that show the person's name and address as identification if they were not able to prove residency when they first applied to vote. But that option is only available for the person's first time voting in the state. Water and food for voters The Georgia law's limits on providing food and water near polling sites have become another focus for criticism. After the All-Star Game moved, viral tweets claimed that Colorado has the same restrictions, which is false. In Georgia, the new law bans ""any person"" from distributing food or water within 150 feet of a polling place or within 25 feet of a voter standing in line at a polling place. In Colorado, the state says that ""comfort teams"" may provide food and water, as long as they don't promote a political candidate or cause. Colorado voters are also less likely to need sustenance while waiting to vote, since they rarely encounter lines. Georgia lawmakers have argued that poll workers can still set up water stations. They said the law was supposed to prevent campaigns from trying to influence voters with gifts. A version of this story originally appeared on CPR.org."
npr|" Major League Baseball's 2021 All-Star Game will be played in Colorado's Coors Field, the league says, after it canceled plans for Atlanta to host baseball's midseason centerpiece. The change came in response to Georgia's controversial new voting law, which the MLB says is against its values. ""Major League Baseball is grateful to the Rockies, the City of Denver and the State of Colorado for their support of this summer's All-Star Game,"" Baseball Commissioner Robert Manfred Jr. said. Georgia's Republican-led overhaul, which supporters say expands some voters' access to early voting, has been widely criticized as hampering access to absentee voting and disproportionately affecting minority communities. The Rockies were seen as a leading contender to host the game, because the team was already vying to host an upcoming All-Star Game. Those preparations, Manfred said, helped land the game in Denver. Before the change of plans, the Atlanta Braves were eagerly anticipating the All-Star Game as a chance to show off their 4-year-old stadium and also to honor Hank Aaron, the legendary Braves hitter who died in January. But those plans were derailed by the controversy over Georgia's new law, which President Biden labeled ""Jim Crow in the 21st century."" Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp recently denounced the MLB move as a figment of ""cancel culture,"" saying the league was swayed by activists. Georgia's Republican-controlled government enacted sweeping changes to voter requirements and election laws several months after the state's voters chose Biden over former President Donald Trump and sent two Democratic senators to Washington, D.C. The new law bans people from providing water to voters waiting in line, and it will allow state officials to take over local election offices, among other changes. Kemp has defended the law, saying it ""expands access to voting, secures ballot drop boxes around the clock in every county, expands weekend voting, protects no-excuse absentee voting. It levels the playing field on voter I.D. requirements as well as streamlining election procedures."" Republicans pushed the changes through despite officials' repeated affirmations that Georgia's recent elections were free of fraud, rebuking theories that Trump's allies embraced. Some Republicans are now criticizing the MLB's relocation of the All-Star Game – including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who on Monday canceled plans to throw out the first pitch for a Texas Rangers game. ""It is shameful that America's pastime is not only being influenced by partisan political politics, but also perpetuating false political narratives,"" Abbott said in a letter to the Rangers organization. When the MLB took the summertime game away from Atlanta, Manfred, the baseball commissioner, called it ""the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport,"" adding that the league ""fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box."" In response to the MLB move, the Braves said, ""This was neither our decision, nor our recommendation and we are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city."" The team said it values equal voting opportunities. ""Our city has always been known as a uniter in divided times and we will miss the opportunity to address issues that are important to our community,"" it said. Critics of the Georgia law include executives at some of the state's best-known companies, such as the Coca-Cola Co. and Delta Air Lines. But other big companies with Georgia headquarters have remained silent, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Manfred said the MLB still plans to commemorate Aaron at the July game in Denver. The league will also move ahead with plans to invest in communities in Atlanta, the commissioner said. The 2022 All-Star Game will be hosted by the Los Angeles Dodgers, which had been poised to host the game last year before the COVID-19 pandemic derailed those plans."

axios|" Several civil rights groups filed a lawsuit against Georgia election officials challenging Republican-crafted voting restrictions signed into law by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp on Thursday. Why it matters: The lawsuit from New Georgia Project, Black Voters Matter Fund and Rise alleges that the restrictions violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the 14th Amendment by inflicting ""unjustifiable burdens"" that disproportionately affect people of color and young, poor and disabled citizens. But, but, but: Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, one of the defendants in the lawsuit, has repeatedly said his office found no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, despite baseless claims to the contrary by former President Trump. The big picture: Georgia is the first battleground state to enact sweeping new legislation rolling back voting rights in the wake of the 2020 election, which saw record levels of mail-in and early voting due to the pandemic. Dozens of GOP-led state legislatures have proposed similar voting restrictions, infuriating Democrats and voting rights activists. Read the lawsuit.

ny_post| President Joe Biden is so committed to bipartisan cooperation and fact-based governance that he has launched an ignorant and incendiary attack on the new Georgia voting law. Biden says the legislation is “Jim Crow in the 21st century” and an “un-American law to deny people the right to vote.” It is now practically mandatory for Democrats to launch this kind of unhinged broadside. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, accusing Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp of having stolen his 2018 election victory over Democratic activist Stacey Abrams (a poisonous myth), tweeted, “The Republican who is sitting in Stacey Abrams’ chair just signed a despicable voter-suppression bill into law to take Georgia back to Jim Crow.”  Anyone making this charge in good faith either doesn’t understand the hideousness of the Jim Crow regime or the provisions of the Georgia law.  The old Jim Crow was billy clubs and firehoses; the alleged new Jim Crow is asking people to write a driver’s-license number on their absentee-ballot envelopes.  The old Jim Crow was poll taxes; the new Jim Crow is expanding weekend voting.  The old Jim Crow was disenfranchising voters en masse based on their race; the new Jim Crow is limiting ballot drop boxes to places they can’t be tampered with.  It is hard to believe that one real voter is going to be kept from voting by the new rules.  To better ensure the security of absentee ballots, the law requires that voters provide a driver’s-license or state-ID number to apply for a ballot and one of those numbers (or the last four digits of a Social Security number) when returning the ballot.  The law narrows the window for requesting absentee ballots, although it still allows plenty of time. A voter can request a ballot as early as 11 weeks before and as late as 11 days before an election; any later risks the ballot not being delivered in time.   Ballot drop boxes were a pandemic-era innovation in Georgia. The law keeps them, while limiting their location to early-voting sites.   After getting blowback over proposed limits on weekend early voting, when black churches run their “souls-to-the-polls” events, Georgia lawmakers expanded the potential for weekend voting. The law gives the state election board more authority to take over local election operations, but there is no doubt that election officials in Fulton County, where metro Atlanta is located and long lines at the polls are common, have been incompetent.  Perhaps most controversially, it bans people from distributing food or drink to voters standing in line, an effort to keep partisans from trying to sway voters near polling places. But poll workers can provide food and drink for general use.  The deeper point is that in the contemporary United States, with such wide and ready access to the ballot, changes in the rules or process around the edges don’t disenfranchise people.  Georgia considered limiting no-excuse absentee voting to voters age 65 and over. Even this wouldn’t have dissuaded anyone from voting. A study published by the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research found that turnout increased in 2020 just as much in states without no-excuse absentee voting as in states with it.  Strict voter-ID laws have long been denounced as voter suppression. It’s not true. According to a 2019 working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research, “strict ID laws have no significant negative effect on registration or turnout, overall or for any subgroup.” And Democrats issued dire warnings about the effects of the Supreme Court in 2013 ending pre-clearance that required certain jurisdictions, mostly in the South, to get federal approval before making changes in their election laws.  This, too, was wrong. A paper by a PhD candidate in economics at the University of Oregon concludes, “The removal of preclearance requirements did not significantly reduce the relative turnout of eligible black voters.” None of the facts, though, can possibly overcome the attachment that Biden and other Dems have to their emotionally resonant and politically powerful Jim Crow smear.

ny_post| Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer suggested Saturday that New York would be a much better host city for the July 13 All-Star Game after Major League Baseball yanked it out of Atlanta to protest Georgia’s new voting law. “Georgia Republicans should be ashamed” of their work, Schumer tweeted, while New York is “working to make it easier, not harder, to vote.” Problem is, the Empire State still makes it harder to vote than does the state that’s drawing the boycotts. New York offers eight fewer days of early voting and requires a valid excuse to vote absentee. Yes, Georgia will now ask for a valid ID to vote absentee, but lets you out of the requirement if you attest that you don’t have one. New York even has a ban similar to Georgia’s new prohibition on the distribution of food and drink in voting lines that President Joe Biden labeled “Jim Crow in the 21st century”: In both cases, it’s an effort to prevent electioneering. Those “mobile ballot drop-off” vans that Georgia just restricted? New York doesn’t allow them at all. And this doesn’t even consider all the ways New York empowers Democratic Party machines to engineer elections so that insiders routinely make the real decisions on who holds office. But none of the noise over Georgia is really about standards for free and fair elections. Even MLB’s move is just a cowardly effort to pander — otherwise, why did it just sign a deal to vastly expand its presence in China, which has no democratic elections at all? Heck, MLB would be showing what it really stands for if it just moved the All-Star Game to Beijing.
ny_post| Major League Baseball said Friday it is pulling this year’s All-Star Game out of Atlanta — just two days after President Biden urged the boycott in response to a new Georgia election law. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said that the decision to yank the July mid-season classic from Atlanta was made because “MLB fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions at the ballot box.” Biden told ESPN this week he would “strongly support” bunting the widely watched game out of Atlanta and claimed the new state law heralded the return of racist Jim Crow policies, which Republicans strongly deny. Biden said Wednesday, “I think today’s professional athletes are acting incredibly responsibly. I would strongly support them doing that. People look to them. They are leaders.” But Republicans said it was outrageous and pointed out that Biden has been awarded “Four Pinocchios” by the Washington Post, which endorsed his candidacy, for spreading misinformation about the new state law. Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp said that the MLB “caved to fear, political opportunism, and liberal lies” and that “Georgians will not be bullied. We will continue to stand up for secure, accessible, fair elections.” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki found herself on the defensive at her daily press briefing Friday and distanced Biden from the decision, saying he didn’t order MLB to boycott Georgia, but merely said he would like them to. “He didn’t call for businesses to boycott. Businesses have made that decision themselves, of course. He also was not dictating that Major League Baseball move their game out of Georgia, he was conveying that if that was a decision that was made, that he would certainly support that, and that’s true in the context of the remarks he made in that interview,” Psaki said Friday. Psaki snapped at a reporter who asked if there should also be a US boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China, in protest of human rights abuses. “I don’t know if you heard the answer, the question and the answer that happened a few minutes ago where we addressed this and I answered the question [about MLB’s decision]. And I give a little more context, but maybe you weren’t paying attention to that part,” Psaki chided. The Georgia reforms passed by the Republican-held state legislature and signed last week by Kemp impose new rules on absentee voting — including requiring a photo ID and shortening the absentee voting window — in addition to other changes that conservatives say will improve election integrity. The new law allows state officials to take over local elections work in response to alleged mismanagement. Democrats allege that the bill will constrict voting, particularly among poorer and African-American voters, who helped Biden carry the state in November by fewer than 12,000 votes. Democrats also narrowly won a pair of Senate runoff races in January. But Biden has run afoul of fact-checkers for repeatedly misdescribing details of the law, including recently saying “it’s sick” that the law will “end voting at 5 o’clock when working people are just getting off work.” In fact, the bill does not shorten voting hours on Election Day, but allows counties to expand them later than an existing 5 p.m. cutoff on early voting days. It also adds a mandatory new early-voting day — a second Saturday before an election — and allows counties the option of opening for voting on the two Sundays preceding an election. The Atlanta Braves opposed the MLB move in a statement. “The Atlanta Braves are deeply disappointed by the decisions of Major League Baseball to move its’ 2021 All Star Game,” the team said Friday. “This was neither our decisions, nor our recommendation and we are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city. The Braves organization will continue to stress the important of equal voting opportunities and we had hoped our city could use this event as a platform to enhance the discussion. Our city has always been known as a uniter in divided times and we will miss the opportunity to address issues that are important to our community. “Unfortunately, businesses, employees, and fans in Georgia are the victims of this decision. Manfred’s decision comes as a growing number of corporations, including Atlanta-based Delta and Coca-Cola, have spoken out against the legislation that was signed into law last week. Republicans accused those corporations of partisanship, and said it’s revealing that they are not protesting against human rights violators abroad. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said “corporate hypocrites” readily look the other way at the conduct of countries such as China. MLB said it would continue with plans to celebrate the life and accomplishments of Braves legend Hank Aaron, who passed away in January. MLB did not announce a new location for the Mid-Summer Classic, scheduled for July 13.
ny_post| A bill backed by the Georgia GOP that will overhaul election protocols in the state was signed into law Thursday. The legislation includes new restrictions on voting by mail, and increases legislative control over elections in the state. Opponents claim the measure is a needless reaction to former President Trump’s claims that widespread voter fraud in the state lead to his defeat there in the 2020 election. Georgia — a traditionally red state — narrowly voted for President Biden and two Democratic US Senators amid record-breaking turnout in the last election cycle. The new law limits the window in which absentee ballots can be requested, and cuts the number of locations and times ballot drop boxes can be accessed. The measure also gives the Republican-led senate and house more control over election administration, including the option to appoint the chair of the election board and remove and replace county election officials. The new law will also cut the time frame for runoff elections and ban groups from handing out food and water to voters. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp was delivering remarks after signing the bill when he was interrupted by a ten protestors, including two lawmakers, outside of his Atlanta office. Kemp, a Republican, asked an aide “what’s the problem,” before a livestream of the ceremony went dark. State Rep. Erica Thomas, a Democrat, who is black, was arrested after knocking on Kemp’s door during his speech. The measure was filled with “voter suppression tactics,” a top Democrat said. “We are witnessing right now a massive and unabashed assault on voting rights unlike anything we’ve seen since the Jim Crow era, Senate Minority Leader Gloria Butler said.

ny_post| AUGUSTA, Ga. — As soon as Major League Baseball, in protest of Georgia’s controversial restrictive voting law, pulled its All-Star Game out of Atlanta, there were some knee-jerk reactions from people to boycott this week’s Masters and even for the annual event to be taken out of Georgia, along with calls for the PGA Tour to move its annual Tour Championship from Atlanta. The law, signed last month, allows for election legislation to impose new voter identification requirements for absentee ballots and to empower state officials to take over local elections boards and limit the use of ballot drop boxes. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, who made the announcement that the All-Star Game would be relocated from Georgia to Colorado because of the voter law, is an Augusta National member. On Wednesday, in his annual state-of-the-Masters press conference, Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley addressed the topic. “I believe, as does everyone in our organization, that the right to vote is fundamental in our democratic society,’’ Ridley said. “No one should be disadvantaged in exercising that right, and it is critical that all citizens have confidence in the electoral process. This is fundamental to who we are as a people. “We realize that views and opinions on this law differ, and there have been calls for boycotts and other punitive measures. Unfortunately, those actions often impose the greatest burdens on the most vulnerable in our society. And in this case, that includes our friends and neighbors here in Augusta, who are the very focus of the positive difference we are trying to make.’’ Ridley was referring not only to the revenue boost the Masters injects into Augusta annually, but the millions of dollars the club donates to the community. As the Masters practice rounds have proceeded this week, several players, most notably Cameron Champ, the only black player in the 88-player field this week, have addressed the issue. “As you can tell, it really targets certain black communities and makes it harder to vote, which to me is everyone’s right to vote,” Champ said. “For me to see that, it’s very shocking. Obviously with what MLB and what they did in moving the All-Star Game was a big statement. I know there’s a bunch of other organizations and companies that have moved things.” Champ, one of very few PGA Tour players to speak out about controversial topics, recalled an incident at the BMW Championship that disturbed him and revealed how unaware too many of his fellow players are about some of the social injustices taking place. “I remember walking onto the range, and I had [the names] Breonna Taylor and Jacob Blake [written] on my shoes, and I got asked by three different people, ‘Who are they?’ ’’ Champ said. “To me, that proves the point of why I’m [speaking out]. There’s a lot of work that needs to be done, but I think everything is going the right direction. What I can do, what my family can do and my team can do, we’re going to do as much as we can, even though it’s a small portion of the entire golf community.’’ The PGA Tour, earlier in the week, stated it won’t move the season-ending Tour Championship, scheduled for Sept. 2-5, from Atlanta, saying it has a financial commitment to the charities and the local community. “This voter stuff and voter for American citizens is very important,” 2020 PGA Championship winner Collin Morikawa said. “I think that’s the topic we should all be talking about. We shouldn’t be talking about whether we’re here or not. The Masters, the PGA Tour, we do such a good job and we’re trying to help communities out and I think that’s our main focus for the week. “The topic of voter rights and all that, that should be the topic that we talk about, not if we are here playing golf.’’
ny_post| Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock signed an e-mail sent by a liberal advocacy group that included false information about the Peach State’s controversial new voting law, according to reports on Monday. The Washington Post reported on criticism of the law that has been exaggerated or wrong, including the e-mail sent out by the nonprofit 3.14 Action after the law passed on March 25. “Warnock, one of two new Democratic senators representing Georgia, signed an email sent out by the advocacy group 3.14 Action after the law passed, which claimed it ended no-excuse mail voting and restricted early voting on the weekends,” the Post reported. Both of those proposals did not ultimately end up making it into the law. But the e-mail was sent out on March 30, five days after Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed the final bill, according to Fox News. A spokesman for Warnock said the senator had signed off on his statement before the law was passed, when those provisions were still being considered. The law has sparked fierce backlash from Democrats, who argue it restricts voting, particularly among poorer and African American voters. President Biden, for instance, called it “Jim Crow in the 21st century.” He also said he supported the MLB pulling its All-Star game out of Atlanta. At one point, Biden claimed the law limits voting hours, in an apparent reference to a proposal to curtail early-voting hours that was also ultimately not included, according to the Post. When pressed about the misleading statement, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki repeated the error that the law “makes early voting shorter.”  She backed the president, saying, “his view is that we need to make it easier and not harder to vote.”
ny_post| Civil rights groups are calling for major sporting events to be moved from Georgia, after the state’s GOP-led government passed an election reform bill that Democrats say will restrict voting rights. The Masters is set to take place in Augusta next month, and the MLB All-Star game is scheduled for July in Atlanta. But athletes and activists are reportedly now calling for both locations to be reconsidered, in the wake of the controversial bill’s passage. The law imposes new rules on absentee voting — including requiring a photo ID and shortening the remote-voting window. The National Black Justice Coalition is among the groups calling on pro golfers not to tee off in the Peach State unless the “restrictive” law is repealed. “The PGA Tour and Masters Tournament have both made commitments to help diversify golf and address racial inequities in this country – and we expect them to not only speak out against Georgia’s new racist voter suppression law – but to also take action,” the group demanded. Tony Clark, Executive Director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, told the Boston Globe that his union wants to discuss a possible venue change with the league. “Players are very much aware of the Georgia voting bill, which places restrictions on voting that some believe will make it particularly difficult for black voters to reach the polls,” Clark reportedly said. “As it relates to the All-Star Game, we have not had a conversation with the league on that issue. If there is an opportunity to, we would look forward to having that conversation.” Activists have also called for a boycott of Coca-Cola, after the Atlanta-based company pledged to fight racism last summer, but did not speak out against the bill. President Biden called Thursday’s new law “Jim Crow in the 21st century.”
ny_post| The CEO of Georgia-based Delta Air Lines said Wednesday that the state’s new election law overhaul is “unacceptable” and “based on a lie,” after the company faced criticism that it didn’t speak out forcefully enough in opposition to the bill when it was being considered by the state’s Republican leaders. CEO Ed Bastian offered his assessment of the new Georgia law in a memo sent to employees less than a week after Delta officials joined other corporate lobbyists to shape the final version of a sweeping measure that could make it harder for some Georgia citizens to cast ballots. The memo, obtained by The Associated Press, comes amid a smattering of calls for consumer boycotts of Delta and other Georgia-based brands, including Coca-Cola, UPS and Home Depot. The Major League Baseball players union also has raised the possibility of moving the summer All-Star game from the Atlanta Braves home stadium. Delta Air Lines initially issued a statement touting some parts of the law, such as expanded weekend voting, but said “we understand concerns remain over other provisions in the legislation and there continues to be work ahead in this important effort.” But Bastian spoke more forcefully in Wednesday’s memo to employees. “The entire rationale for this bill was based on a lie: that there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 elections. This is simply not true,” Bastian wrote, alluding to former President Donald Trump’s claims that his loss was due to fraud. “Unfortunately, that excuse is being used in states across the nation that are attempting to pass similar legislation to restrict voting rights.” Bastian repeated that Delta “joined other major Atlanta corporations to work closely with elected officials from both parties, to try and remove some of the most egregious measures from the bill. We had some success in eliminating the most suppressive tactics that some had proposed.” But, he emphasized, “I need to make it crystal clear that the final bill is unacceptable and does not match Delta’s values.” The new law was signed last week by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, hours after it cleared the state legislature. It is part of a tide of GOP-sponsored election bills introduced in states across the country after Trump’s false assertions about the 2020 elections. President Biden won Georgia’s 16 electoral votes by about 12,000 votes out of almost 5 million cast, and Democrats won two Jan. 5 Senate runoffs to give the party control of the chamber on Capitol Hill. Georgia officials, including Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, also a Republican, have vouched for the accuracy of the election counts even as they backed some changes that could make it harder for Georgians to cast absentee ballots, a method that more than a fifth of the November electorate used. The Georgia law adds a photo ID requirement for voting absentee by mail, cuts the amount of time people have to request an absentee ballot and limits where drop boxes can be placed and when they can be accessed. It also bans people from handing out food or water to voters waiting in line and allows the Republican-controlled State Election Board to remove and replace county election officials while curtailing the power of the secretary of state as Georgia’s chief elections officer. Republicans in Georgia insist the changes are needed to restore voters’ confidence. Civil rights and voting rights groups have filed multiple federal lawsuits challenging the Georgia law. Activists also have turned their attention to congressional Democrats’ push for sweeping federal action on voting rights. Democrats’ measures in Washington could effectively override many of the changes being enacted in Georgia and considered in dozens of other state legislatures led by Republicans.
ny_post| Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell defended Georgia’s controversial new voting law on Monday, pushing back on President Biden’s characterization of the legislation as modern-day Jim Crow, and warning corporations against feeding into an “Outrage-Industrial Complex.” McConnell (R-Ky.) spoke out in a blistering new statement released as a bitter partisan debate over the facts of the new law — and pushes for others like it — continued to rage. “We are witnessing a coordinated campaign by powerful and wealthy people to mislead and bully the American people,” wrote McConnell, pinning the blame on Biden as commander-in-chief. “The President has claimed repeatedly that state-level debates over voting procedures are worse than Jim Crow or ‘Jim Crow on steroids.’ Nobody actually believes this.” Biden has run afoul of fact-checkers for repeatedly misdescribing details of the law, including recently saying “it’s sick” that the law will “end voting at 5 o’clock when working people are just getting off work.” In fact, the bill does not shorten voting hours on Election Day, but allows counties to expand them later than an existing 5 p.m. cutoff on early voting days. It also adds a mandatory new early-voting day — a second Saturday before an election — and allows counties the option of opening for voting on the two Sundays preceding an election. The Peach State law requires identification for absentee voting and forbids people from giving would-be voters food and beverages as they wait to cast their ballots, among other measures that critics characterize as restrictive to democracy. McConnell voiced doubt, however, that anyone sincerely believes that the law is tantamount to Jim Crow. “Nobody really thinks this current dispute comes anywhere near the horrific racist brutality of segregation,” he wrote. “But there’s an old cynical saying that ‘history is just the set of lies agreed upon.’ And a host of powerful people and institutions apparently think they stand to benefit from parroting this big lie.” Among those entities, McConnell said, are major corporations seeking to score points with left-leaning activists. “It’s jaw-dropping to see powerful American institutions not just permit themselves to be bullied, but join in the bullying themselves,” he wrote. “From election law to environmentalism to radical social agendas to the Second Amendment, parts of the private sector keep dabbling in behaving like a woke parallel government.” Georgia-based companies like Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola have spoken out against the law, while Major League Baseball has announced that it would pull the 2021 All-Star Game from Atlanta. McConnell wrote that corporations wading into politics should expect to face repercussions. “Our private sector must stop taking cues from the Outrage-Industrial Complex. Americans do not need or want big business to amplify disinformation or react to every manufactured controversy with frantic left-wing signaling,” he wrote. “Corporations will invite serious consequences if they become a vehicle for far-left mobs to hijack our country from outside the constitutional order,” continued McConnell, not specifying the nature of those consequences. “Businesses must not use economic blackmail to spread disinformation and push bad ideas that citizens reject at the ballot box.” McConnell noted that a majority of Americans — including many Democrats — want tighter voter ID laws, and noted that large corporations aren’t applying similar pressure on Democrat-led states that have more restrictive voting laws than Georgia. “Wealthy corporations have no problem operating in New York, for example, which has fewer days of early voting than Georgia, requires excuses for absentee ballots, and restricts electioneering via refreshments,” he said, echoing a point made last week by Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. “There is no consistent or factual standard being applied here. It’s just a fake narrative gaining speed by its own momentum.” Repeating another argument made by Kemp, McConnell wrote that the outrage over Georgia’s voting law is designed to provide cover for congressional Democrats’ attempt to pass their own elections reform package at the national level. “This disinformation has a purpose,” he wrote. “Washington Democrats want to pass a sweeping bill that would let them rewrite all 50 states’ election laws and turn the Federal Election Commission into a Democrat-run partisan body. “This power grab is impossible to defend, so the left wants to deflect,” he continued. “Instead of winning the debate, they want to silence debate by bullying citizens and entire states into submission.”
ny_post| A group of about two dozen people gathered near Augusta National Golf Club to protest Georgia’s new voting law, according to a report. The protestors held up signs reading “Let Us Vote” and “Protect Georgia Voting Rights” as the third round of the Masters was underway Saturday. The law, signed by Gov. Brian Kemp last month, has ignited a national debate over voting rights. Proponents say the law protects the sanctity of the democratic process. Opponents say it is designed to disenfranchise minority voters. “This bill is death by a thousand cuts,” said protestor Marla Cureton, reported to be part of a women’s activist group called No Safe Seats. “Anytime you put new restrictions on how you can vote, that’s voter suppression. We should be making it easier to vote. It’s the patriotic thing to do.” The protest comes on the heels of local and national outcry against the law and the state of Georgia. Major League Baseball announced last week it was moving the 2021 All-Star Game from Atlanta to Denver in protest. The nationwide African Methodist Episcopal Church is among the groups that have called for a Masters boycott. The Augusta National protest elicited mixed responses, reflecting the wider national divide. “One man passing by shouted an insult against Gov. Kemp,” the AP reports. “But another yelled at protesters, ‘C’mon, you can vote! Get out of here!’”
cbs|" Activist and former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is going viral for her response to a GOP senator who quizzed her on a voting rights bill that was recently introduced in her home state.  Abrams was testifying in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee about voting rights when Senator John Kennedy, of Louisiana, asked her to why she objects to Georgia's controversial voting rights bill. Kennedy also asked Abrams if she found the bill racist. ""I think there are provisions of it that are racist, yes,"" she said. Kennedy then quizzed Abrams to list all the provisions she objects to. ""It shortens the federal run-off period from nine weeks to four weeks,"" she said. ""It restricts the time a voter can request and return an absentee ballot application."" ""It requires that a voter has a photo identification or some other form of identification that they after willing to surrender in order to participate in an absentee ballot process,"" Abrams continued.  Kennedy then stopped Abrams to ask a question about that ID provision. Abrams said Georgia would become the fourth state to require voters to put their identity at risk while voting.  ""What else?"" Kennedy pressed Abrams. She continued to list provisions, and Kennedy continued to ask: ""What else?"" ""Is that everything?"" he asked.  ""No, it is not,"" Abrams said. ""No, sir.""  She continued to share that the bill would shorten voting time windows and allow counties to limit voting hours, ""which may have an effect on voters who cannot vote during business hours."" When Abrams continued to list more provisions, Kennedy interrupted her again. ""OK. I get the idea,"" he said.  A clip of the exchange went viral on Twitter, with many pointing out how Abrams kept her cool during the questioning. ""If you watch even a couple minutes of this testimony you'll see @staceyabrams do what she does best: Respectfully and seriously make a compelling argument without alienating viewers who don't yet agree with her,"" tweeted former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander, a Democrat and the founder of a voting policy organization. ""Her professionalism never comes at the expense of passion."" ""Senator John Kennedy thought he was pulling a *gotcha* question on Stacey Abrams by asking her to list off all the parts of the Georgia Voter Suppression Bill that are racist, SO SHE DID,"" tweet Jake Lobin, a Georgia Democratic election volunteer. ""I just watched Stacey Abrams go back and forth with Senator Kennedy of Louisiana regarding the new voting law in Georgia being racist,"" tweeted author Jason Overstreet. ""What she just articulated, in defending how it is racist in very specific ways, was breathtakingly impressive."" Georgia's 98-page election law was passed by a GOP-controlled legislature and signed by Republican Governor Brian Kemp at the end of March. While Republicans widely supported the bill, it has sparked a debate over voting rights, with Democrats and voting rights groups outraged by voter ID provisions and changes to mail voting.  Many believe the provisions will make it more difficult for some minorities and poorer voters to cast a ballot, though proponents of the bill and other similar measures introduced after the 2020 elections say they're necessary to combat voter fraud. Allegations of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, however, were deemed unfounded by the Justice Department, then-Attorney General William Barr announced in December. The bill's passage also inspired many major corporations, including Georgia-based Coca-Cola and Delta, to speak out against it. Major League Baseball pulled its All-Star Game out of Georgia CBS News' parent company ViacomCBS also spoke out against the bill as well. "
cbs|" ""Emancipation,"" a thriller about a runaway slave starring actor Will Smith, will move its production out of Georgia because of the state's new voting laws, the movie's director Antoine Fuqua and Smith announced Monday.  A statement released by Fuqua and Smith through Smith's media production company Westbrook Inc. said the new Georgia law is ""reminiscent of voting impediments that were passed at the end of Reconstruction to prevent many Americans from voting."" The decision makes Emancipation, which is financed by Apple Studios, the first major production to leave Georgia and shoot elsewhere after a slew of major corporations spoke out against the legislation. ""At this moment in time, the Nation is coming to terms with its history and is attempting to eliminate vestiges of institutional racism to achieve true racial justice,"" Fuqua and Smith said in a statement. ""We cannot in good conscience provide economic support to a government that enacts regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access.""  ""Regrettably, we feel compelled to move our film production work from Georgia to another state,"" they added.  The movie was scheduled to start shooting in Georgia on June 21. According to Deadline, talks are underway to shoot the film in the Louisiana, where events of the plot take place. Smith will play Peter, a fugitive from slavery who goes on a harrowing journey north of the state, according to Westbrook Inc.  The new law on Georgia's 7.4 million voters contains new restrictions on absentee voting, while at the same time expanding early voting opportunities. It expands early voting access for some Georgia voters, adds an ID requirement for absentee voting, codifies the use of drop boxes with strict rules on how they can be used and sets new rules for state and local election officials.  Some Democrats and voting rights groups were outraged by voter ID provisions and changes to mail voting that they believe will make more difficult for some minorities and poorer voters to cast a ballot.  Within days of its passing in late March, corporations spoke out against the bill and Major League Baseball pulled its All-Star Game out of the state.

cbs|" Washington — The Georgia NAACP and voting rights organizations on Monday filed a lawsuit to block a sweeping new law in Georgia that imposes new restrictions on voting, the latest in a slew of legal battles expected to take aim at the measure. The suit was filed in the federal district court in Atlanta just days after Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed the GOP-backed measure into law. The law is the first to usher in new changes to voting procedures following the 2020 presidential election, which former President Donald Trump claimed without evidence was rigged against him and rife with widespread voter fraud. ""The thinly-veiled attempt to roll back the progress we have made to empower Georgians — to use their voices in the democratic process — creates an arbitrary law that does not improve voter confidence, secure election integrity nor increase access to the ballot box,"" the Reverend James Woodall, state president of Georgia NAACP, said in a statement. The coalition of groups challenging the law argue it is the ""culmination of a concerted effort to suppress the participation of Black voters and other voters of color"" by the Republican-led legislature after demographic changes in Georgia led to statewide Democratic wins, most recently in the state's presidential race and two Senate races, which flipped the balance of power in the upper chamber. ""Unable to stem the tide of these demographic changes or change the voting patterns of voters of color, these officials have resorted to attempting to suppress the vote of Black voters and other voters of color in order to maintain the tenuous hold that the Republican Party has in Georgia,"" the suit alleges. ""In other words, these officials are using racial discrimination as a means of achieving a partisan end."" These effort, the groups argue, violate the Constitution and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting rules that discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. Georgia's elections law requires providing a driver's license or state ID number or photocopy of an ID to vote absentee by mail and limits the time people have to request an absentee ballot. It also restricts the locations of ballot drop boxes and when they can be accessed, and expands early voting on weekends. The new law also bans people from delivering food or drinks to people within 150 feet of a polling site, but allows for self-service water. The measure makes changes to the State Election Board, which the NAACP argues effectively grants the board the power to take over county election boards. While Republicans argue the voting overhaul will restore confidence in the integrity of Georgia's elections, Democrats say it restricts voting access and disproportionately harms Black and Latino voters. On Thursday, President Biden called the election bills spearheaded by Republicans in Georgia and other states in the wake of the November election ""un-American"" and ""sick."" More than 250 bills that would restrict voting access have been introduced in 43 states, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Mr. Biden has urged Congress to pass legislation that would effectively counter the state-level efforts from Republicans to change voting rules and said the Justice Department is ""taking a look"" at the Georgia law. The NAACP lawsuit marks the second legal challenge to Georgia's elections law. On Thursday, a coalition of voting and civil rights groups sued Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and the State Election Board in the Northern District of Georgia. The suit argues the law was ""clearly intended to and will have the effect of making it harder for lawful Georgia voters to participate in the state's elections"" and will ""impose these unjustifiable burdens disproportionately on the state's minority, young, poor and disabled citizens."" Following the general election, Mr. Trump and some Georgia Republicans claimed there was mass voter fraud in the state's election after Mr. Biden became the first Democrat to win Georgia since 1992. Two recounts affirmed Mr. Biden's win and a signature audit found no widespread fraud.  Still, Kemp said Thursday after signing the bill into law that ""significant reforms to our state elections were needed"" following the November election. The law takes another step towards ensuring Georgia's elections ""are secure, accessible and fair,"" he said. Raffensperger has defended Georgia's elections system over the claims of voter fraud mounted by Mr. Trump and rebuffed pressure from the former president to overturn the results of the presidential election. In a statement Friday, Raffensperger, too, defended Georgia's new law and shot back at critics who say the changes amount to voter suppression. ""The cries of 'voter suppression' from those on the left ring as hollow as the continuously debunked claims of 'mass voter fraud' in Georgia's 2020 election,"" he said. ""We don't have systemic voter suppression, and we don't have mass voter fraud. What we have is systemic lies for political gain that have led to a loss of public confidence in our elections."""
cbs|" Major League Baseball is moving the 2021 All-Star Game and 2021 draft out of Atlanta in response to Georgia's controversial new voting law, the league announced Friday.  ""I have decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year's All-Star Game and MLB Draft,"" Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. ""Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box."" Discussions of moving the game surfaced after Georgia recently passed a strict new voting law, which critics say is designed to disenfranchise voters of color. It requires a photo ID in order to vote via absentee ballot, which more than 1.3 million Georgia voters did during the coronavirus pandemic. The new law limited the locations for dropboxes and the time voters have to request an absentee ballot. It also outlaws passing out food and water to voters within 150 feet of a polling place or within 25 feet of any voter standing in line, a particularly controversial provision as there are often longer lines to vote in disproportionately Black precincts. Manfred's decision came two days after President Biden endorsed moving the game out of Atlanta in an interview with ESPN. ""I think today's professional athletes are acting incredibly responsibly. I would strongly support them doing that. People look to them. They're leaders,"" Mr. Biden said. The president has called the new Georgia law ""Jim Crow on steroids."" However, some Georgia Democrats expressed disappointment in the move. The All-Star Game is one of the league's premier events and the city of Atlanta will be losing out on a considerable financial gain. Past cities have seen as much as $60 million in economic boosts, according to data from the Baseball Almanac.  ""Like many Georgians, I am disappointed that MLB is relocating its All-Star game; however, I commend the players, owners and league commissioner for speaking out. I urge others in positions of leadership to do so as well,"" said Stacey Abrams, one of the state's most prominent Democrats and a voting rights activist. Senator Raphael Warnock called the move ""the unfortunate consequence"" of the law's passage. Georgia Republicans, meanwhile, are not backing down. In a press conference on Saturday, Governor Brian Kemp decried ""cancel culture"" as the root of Manfred's decision. ""Secure, accessible elections are worth the threats. They are worth the boycotts as well as the lawsuits. I want to be clear — I will not be backing down from this fight,"" Kemp said. ""What are they going to do if the Braves get in the playoffs? Are they going to move the damn playoff game? Are they going to move it to other states with more restrictions than we have?"" The move was also criticized by former President Trump, who in a statement called on his supporters to ""boycott baseball and all of the woke companies that are interfering with free and fair elections."" The league has not yet announced a new host city but said the decision is in the process of being finalized. The All-Star Game is scheduled to take place on July 13 and will still pay tribute to baseball legend Hank Aaron.  Khristopher J. Brooks contributed reporting. "
cbs|" Georgia's 98-page election law, passed by a GOP-controlled legislature and signed by Republican Governor Brian Kemp at the end of March, has stirred a nationwide debate over voting rights in the wake of the 2020 election.  Democrats and voting rights groups were outraged by voter ID provisions and changes to mail voting that they believe will make more difficult for some minorities and poorer voters to cast a ballot. Within days, major corporations, including Georgia-based Coca-Cola and Delta, along with CBS News' parent company ViacomCBS, spoke out against the bill, and Major League Baseball pulled its All-Star Game out of Georgia a day after President Biden threw his support behind the idea.  In writing the bill, Georgia lawmakers debated several high-profile changes to voting laws, including banning Sunday voting, a tradition for Black voters following church services, and getting rid of no-excuse absentee voting, a measure passed by Republicans in 2005, neither of which made it into the new law.  The effect of the new law on Georgia's 7.4 million voters will be mixed: it contains new restrictions on absentee voting, while at the same time expanding early voting opportunities. The law also formalizes provisions that were put in place to accommodate voters during the coronavirus pandemic and changes the composition of the state election board, which is charged with conducting all of Georgia's elections. The law does make significant changes to the way the state will run elections moving forward. It expands early voting access for some Georgia voters, adds an ID requirement for absentee voting, codifies the use of drop boxes with strict rules on how they can be used and sets new rules for state and local election officials. Here are 9 facts about the new Georgia voting law: Nearly 2.7 million Georgians voted early during the 2020 general election and the new law will offer more opportunities for early voting in most of Georgia's counties. There will be at least 17 days of early voting, starting on the Monday that is 22 days before Election Day until the Friday before an election.  The bill requires counties to have at least two Saturdays of early voting, with the option of offering voting on Sundays as well. Previously, Georgia required only one Saturday of early voting. Many of the larger counties, where most Georgia voters live, already offered early voting on two Saturdays, but the new law will expand access to early voting in many of the smaller, more rural counties. Counties must operate early voting from at least 9 a.m. until 5 p.m., but can offer it from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m. if they choose to offer expanded hours.   Previously in Georgia, a form of identification was required for voting in person but not for voting absentee by mail. The new law requires those requesting and returning ballots by mail to also submit a driver's license number or state ID number. If the voter does not have one, he or she can submit a photocopy of a different form of identification. The county registrar's offices or the Georgia Department of Driver Services can issue free state ID cards. When a voter returns an absentee ballot, he or she can also provide the last four digits of their Social Security number in place of an ID number. This provision replaces a signature requirement for verifying a person's identification, and it's opposed by voting rights groups who point to some studies that show that voter ID requirements tend to disproportionately affect voters of color. At the same time, incomplete or mismatched signatures have often caused ballots to be rejected. In the June 2020 primary, about 3,200 of 1.1 million mail ballots were rejected for signature issues, according to a CBS News analysis last year. As a result, the ID requirement could help election officials process ballots more efficiently.  While no-excuse absentee voting has been in place in Georgia since 2005, the state didn't authorize the use of secure drop boxes as a way to return ballots until the 2020 election, as a response to the pandemic. The new law mandates at least one drop box per county, but restricts where they may be placed and when they may be accessed.  They must be located inside the clerk's office or inside a voting location and are only going to be accessible during early voting hours, and then closed when the early voting period ends. This is a departure from the 2020 elections, when drop boxes were available 24-7. And there can only be one drop box for every 100,000 voters in a county.  The timeline for requesting and returning ballots has also shortened under the new law. Previously, voters could request a ballot 180 days out from an election. Now they can request them 78 days before an election. Ballot applications must be received by the clerk no later than 11 days prior to the election — earlier than the previous deadline.  State government officials will not be able to send unsolicited ballot request forms to voters. Only voters who request absentee ballots will receive them. Third parties can still send out ballot request forms, but the front of those forms must be marked: ""This is NOT an official government publication and was NOT provided to you by any governmental entity and this is NOT a ballot."" One of the most contentious provisions is Georgia's ban on giving voters food or water while they're in line at the polls. During the primary last June, precincts around the state were plagued by hours-long lines, and voting rights groups were quick to point out that the late spring and summer heat make the ban on distributing food and water especially onerous. Volunteers and third-party groups regularly hand out water on hot days or hot drinks on cold days to voters standing in line.   Georgia had already outlawed campaigns or other groups from distributing or displaying any campaign material within 150 feet of a polling place or within 25 feet of any voters standing in line for a polling site, and the new law now bans  giving voters any gifts, ""including but not limited to, food and drink.""  Gabriel Sterling, one of the top officials at the Georgia secretary of state's office, told CBS affiliate WMAZ that the ban is meant to prevent groups from using food and water to campaign within the restricted areas. The law provides an exception to allow poll workers to set up ""self-service water"" so people waiting in line can stay hydrated.  Georgia's new law makes a few changes to in-person voting, including efforts to mitigate long lines and changing the rules around provisional ballots.  If a voter goes to the wrong precinct in his or her county before 5 p.m., poll workers are supposed to direct that person to the correct precinct, rather than directing the voter to cast a provisional ballot. After 5 p.m., a voter arriving at the wrong polling site may cast a provisional ballot if unable to reach correct precinct before polls close. In November, about 8,200 provisional ballots were cast because a voter wasn't at his or her correct precinct. Nearly 6,800 of those votes were accepted. Overall, 17,697 provisional ballots were cast in the 2020 general election and 11,781 were accepted.  The law also attempts to address long lines, demanding that counties with any precinct with over 2,000 voters in the last election or one that kept voters waiting for over an hour to vote must create an additional precinct or add more resources to reduce wait times.  The five-person state election board will no longer be chaired by the secretary of state, who now becomes a ""non voting ex officio member."" GOP Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has been at the center of attacks by fellow Republicans for pushing back against attacks from former President Trump.  The chair and board members will be elected by the General Assembly, giving more power to the Republican-controlled state legislature. But no members of the board may serve simultaneously in the state legislature. And while elected by the legislature, the chair is supposed to be non-partisan. The new law prohibits the chair from actively participating in a political party or organization, donating to a political campaign, or running for public office during his or her service and in the two years preceding the term as chair.  The state election board has new powers over local election officials. It can, for instance,  suspend county or municipal superintendents based on performance or violation of election board rules, after first conducting a preliminary investigation and hearing. It may then appoint temporary replacements, but it can't suspend more than four officials.  CBS News didn't project a winner in the presidential race in Georgia until 10 days after Election Day, partly because it took counties so long to count the massive influx of mail ballots. There are several new provisions in SB 202 that will likely lead to faster results in future elections. Because of the pandemic, the state election board passed an emergency rule in 2020 that enabled election workers to start processing absentee ballots 15 days before Election Day in November and the January runoffs.   The new law codifies that change, meaning workers will be able to start processing, but not tabulating, absentee ballots 15 days before Election Day for future elections. County officials will be allowed to start tabulating absentee ballots after 7 a.m. on Election Day, but results can't be reported until polls close. Counties must now report returns from absentee ballots by 5 p.m. the day after Election Day or else they could face an investigation.  The new law also requires election officials to post the total number of ballots cast, including  Election Day, early voting and absentee ballots, by 10 p.m. on Election Day. The intent is to provide a clearer picture of how many votes were cast early in the counting process. Under the new law, election workers will not be able to stop counting ballots once they've started, so that they can produce faster results. With the new procedures comes a shorter timeline for counties to certify results: six days, rather than 10. The new law allows the Georgia attorney general to set up a hotline for voters to file complaints and allegations of voter intimidation or illegal activity. Georgians may also call anonymously. The attorney general is able to review each allegation to determine if it should be investigated or prosecuted.  Separately, a provision in SB 202 allows a voter to make unlimited challenges to another voter's qualifications to cast a ballot. Leading up to the 2020 election runoffs, True the Vote, a conservative group, challenged the eligibility of 360,000 voters, but courts blocked the effort. Allowing voters to make unlimited challenges may bog down election officials and could make it difficult for voters to prove they are eligible when they may have done nothing wrong. The state board of elections could establish procedures designed to make sure that illegitimate challenges don't place a burden on legitimate voters.  Following Georgia's high-profile Senate runoffs, which delivered Senate control to Democrats, the state is changing its runoff process. The law still requires a candidate to win a majority of votes to avoid a runoff, but SB 202 abbreviates the runoff period.  Previously, nine weeks separated the general election from the runoff, but the new law now requires a runoff to be held 28 days after the election. The law says early voting should start ""as soon as possible"" before a runoff, but only requires early voting to be held on Monday through Friday. Some counties may not offer weekend early voting during runoff elections, depending how long it takes to finish work from the previous election. Because of the shorter period before a runoff election, military and overseas voters will have ranked-choice voting on their general election or primary ballots."
cbs|" Just days after Coca-Cola, Delta and other major corporate names publicly denounced Georgia's controversial voting law, civil rights groups are raising the heat on big companies to help combat similar proposals across the U.S. Activists are urging Georgia-based companies like Delta, Home Depot and UPS to stop funding the political campaigns of Republican legislators behind the state's move to restrict voting rights. They also want companies to put their brands behind publicity campaigns that openly oppose similar voter law proposals in Arizona, Florida and Texas, as well as to take a stand in favor of bills in Congress aimed at expanding access to the ballot box. Georgia lawmakers passed a measure that requires voters to present a photo ID when voting by mail. The law also cuts the time people have to request an absentee ballot and limits where ballot drop boxes can be placed. Critics charge that such changes amount to the 2021 version of Jim Crow rules and other historical efforts to suppress the vote to gain a political advantage. The push from activists comes in the same week as 72 Black business executives calling for companies to speak out against Georgia's voting law. In a letter addressed to corporate America, former American Express CEO Ken Chenault and other Black leaders noted that more than 40 states are considering election changes similar to Georgia.  ""What we're saying to companies is all of the words are nice, but we need you to take action,"" Chenault told CBS This Morning. Coca-Cola, Delta and Home Depot have largely stayed mum on what concrete steps they favor to help repeal the Georgia voting law. UPS stopped short of saying it would halt political donations. Instead, it is offering less assertive measures, saying it plans to print absentee ballots for employees who ask, offer its employees to work as volunteers at polling sites on election days, and fund organizations that hold voter registration drives.   Large corporations ""know how to squash legislation that impacts their own company or industry,"" said Cliff Albright, executive director of the Georgia-based political action group Black Voters Matter. ""We expect them to do the same here."" Activists said companies should immediately stop making donations to Barry Fleming and Michael Dugan, the Georgia Republicans who co-sponsored the voting changes. Doing that ""doesn't mean they have to stop giving to the entire Republican Party,"" just those lawmakers, Albright said.  Coca-Cola has contributed $34,750 to Fleming's and Dugan's campaigns since 2018, according to data from Popular Information, a left-leaning political newsletter. Delta has donated $41,600 in total to the lawmakers while Home Depot has kicked in $34,000 and UPS has given $34,500. There is recent precedent for companies now embroiled in the Georgia fight for pulling back on their support for lawmakers. In January, Coca-Cola and UPS were among the many Fortune 500 companies that stopped contributing to Republicans in Washington who falsely claimed that former President Trump lost the 2020 election due to voter fraud. Ending political donations is one of the most immediately impactful steps a company can take to sway lawmakers, said Nse Ufot, CEO of New Georgia Project, a voter rights organization. That's because Coca-Cola, UPS and the others ""have the most powerful lobbyists and have the biggest influence in Georgia politics,"" he said. Albright noted that America's best-known brands have vast experience persuading Americans to buy their products, whether a plane ticket from Delta or cans of paint from Home Depot. Major advertising campaigns have helped these companies individually, but ads can also help stamp out efforts nationwide to pass voting laws similar to Georgia's, activists said.  Arizona and Texas could be the next states to alter voting rights, with lawmakers there considering proposals for additional ID requirements, restrictions on drop boxes and cuts to private funding for local election offices. In Arizona, SB 1713 adds the ID requirement for voting absentee. In Texas, the state senate passed SB 7 this week, a sweeping bill that would add many voting restrictions. Black Voters Matter picketed the Dallas offices of AT&T on Monday, criticizing its political donations to the leading Texas Republicans behind the voting legislation.  Activists say it isn't enough for companies to issue tepid public statements in defense of voting rights. Instead, companies should launch television and social media ads that oppose efforts in Georgia, Arizona, Texas and other states considering voter restrictions, Albright said.  ""The same way they try to convince people to have a Coke and a smile, they need to persuade people to fight voter suppression,"" he said. ""They can use all their skills, tools, marketing departments and their budgets."" As Arizona, Florida, Texas and other states mull changes to local voting rules, the federal government is also weighing an election law overhaul known as the ""For the People Act.""  If passed, the act would create same-day and online voter registration nationwide. It would also require states to overhaul their registration systems. The act seeks to expand absentee voting, limit the states' ability to remove people from voter rolls, increase federal funds for election security and reform the redistricting process. Albright said corporate chiefs must offer to testify before federal lawmakers in favor of the bill. Creating a separate public awareness campaign for that bill also would help, he added. Companies ""need to work aggressively to call for the passage"" of the For the People Act, Ufot said. "
cbs|" More than 100 of the nation's top corporate leaders met virtually on Saturday to discuss ways for companies to continue responding to the passage of more restrictive voting laws across the country, a signal that the nation's premier businesses are preparing a far more robust, organized response to the ongoing debate.  With some CEOs chiming in from Augusta National Golf Club, site of the Masters golf tournament, attendees on the high-level Zoom call included leaders from the health care, media and transportation sectors and some of the nation's leading law and investment firms.   ""The gathering was an enthusiastic voluntary statement of defiance against threats of reprisals for exercising their patriotic voices,"" said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale University management professor who helped organize the confab.   The corporate leaders ""recognize that they need to step up to the plate and are not fearful of these reprisals,"" he added. ""They're showing a disdain for these political attacks. Not only are they fortifying each other, but they see that this spreading of disease of voter restrictions from Georgia to up to possibly 46 other states is based on a false premise and its' anti-democratic.""  The nonpartisan Brennan Center, which has been tracking voting law proposals across the country, found that lawmakers in 47 states have introduced 361 bills that would restrict voting access. Of those restrictive bills, at least 55 are currently moving through legislatures in 24 states. So far, 29 of them have passed one chamber, while 26 of them have made it through a committee vote. Overall, five bills have been signed into law, including Georgia's in late March. In the wake of Georgia's new law, Delta Air Lines, Coca-Cola and Aflac Insurance, among other companies based in the Peach State, spoke out in opposition to the law. Republican leaders, including former president Trump, have in turn called for boycotts of the companies for speaking out. Liberal organizations, civil rights groups and some Democratic Party leaders have said the firms didn't speak out forcefully enough or before passage of the law, a move they argue that might have stopped the law's passage. That blowback, plus the recent decision by 72 current and former Black executives to speak out more forcefully about proposed changes to election laws inspired those on the call to act, Sonnenfeld said. ""These CEOs said, 'Enough of that, we're going to come together and reinforce our fellow CEOs.' It was a statement of affirmation that the voice of business in the political world is worthwhile,"" he said.  Organizers also stressed that the meeting was being put together long before Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell last week angrily denounced and criticized corporate leaders he said were being misled by Democratic arguments against the new laws. Traveling in Kentucky last week, McConnell urged corporate leaders to ""stay out of politics"" and warned there would be unspecified consequences for speaking out against the new laws. He later backed off those comments, but said the corporate leaders were wrong.  Participants in the meeting confirmed McConnell's comments came up, but were not a central focus of the meeting.  ""There was humor and mockery about that,"" said one participant, adding that another person on the call ""made a reference to 'just give us your money and stay quiet.' Another said, 'isn't it ironic who's talking about cancel culture?'""  ""It wasn't a primary area of discussion,"" another participant said of McConnell's comments, ""but certainly everyone is cognizant of it and aware of it. In no way was he an impetus for this – talk of doing this meeting started before he spoke out.""  Attendees included Arthur Blank, owner of the NFL's Atlanta Falcons; James Murdoch and his wife, Kathryn Hufschmid; Adam Aron, CEO of AMC Theatres; Brad Karp, chairman of the law firm Paul, Weiss; Mellody Hobson, co-CEO of Ariel Investments; Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart; Scott Kirby, CEO of United Airlines; Doug Parker, CEO of American Airlines; Chip Bergh, chairman of Levi Strauss Company; Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, multiple people familiar with the meeting told CBS News.  Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, and Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Air Lines, were also invited but unable to attend, those familiar said.   Bob Bakish, president and CEO of ViacomCBS, also attended the meeting. A spokesman for the company, which operates CBS News, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  ""We invited 120 CEO's with about 50 hours notice. We were praying for 25 and we got 90 CEO's and another 30 invited guests including legal experts, technology experts and historians,"" Sonnenfeld said.  In addition to Sonnenfeld, the meeting was organized by Lynn Forester de Rothschild, the founding partner of Inclusive Capitalism LLC, and Leadership Now, a group of Harvard University alums and corporate leaders focused on sustaining democracy.  Among those who spoke on Saturday's call were Kenneth Chenault, the former CEO of American Express, and Kenneth Frazier, the chief executive of Merck, who helped organize the drive by 72 Black executives and encouraged participants to do more.  The meeting ended with no concrete game plan or timetable, but with a general plan to draft potential responses based on a firm's size and resources.   Sonnenfeld and other participants on the call said that there was no pressure, encouragement or assistance from members of the Democratic or Republican parties, but that some had suggested reaching out to ""elder statespeople"" in both parties to assist with next steps. For now, however, the group is expected to keep political leaders out of their discussions.   ""Obviously there's been a big wake up call over the last few weeks. The business community doesn't want to be caught on their heels about this. So it's about protecting leadership and not missing out on an opportunity to do so,"" said another person familiar with the meeting.  "
cbs|" Washington — The fight over voting rights playing out in state houses across the country will likely soon move to the federal courts, with Georgia's sweeping law changing its elections policies the first facing a swell of legal challenges that will test the motivations of state lawmakers acting after the bruising 2020 election. The measure in Georgia, approved along party lines, was the first major voting law to move through state legislatures in the wake of the November election, which former President Donald Trump claimed without evidence was rife with voter fraud. Like Georgia, which has now faced backlash for its new election rules, lawmakers in dozens of states have put forth their own proposed voting changes, with Texas, Arizona and Florida next in line to consider reforms to their election systems.  But these overhauls are likely to bring with them legal battles over voting rights, with Georgia's law already challenged in several disputes mounted by civil rights groups and voting organization in the state. Resting at the heart of those challenges, legal experts told CBS News, will be Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits voting policies that discriminate on the basis of race. ""These can be litigated under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which says in statute what the 15th Amendment says, you can't discriminate [based on race] and any action, whether it is directly discriminating or has the effect of making it harder for the racial minority to vote versus the racial majority, would be illegal,"" Atiba Ellis, a professor at Marquette University Law School, told CBS News. ""From that context, if plaintiffs can demonstrate that these kinds of provisions around absentee voting, innovations from the pandemic like dropbox voting and all of these kinds of voter-friendly issues, if plaintiffs can show these things have a harsher impact on minority communities, than it's an easier case to win for those people of color."" For challenges to the measures to succeed under the Voting Rights Act, Ellis said groups bringing the cases have to show that their effects would be more detrimental to the voting opportunities for people of color. ""If the provisions can be seen as targeting, and what's more likely, impacting voters of color in this way, a court will be far more skeptical about them under the Voting Rights Act,"" he said. ""The question that was at issue in the 1960s and has been ever since is, do the laws make minority voters worse off at the end of the day? If they do, Section 2 provides a remedy."" Lawmakers in Georgia argue the more stringent rules were needed to protect the integrity of the state's elections and prevent voter fraud. But voting rights groups and civil rights activists argue in their lawsuits that several of the law's measures disproportionately harm Black and Latino voters, such as an ID requirement for voting by mail, new rules for ballot drop boxes and a shortened time frame for requesting and returning mail ballots. But the measure also expands early voting, which supporters say disprove claims the law restricts voting access. ""Unable to stem the tide of these demographic changes or change the voting patterns of voters of color, these officials have resorted to attempting to suppress the vote of Black voters and other voters of color in order to maintain the tenuous hold that the Republican Party has in Georgia,"" a suit filed by the Georgia NAACP and voting rights organizations alleges. ""In other words, these officials are using racial discrimination as a means of achieving a partisan end."" Michael Kang, a law professor at Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, said many portions of the election laws are likely to be upheld by the courts, as states have wide discretion over administration of their elections. ""Excluding VRA considerations, the state has the ability to offer the amount of early voting it thinks is appropriate and it can change the voting process to take into account its administrative concerns with a relatively free hand,"" he told CBS News. But the most serious challenges raise claims under Section 2, though he noted the provision has traditionally been applied in vote dilution cases, such as those involving redistricting, rather than vote denial cases. ""Federal courts have only been looking at these in volumes since Section 5 was taken out of action,"" Kang said.  Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act required certain jurisdictions with a history of race-based voter discrimination, many in the South, to receive approval from the Justice Department before changing their voting policies. But in 2013, the Supreme Court ruled the formula to determine which places were covered by Section 5 was unconstitutional, effectively gutting that provision. Texas, Arizona and Georgia were among the states subject to preclearance from the federal government before changing their voting rules, but the Supreme Court's decision in the 2013 case, Shelby County v. Holder, freed them of that requirement.  While the House in the last Congress passed legislation that would restore the preclearance formula in the Voting Rights Act that determined the jurisdictions covered under Section 5, the bill hasn't been reintroduced this term, though there is an appetite among Democrats and President Biden for legislation. ""At the end of the day, the democracy belongs to all of us, and actions that suggest that barriers that we can reasonably see can harm some voters more than others shouldn't exist,"" Ellis said. ""The Voting Rights Act gives some protection in that regard in terms of race, but it can give more, and it's up to Congress to authorize the formula for Section 5 preclearance in order to provide that greater level of protection."" Success for the groups challenging Georgia's law and potential fights over measures under consideration elsewhere could hinge on the result of a fight currently before the Supreme Court involving two Arizona elections rules. Democrats argued the rules — one involving the return of absentee ballots and another out-of-precinct provisional ballots — violate Section 2 and fear a sweeping ruling from the Supreme Court, now with a 6-3 conservative majority, could dismantle the provision. While the high court appeared likely to allow Arizona's two rules to stand, the justices struggled to define a standard for determining when voting rules discriminate on the basis of race in violation of Section 2. ""I don't think there is any question whatever the law that comes out of Brnovich will be applied to these challenges,"" Kang said, referring to the Arizona case. ""It's going to set the law here in some way, but whether it makes it harder for the plaintiffs to win or is going to move the law much is unclear."""
cbs|" Major U.S. companies and sports teams are starting to publicly condemn a controversial new voting law recently passed in Georgia, nearly a week after Black clergymen around the state and voting-rights advocates began criticizing corporations for their silence and threatening some of them with boycotts.  Top executives at Georgia-headquartered giants Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, as well as the country's biggest bank, JPMorgan Chase, are now issuing public statements that call the legislation ""wrong"" and ""based on a lie"" and vowing unspecified action to help change it.  Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Wednesday that voting must be accessible to all Americans. While not specifically referencing Georgia, Dimon said Chase stands against efforts that prevent Americans from being able to vote.  Meanwhile, Delta CEO Ed Bastian told employees in an internal memo Wednesday that the law ""does not match Delta's values."" ""After having time to now fully understand all that is in the bill, coupled with discussions with leaders and employees in the Black community, it's evident that the bill includes provisions that will make it harder for many underrepresented voters, particularly Black voters, to exercise their constitutional right to elect their representatives,"" Bastian said. ""That is wrong."" Citi and Microsoft also expressed concerns about the Georgia law Wednesday. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey told CNBC on Wednesday that Georgia's new voting law is ""unacceptable"" and ""a step backwards."" ""This legislation is wrong and needs to be remediated,"" Quincey said. ""We'll continue to advocate in both private and even more clearly in public."" The Atlanta Hawks basketball team and Atlanta Falcons football team also expressed disdain with the law. ""The right to vote is simply sacred,"" Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank said in a statement. ""We should be working to make voting easier, not harder for every eligible citizen."" The Georgia law, among other things, requires a photo ID in order to vote absentee by mail. That's an option that more than 1.3 million Georgia voters used during the coronavirus pandemic. It also cuts the time people have to request an absentee ballot and limits where ballot drop boxes can be placed. Democrats and voting rights groups said the law will disproportionately impact voters of color. Georgia's NAACP chapter is challenging the measure in federal court. Georgia. Gov. Brian Kemp insisted the new voting law was being misrepresented by the corporate chieftains. He also accused some business leaders of ignoring their role in the law's development. In a statement Wednesday, Kemp said Bastian's criticism of the voting law ""stands in stark contrast to our conversations with the company, ignores the content of the new law, and unfortunately continues to spread the same false attacks being repeated by partisan activists."" Bastian, Dimon and Quincey didn't offer details on how their companies plan to combat Georgia's law, but offered to keep their eye on its impact in the coming months.  Delta initially issued a statement touting some parts of the law, such as expanded weekend voting, but said ""we understand concerns remain over other provisions in the legislation and there continues to be work ahead in this important effort."" The law, which passed last week, has sparked calls for boycotts of major Georgia-based companies including Coca-Cola, Delta, Home Depot and UPS because those companies had not spoken out against it. Home Depot and UPS still haven't publicly opposed the law so far.  Perhaps part of the reason some Americans hope to hear those companies' stances is because Coca-Cola, Delta and Home Depot have governing boards that are more diverse than the average S&P 500 firm. Four out of 15 of UPS' board members are people of color, or nearly 30%. A recent study by recruiting firm Spencer Stuart found that at the 200 largest companies in the S&P 500-stock index, an average of 10% of their corporate board members were Black. Latino directors made up another 4%. For Coca-Cola, three of its 12 board members, or 25%, are people of color, while Delta and Home Depot have two diverse board members out of 12, or 17%.  A group of 72 Black business executives are hoping even more major companies will denounce Georgia's changes. In a letter addressed to corporate America, former American Express CEO Ken Chenault and other Black leaders noted that more than 40 states are considering election changes similar to Georgia. Chenault said companies must pick a side: Either you want more people to vote or you believe in voter suppression. ""The reality is, corporations have been silent on this issue and that is why we've said action has to be taken,"" Chenault told ""CBS This Morning."" The Associated Press contributed to this report."
cbs|" Georgia has been Ground Zero in the post-2020 battle over state election laws, but it is hardly the only big battleground state pushing voting changes.  Arizona, Florida and Texas are considered the next frontier for altering the way people vote, with their legislatures considering proposals for additional ID requirements, restrictions on dropboxes, and cuts to private funding for local election offices.  The three states each have growing and increasingly diverse populations and play a substantial role in the outcome of presidential contests. And they all have Republican governors and Republican majorities in the legislature.  But the political trends and the way they conduct elections differ. Donald Trump and local Republicans were successful in Texas last year, and the state already has some of the most restrictive voting laws in the country. Arizona is an emerging battleground and there, Joe Biden eked out a rare victory for Democrats. Florida, a state Mr. Trump also carried, made headlines last year because its election went so smoothly. The common theme across these states when it comes to their proposed changes reflects the national party's emphasis on elections. ""Much of the election reform that's being considered right now is based on a fantasy — a lie — the big lie,"" said David Becker, executive director and founder of the Center for Election Innovation & Research. ""Much of this reform is not necessary, by any means. The security of the election was remarkably good."" The Brennan Center, which has been tracking voting law proposals across the country, found that lawmakers in 47 states have introduced 361 bills that would restrict voting access. Of those restrictive bills, at least 55 are currently moving through legislatures in 24 states. So far, 29 of them have passed one chamber, while 26 of them have made it through a committee vote. Overall, five bills have been signed into law, including Georgia's last week.  The final bill signed into law in Georgia was a diluted version of the original proposals. While it included new restrictions, it also expanded early voting in the state. And the voter identification requirement for absentee ballots, rather than just a signature, could make processing easier on election officials and lead to the rejection of fewer ballots.  Here are the upcoming states to watch on the voting laws front:  Arizona is considering a tightening of its election laws. Most of its voters have been mailing in their votes for years, since the state started allowing mail-in voting for every registered voter 30 years ago.  One of the two main bills that has passed the state Senate since the 2020 election, SB 1485, could shrink the voter pool by getting rid of the permanent early voting list, which allows voters to automatically receive a mail ballot for every election they are eligible to vote in. If voters choose not to vote early in the primary and general election for two consecutive cycles, they risk being removed from the early voter list. Counties are supposed to notify these voters, who may then stay on the list by responding within 30 days. A previous version of the bill failed in the Senate when a Repubilcan voted against the bill, claiming he had misunderstood its provisions, but he supported SB 1485. The other bill to watch is SB 1713, which adds an ID requirement for people voting absentee. Arizona verifies absentee ballots using a signature match, but this bill would require voters to provide a number from a driver's license, state ID, tribal ID or their voter registration number, in addition to providing a signature when returning an absentee ballot. Florida was a bright spot in an election season marred by COVID-related delays. The state had a no-excuse absentee ballot program long before the pandemic, and until the 2020 election, Republicans had outpaced Democrats in mail-in voting. The state also had rules in place to process ballots before Election Day, so officials were able to report results on Election Night. After working for years to repair its reputation after the 2000 election, Florida stood out as a model in 2020.  A record number of voters participated,  Mr. Trump carried the state, and Republicans picked up House seats.  Even so, Florida Republicans are pushing for voting restrictions. The legislature is considering Senate Bill 90, focused on absentee voting. The legislation would prohibit the use of drop boxes altogether — a popular method of returning mail-in ballots — and would require voters to include a form of identification with a mail ballot in addition to a signature. The bill would prohibit anyone but an immediate family member from returning an absentee ballot. And it would require that voters who request an absentee ballot application reapply each election cycle, instead of every two cycles as is current policy.  Republican Governor Ron DeSantis has also advocated for these reforms, saying that while the election ran smoothly in Florida, ""we should not rest on our laurels."" During a committee hearing last month, Senator Dennis Baxley, who sponsored the bill under consideration, said ""It's not that there was a debacle so we have to fix it. But do we have to wait for a debacle?"" But Lake County Supervisor Alan Hays, a former Republican lawmaker, called the legislation a ""travesty,"" saying legislators are playing ""havoc with the lives of 1.5 million Floridians, not to mention the burden you've added to the lives of supervisors of election.""  Republican state senators in Michigan introduced more than three dozen election bills last week that cover a range of voting issues. There are two bills that would add a photo ID requirement: one that covers absentee voting and one for in-person voting. Currently,  voters without an ID can sign an affidavit affirming their identity, but the new bills would require them to cast a provisional ballot and to verify their identity.  There are also other bills that require approval for drop boxes and locking them at 5 p.m. the day before an election, allowing poll watchers to record vote tabulating, and banning the secretary of state from sending unsolicited absentee ballot applications or posting the application on the state's website. ""The reforms introduced today seek to make Michigan's elections more secure, more accurate and trustworthy, while at the same time streamlining participation in the elections process,""  GOP state Senator Lana Theis said in a press release last week.  There are also bills that would allow 16-to 17- and-a-half-year-olds to pre-register to vote and would establish early in-person voting on the second Saturday before an election.  Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer could veto any bills she views as too restrictive, but Republicans in Michigan have a workaround. If Whitmer vetoes a slate of bills that the legislature passes, the GOP can start a petition initiative. If they gather about 340,000 signatures, the legislature can vote on the petition initiative and a simple majority can approve it without the governor's signature.  ""If that legislation is not passed by our legislature, which I'm sure it will be, but if it's not signed by the governor then we have other plans to make sure it becomes law before 2022,"" Michigan GOP Chair Ron Weiser told party activists last week. ""That plan includes taking that legislation and getting the signatures necessary for a legislative initiative so it could become law without Gretchen Whitmer's signature."" Joe Biden won New Hampshire by seven points, but Republicans flipped the state house and senate and kept the governor's mansion. When it comes to voting laws, the state House is considering proposals that would eliminate Election Day voter registration, and would prohibit students from using their educational institution as a place of domicile for the purpose of voting. New Hampshire has the highest number of students per general population — about 11% of the state's population, according to a 2017 study.  Lawmakers in Texas are considering multiple bills that would restrict voting access in what is already one of the hardest states to vote in. A study published last year found that Texas had the most restrictive voting processes in 2020. On Thursday, the state Senate passed SB 7, a sweeping bill that would add many voting restrictions. Texas state Senator Bryan Hughes said Wednesday during a floor debate that the legislation standardizes election rules so that ""every Texan has a fair and equal opportunity to vote, regardless of where they live in the state."" Part of the bill targets two practices used by Harris County, home to Houston, during the 2020 election. It limits early voting hours to 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. after the county offered extended hours in 2020 and had a few 24-hour voting days. It also bans drive-through voting, which was added due to the pandemic and faced a late legal challenge. An analysis by the Texas Civil Rights Project  estimated that Asian, Black and Hispanic voters cast more than half of the votes at drive-thru voting sites and during extended early hours in Harris County. The bill bans county officials from sending absentee ballot applications even to voters who qualify for the process. It requires that a mail ballot be delivered to a person, effectively prohibiting the use of unstaffed drop boxes for returning mail ballots. Voters who request a mail ballot, but choose not to return it, would only be able to vote a provisional ballot. There's a requirement for people who assist voters or drive at least three voters to the polls to fill out a form providing their personal information and reason for assistance. The bill would also create strict rules for how the counties with at least one million people could distribute polling places. It also allows partisan poll watchers to record voters, including those who are receiving assistance while voting if the watcher ""reasonably believes"" that assistance is unlawful. ""It is potentially very intimidating to allow for partisan observers to record voters as they are exercising their franchise,"" Becker said.  There's also a bill in the House, HB6, that provides protections for partisan poll watchers by limiting the reasons a watcher can be removed from a polling site. It also requires people who assist voters to fill out a form and provide ""the reason assistance was necessary."" The bill also makes it a felony for a public official to distribute an absentee application to a voter who didn't request one. "
cnn|" (CNN)The state of Georgia got called out for its new voting law in the latest ""Saturday Night Live"" cold open on Saturday. In another episode of the talk show ""Oops, you did it again,"" Britney Spears, played by Chloe Fineman, hosts the pariahs of the week to decide who is ""not that innocent."" At the beginning of the segment she says, ""Speaking of pariahs, shout out to our sponsor Georgia. Voted best place not to vote,"" as the state's name appears across the bottom of the screen adorned by peaches. Fineman's Spears then invites other newsmakers of the week onto her couch. First, rapper Lil Nas X, played by Chris Redd, joins the show for making waves with religious people and sneakerheads in one week for making a music video where he is seen giving Satan a lap dance and releasing 666 pairs of limited edition Nike shoes with a drop of human blood in them. Fineman's Spears asks, ""What would you say to the religious folks that were mad because you gave Satan a lap dance?"" to which he responds, ""I would say, 'you know that wasn't the real Satan, right? It was a dude in a Halloween devil costume because the real Satan doesn't do, like, music videos. So, maybe chill.'"" Redd's Lil Nas X points out that that he didn't give the real Satan a lap dance, just an actor. Fineman's Spears then asks if he will give God a lap dance to even the playing field and he does. After the lap dance ends, cartoon skunk Pepé Le Pew, played by Kate McKinnon, arrives wearing a giant skunk suit and smoking a cigarette out of an opera cigarette holder. Fineman's Spears talks about how Le Pew has been axed from the upcoming ""Space Jam"" sequel due to his overtly sexual behavior. The skunk apologizes and says he has a lot to learn. ""I've doing the work. Reading the books like 'Women are from Mars, Skunks are from France.''"" Fineman's Spears then invites her next guest, Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, to join the crew. Gaetz, played by Pete Davidson, answers her questions punctuated by ""Family Guy"" character Quagmire's signature ""giggity"" line. She questions him about the story she deems ""so incredibly Florida."" Davidson's Gaetz then says people are targeting him because he defended President Trump. ""I'm just like Pepe here. I'm just a ladies man,"" he says. McKinnon's Pepe replies, ""No. I'm a cartoon skunk, you are a United States Congressman. Be better, ok?"" Fineman's Spears delivers her verdict at the end, marking Lil Nas X ""innocent,"" Le Pew as ""not that innocent"", and says she can't judge Gaetz but thinks others should ""judge him by his face.""

cnn|" Mayfield, Georgia (CNN)Johnny Thornton stood on his sprawling catfish farm, once a symbol of empowerment in this majority Black county, and explained how the local election board once tried to strip him of his right to vote. In 2015, after a failed attempt to shutter almost every polling location in a county three times the area of Atlanta, the Hancock County Board of Elections and Registration tried to remove 174 voters, almost all of them African American, ahead of a Sparta city election. The board even sent deputies to homes, summonsing voters to prove eligibility. The city's roll at the time included only 988 voters, so it meant about one in five potential ballots. The majority-White board ultimately clipped 53 residents from the rolls. Had Thornton and others not fought back, suing the BOER in federal court -- which in 2016 restored most voters to the rolls -- many county residents could have been disenfranchised, he said last month. ""A lot of the individuals that they were targeting, they either worked out of town or did not have the means or resources to push back,"" said Thornton, a retired special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration. ""Voter suppression through administrative chaos is my term for it."" With Georgia voters set to decide control of the US Senate in Tuesday's runoffs, the challenges to the voting rolls in Hancock County, whose residents have long fought for their right to vote, remain under the supervision of a court-appointed examiner. Legal experts say the US Supreme Court pulling teeth from the Voting Rights Act is to blame. The high court's 2013 ruling in Shelby County v. Holder effectively ended a provision that, in jurisdictions such as Hancock County, would have required preclearance for any voting changes. Since the ruling, lawyers have filed lawsuits alleging voter suppression from Alabama to Alaska. Georgia has been a particularly active battleground, but some experts say Hancock County, a reliably Democratic enclave of about 8,500 people situated between Atlanta and Augusta, is one of the most troubling examples they've seen.  'They were making Black votes disappear' Thornton has means -- a rarity in a county where per capita income is $16,704, less than half the national average. He could afford a lawyer and federal court fees, whereas many other Black residents could not. With 71% of its residents African American, Hancock is one of the Blackest counties not just in Georgia but in the nation. The percentage is even higher in Sparta, its county seat and only incorporated area. The lawsuit highlighted disparities among the Black and White populations in 2015: Black households had a median income of $22,056 ($37,083 for White); almost 34% of Black residents lived in poverty (22% for White); and 26% of Black households received food benefits (6% for White). Ahead of the 2015 Sparta elections, the lawsuit said, BOER Vice Chairwoman Nancy Stephens, who is White, began filing voter challenges as a citizen, then voting on them as a board member. When concerns were raised, a local resident began filing challenges ""in a format that closely resembled the format of those filed by the Vice Chair,"" the lawsuit said. The challengers ""consistently failed to provide credible evidence based upon personal knowledge that the challenged voters were not qualified to vote,"" the lawsuit said. ""The BOER frequently accepted hearsay, speculation, and unsubstantiated rumors provided by unnamed witnesses and anonymous individuals as sufficient evidence to remove registered Black voters."" Stephens, who is no longer vice chair but remains a BOER member, referred questions to county attorney Andrea Grant, who did not return a phone call to discuss past and present concerns residents expressed. The BOER, responding to the lawsuit, ""vigorously"" and ""strenuously"" denied illegally targeting Black voters or violating state laws. Thornton can't understand why the BOER would claim he didn't live in the county, or why the board would try to remove him from the rolls. His catfish farm is in unincorporated Mayfield, 20 minutes outside Sparta, and he wasn't eligible to vote in the city elections. What's more, he receives bills at his catfish farm, which is the address on his driver's license. He also served as county NAACP treasurer and on the Sparta Housing Authority. He owns property outside the county but spends most of his time at the catfish farm, hunting and doing maintenance. His attorney informed the elections supervisor that he could not appear before the board and would be out of town for several weeks, he said. The board removed him anyway, according to the lawsuit. Word moves quickly in Hancock County, especially when deputies are delivering summonses. Larry Webb heard the BOER was removing Black voters from the rolls and began attending meetings. ""Sitting after two of the meetings, I thought, 'What would they do if someone challenged some White voters?'"" recalled Webb, who is Black. He went through the 2014 voting roll and pulled voters he knew were dead or had moved and submitted 14 challenges. Emails included in the lawsuit revealed BOER members didn't take Webb's challenges seriously and defended White voters. According to the lawsuit, Chairwoman Kathy Ransom wrote of Webb's challenges, ""Just a guess...he's targeting folks that are 'white' :)"" Webb asked for deputies to serve summonses to the residents he challenged, but he was told the sheriff's department was now charging $50 each, he said. When Webb's 14 challenges finally went before the board, Ransom told the White resident who had been challenging Black voters that deputies would no longer serve his summonses as a ""courtesy,"" as they had in the past, the lawsuit said. The BOER determined before the hearing that four of Webb's challenged voters were dead and removed them from the rolls. Of the remaining challenges, the board nixed one voter from the rolls and moved another to inactive status. Both were Asian American, the lawsuit said. ""What they did was beyond voter suppression. If something is wrong with your voter registration, they should call you and tell you what's wrong. What they were doing is taking you off the rolls, and you wouldn't find out until the election,"" Webb told CNN. ""They were making Black votes disappear."" 'It had a discriminatory effect' In Shelby County v. Holder, the US Supreme Court ruled that the ""coverage formula"" dictating which jurisdictions were subject to preclearance in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was unconstitutional. The formula, the court said in its 5-4 ruling, was ""based on 40-year-old facts having no logical relation to the present day."" Since the death of the Georgia civil rights icon US Rep. John Lewis, politicians and activists have called for Congress to honor Lewis by crafting an updated coverage formula, as permitted by the high court, but it hasn't come to pass. Without the formula, which forced jurisdictions with a history of discrimination, most of them Southern, to prove proposed changes to voting laws did not discriminate against minorities, many jurisdictions undertook changes to their elections procedures that voting rights experts say have a disproportionate impact on minorities. Julie Houk with the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, who worked on the Hancock County case, disagrees with the Supreme Court's finding ""that the conditions that originally justified these measures no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions."" Why then did jurisdictions across the South and beyond immediately take actions that would have otherwise required preclearance under the previous iteration of the Voting Rights Act? Texas and North Carolina moved to stiffen voter ID laws, which already hampered Black and Latino voters, Houk said. The Lawyers' Committee has also challenged restrictive absentee ballot rules and fought voter purges, redistricting decisions and efforts to limit ballot drop boxes -- which tend to burden minorities the most. In Macon-Bibb County, Georgia, Houk said, elections officials moved a Black voting precinct -- in a community that had rocky relations with law enforcement -- to the sheriff's office, which she called ""very problematic"" as it threatened to dissuade African Americans from voting. The Lawyer's Committee got the precinct moved, she said. Georgia has been especially problematic, said Helen Butler, executive director of the Atlanta-based Coalition for the People's Agenda, whose team worked on the Hancock County case, as well as a handful in other Georgia counties. In 2015, Georgia's then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp cited Shelby in informing counties they were ""no longer required to submit polling place changes to the Department of Justice."" Numerous groups have reported added hardships on Georgia's minority voters since the US Supreme Court decision. American Public Media reporters found in 2019 that tens of thousands of voters state officials said had likely died or moved away had, in fact, not. The ACLU of Georgia reported in September that of 313,243 voters removed from the state rolls in 2019, almost 200,000 were likely erroneously purged. While the secretary of state said it was routine maintenance, removing voters it had classified as inactive, Andrea Young, state ACLU executive director, countered that the state's method of maintenance was ""prone to tremendous error."" Two weeks before the November general election, ProPublica, in collaboration with public broadcasters, reported, ""The state's voter rolls have grown by nearly 2 million since the US Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, but polling locations have been cut by almost 10%, with Metro Atlanta hit particularly hard."" The outlets published their report under the point-blank headline, ""Why do nonwhite Georgia voters have to wait in line for hours? Their numbers have soared, and their polling places have dwindled."" ""I'm not saying they intentionally discriminated,"" Butler told CNN, ""but it had a discriminatory effect."" 'Way past problems with Black and White' Even with all the battles unfolding in Georgia and across the nation, Hancock County stands out, experts say. Houk's colleague at the Lawyers' Committee, John Powers, who previously reviewed preclearance submissions for the US Justice Department, told a webzine in 2016 the Hancock County case was ""the worst case of voter suppression that I have ever seen."" ""Hancock County is just one example and probably one of the worst examples of how Shelby County is impacting individual voters,"" Houk said. ""This type of change in process would've been governed by preclearance. It would've stopped this whole process. ... This is why preclearance was so important: Discriminating against Black voters would've been rejected."" While the county voluntarily entered into a consent decree, agreeing to the appointment of an examiner to oversee any changes to its voting rolls, Sparta Mayor Allen Haywood insists the agreement was unnecessary. There was no racist intent in the board's work, he said. The truth about 2015 ""depends on what side you talk to,"" he said. No candidate could win in the city, now estimated at 89% African American, without securing a swath of the Black vote, said Haywood, who is White and is certain he was elected on his promise of reform, he said. ""The board of elections was just trying to clean the rolls,"" he said. ""It's not a racial problem except for those who want to keep it that way. People just want to see a change here. They knew that if I got in, I was going to make things transparent."" He won the 2015 Sparta mayoral election but stepped down after news surfaced he had a 1982 felony gambling conviction in Alabama. He was betting on football games across state lines, he told CNN, and wasn't aware the conviction rendered him ineligible to seek office. He had his record expunged and two years later won a City Council seat, serving as mayor pro tempore before ascending to the mayor's office in 2019 ""with less than 80 White votes cast,"" he said. Haywood inherited numerous problems, including a seven-figure tax-and-utility bill, the paying down of which has been a priority of his administration. He also hopes to lure investment back to the county and is considering a historic tourism initiative, but myriad problems persist, as evidenced by the dilapidated downtown. Largely built before 1930, many stores lay not just empty but in disarray. A colorful butterfly mural on one corner proclaims, ""This is Sparta,"" while another mural honors Methodist bishops Lucius Holsey, an emancipated slave, and George Pierce, who owned Holsey's would-be wife before mentoring Holsey and assigning him to his first church. Cast-iron storefronts and other architectural relics reminisce the charm Sparta exuded in its heyday, as local businesses post signs encouraging residents to spend money locally and embrace the historic preservation of downtown, an entry on the National Register of Historic Places. ""We are way past problems with Black and White here,"" Haywood said. ""Now, people are excited things are getting fixed."" 'A disproportionate lack of growth' Once fat on cotton and timber, Hancock was one of the richest counties in the state. It had a progressive reputation. Black residents, who have long been the majority, could own land and aspire, according to the book, ""Black Boss: Political Revolution in a Georgia County."" After cotton crumbled, Hancock was destitute, the book explains. Before the Voting Rights Act of 1965, it had no Black elected officials until John McCown -- an activist more in the mold of Stokely Carmichael than Martin Luther King Jr. -- came to town, luring investment and ushering Black residents to power. By 1968, Hancock was the first US county since Reconstruction ""to come under Black political control, in large part because of the charismatic leadership of McCown,"" who became county commissioner, the book says. By the mid-1970s, African Americans held almost every elected office. McCown remains revered among many Black residents, despite investigations into his alleged misspending of grant money and other improprieties. They consider his achievements landmarks, including an affordable housing project and job creators like a cinder block factory and Thornton's now-defunct catfish farm. McCown's antebellum home still stands, abandoned and in need of upkeep. McCown's efforts weren't always well received by White folks, many residents also recall, and when tensions flared over desegregation in 1971, the city and McCown's ""hunting club"" went on machine gun-buying sprees that required the intervention of Gov. Jimmy Carter and the US Justice Department, UPI reported. A 1976 plane crash killed McCown, and a federal investigation into his fundraising killed the county's resurrected prosperity, but his legacy survived in the Black leaders succeeding him. ""He created a political strategy, and African Americans voted themselves into power,"" Thornton said. ""It has come to a point where (Hancock County) is one of the most impoverished in America. There is a wives' tale -- I don't know if it's true or not -- that some political leaders in Georgia have always said that if we can't vote the people of Hancock County out, we'll starve them out -- and there's been a disproportionate lack of growth to this particular community."" 'Folks decided voting wasn't worth it' The BOER ""strenuously denied"" that it was illegally targeting Black voters with its challenges but agreed to enter the consent decree and abide by the standards and procedures the decree lays out. The court also ordered the defendants to pay more than $500,000 in attorneys' fees and other expenses, court documents show. As part of the consent decree, the BOER agreed to ""not engage in discriminatory challenges to voters' eligibility,"" and to adhere to certain procedures in such challenges, according to court documents. It also restored certain voters to its rolls and agreed not to take action on other voters restored to the rolls for at least two federal election cycles. The decree also outlined the appointment of an examiner, ""who will review the BOER's actions regarding list maintenance and voter challenges based on residency"" and make recommendations on how to comply with state law and the consent decree, a court order says. ""If the BOER disagrees with or does not follow the recommendations any party may bring that issue to the Court's attention,"" the decree says. Atlanta attorney R. Gary Spencer was named examiner in June 2018. His term will run to December 2021. The consent decree will not expire until early 2023. Butler considers the consent decree a victory preserving the legacy of Black empowerment in Hancock County, but it did not come without some casualties, she said. ""It had a chilling effect on voters,"" she said. ""A lot of folks decided voting wasn't worth it."" Despite the voting rolls growing by a few dozen electors since 2012, she laments that many voters were intimidated by the deputies and the summonses. They still haven't returned to the polls. Several residents -- including Thornton, Webb and former Sparta registrar Marion Warren -- each know multiple voters who never voted again after the deputies came to their homes, they say. ""It will affect several elections down the road because people will say that I'm not going to be bothered by this ever again. I'm not going to vote,"" Warren said. ""You have virtually destroyed their whole trust in the system altogether."" Aside from Stephens, Robert Ingram, who is Black and now chairs the board, is the only remaining member of the 2015 BOER. He did not return a message from a CNN reporter seeking to discuss present-day ramifications to the 2015 challenges. The federal lawsuit cites a half dozen Black voters he defended during the challenges. 'Virtually destroyed their whole trust' Hancock County has been ""sort of noneventful"" since Spencer was appointed examiner, he said. The county has submitted voters it wants removed, as instructed, and during the November election, the NAACP ""seemed to think everything went OK,"" he said. Spencer's team is ""always concerned,"" he said, and events happening at the state and national level, including Georgia's secretary of state calling to end no-excuse absentee voting and President Donald Trump challenging elections results, only exacerbate his worry. At this point, however, he has seen nothing in Hancock County that would spur him to request an extension to his term or the consent decree, but before making any final decision, ""I would certainly check on it just to do some due diligence."" Thornton and others remain worried. The county is ""playing with house money,"" he said. Where Thornton shelled out his own earnings to defend his right to vote, the county used his tax dollars to fight him. Again, he emphasized, most Hancock County residents don't have his resources. ""I am definitely worried that once the consent decree ends that the BOER will start its same antics again,"" he said. ""They can say, 'Hey, we'll get everybody except Johnny Thornton, and the other people that we go for might not have the legal means or expertise to push back or to fight against the system.'"" Warren, in addition to previously serving as Sparta's registrar, is a Black county resident who began filming BOER meetings in 2015 when he learned of the challenges. He had trouble last year, he said, when applying for a mail-in ballot. A county elections official told him his home wasn't his registered address, he said. He isn't alleging any misbehavior -- he was able to sort it out before the general election -- but such a county notice might have been enough to deter a less-resolute voter from casting her or his ballot. In poor, rural areas like Hancock County, minor hiccups such as a rainy day or a washed-out road can have major effects on voting. Because there is so little work in the county, people work multiple jobs or leave the county for employment, making it difficult to find time to vote, he said. Residents can struggle with transportation in a county it takes almost an hour to traverse end to end. There are literacy and education issues at play as well, he said. ""All you've got to do is find an obstacle that you can put between them and the polling place. It don't matter what it is,"" he said. ""Because we are as a race, we are very critical of the voting process in the first place."" "
cnn|" Washington (CNN)GOP state senators in Georgia introduced a slate of bills on Monday that seek to roll back voter access in the state, such as ""no excuse"" absentee voting and automatic voter registration. If passed, the nine proposed measures -- which follow elections where Democrats made historic gains in the state -- could considerably reshape Georgia's electorate and have a significant impact on the 2022 midterm elections. Republicans, echoing a baseless argument frequently made by former President Donald Trump, claim that the measures are necessary to prevent voter fraud, even though no evidence exists that it played a factor in the outcome of the 2020 election. One of the bills would require an excuse to vote absentee, undoing a 2005 Republican-backed law allowing no-excuse absentee voting. Under the bill, voters would need to be 75 years old or older, absent from their precinct, observing a religious holiday, have a physical disability, be required to provide constant care for someone with a physical disability, or required to work ""for the protection of the health, life, or safety of the public during the entire time the polls are open"" to qualify to vote absentee. The bills would also ban ballot drop boxes and require voters to provide identification when they request an absentee ballot application. Another one of the bills would limit who can distribute absentee ballot applications to Georgia election officials and campaigns, blocking outside groups and nonprofit organizations from sending applications to voters. Other measures introduced by state Republican lawmakers would expand poll watcher access, prohibit new Georgia residents from voting in runoffs, and mandate monthly updates to election officials of voters who have died. Senate President Pro Tempore Butch Miller, who cosponsored the bills, said they ""vary in their approach for reasserting confidence in an election system which has lost credibility with a majority of Georgians."" ""I want every legal vote counted, and I want better access for all voters. Accusing our reform efforts of suppression is a political tactic, pure and simple. Even those of us who never claimed that the election was stolen recognize that the electorate has lost confidence in the legitimacy of the system. We must work to restore that,"" he said in a statement to CNN. The package was roundly rebuked by Democratic lawmakers in the state after being introduced. ""How pathetic is it to respond to election losses by changing election rules rather than changing course on policy and tone?"" state Democratic Rep. Josh McLaurin tweeted. His message was echoed by Democratic state Sen. Nikki Merritt, who tweeted, ""GA Republicans are so weak the only way they can win is by blocking your access to voting."" Teri Anulewicz, a Democratic state representative, similarly tweeted: ""Good legislation rights a wrong. It fixes a problem. Voter suppression won't change why GA rejected the GOP in Nov & January."" The Georgia Senate Democrats Twitter account also stated that the proposed measures are what happens when ""Democrats win in GA.""  ""These bills introduced today by the GA Senate GOP are a laundry list of #votersupression tactics meant to roll back voter participation, aimed specifically at reversing the impact Black voters and other voters of color,"" the post read. Democrats won both of Georgia's US Senate seats in January runoff elections, and in November, President Joe Biden became the first Democrat to win the presidential election in the Peach State in nearly three decades. Despite the absence of any widespread security issues with voting nationwide, GOP lawmakers in battleground states across the country have pushed for additional voting restrictions. In Pennsylvania, Republicans are looking to repeal a no-excuse absentee voting law passed in 2019 through the state's GOP-led Legislature. And in Arizona, one GOP-sponsored bill would repeal the state's permanent early voting list, which allows a voter to automatically receive a ballot by mail for every election. This story has been updated with additional information. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the year no-excuse absentee voting was made law. It was 2005. CNN's Kelly Mena contributed to this report."
cnn|" (CNN)Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Monday that he will not throw out the ceremonial first pitch at the Texas Rangers home opener because of Major League Baseball's stance on voter integrity laws. Abbott, a Republican, informed the Rangers of his decision in a letter ahead of Monday's game, according to a news release. He cited the MLB's decision to move the organization's All-Star game and draft in Atlanta in response to Georgia's restrictive voting law. ""Major League Baseball adopted what has turned out to be a false narrative about the election law reforms in Georgia, and based on that false narrative, moved the MLB All-Star game from Atlanta,"" Abbott wrote in the letter. ""It is shameful that America's pastime is not only being influenced by partisan political politics, but also perpetuating false political narratives. This decision does not diminish the deep respect I have for the Texas Rangers baseball organization, which is outstanding from top to bottom."" Abbott also said he will no longer participate in any event held by MLB, and that the State of Texas will not seek to host the All-Star game or any other MLB special events. The Georgia law, recently signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, includes new voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, empowers state officials to take over local elections boards, limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to approach voters to give them food and water as they wait in line. It has prompted lawsuits from civil rights groups, a sharp denunciation from President Joe Biden and calls for businesses to take action against the state. Republican proponents of the law say the critics who accuse them of ""voter suppression"" are mischaracterizing both their intentions and key provisions of the law. They claim the law not only makes Georgia's elections more secure but that it expands access to voting. ""Major League Baseball caved to fear, political opportunism, and liberal lies,"" Kemp said in a statement after the MLB announced its decision. ""Georgians - and all Americans - should fully understand what the MLB's knee-jerk decision means: cancel culture and woke political activists are coming for every aspect of your life, sports included. If the left doesn't agree with you, facts and the truth do not matter."" The Atlanta Braves said the franchise is ""deeply disappointed"" by the decision to move the game. ""This was neither our decision, nor our recommendation and we are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city,"" according to a statement from the team. ""Unfortunately, businesses, employees, and fans in Georgia are the victims of this decision."" In a statement to CNN, a Rangers spokesperson said Audrey Simmons, a fifth grade science teacher from Dunn Elementary in Arlington, Texas, will now throw the first pitch. Sydney Maxwell, a nurse at Medical City Healthcare, will catch the first pitch. ""Frontline heroes will be participating in today's ceremonial first pitch prior to the game,"" the spokesperson said. Monday's game between the Rangers the Toronto Blue Jays, held at Globe Life Field, is one of the first sporting events with full fan capacity. Rangers spokesperson John Blake told CNN in March that the overall capacity of the stadium is 40,518. CNN's Homero De la Fuente, Jenn Selva, Dave Close, Steve Almasy, Daniel Dale and Dianne Gallagher contributed to this report."
cnn|" (CNN)Republicans in key electoral states continue to advance bills to clamp down on ballot access, even as voting and civil rights groups move to challenge new voting restrictions in the battleground state of Georgia. Arizona, Texas, Michigan and Florida are among the states where lawmakers are pushing restrictions, many of them citing former President Donald Trump's false claims of election fraud as a reason to tighten the rules around voting -- moves that would also hinder Democratic-leaning voters. In Arizona, which like Georgia was crucial to President Joe Biden's victory last November, pending bills would repeal the state's permanent early voting list and require identification when submitting absentee ballots. In Texas, lawmakers want to ban drive-through voting and bar election officials from sending unsolicited absentee ballot applications to voters. And in Michigan, a package of nearly 40 bills touches on nearly every aspect of elections -- from imposing new identification requirements on absentee ballot requests to overhauling the canvassing boards that certify election results. Republicans in Michigan say they are discussing possibly deploying an obscure state law on petition initiatives to bypass a likely veto of their election restrictions by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Bills pushed by Republicans in Florida would set new restrictions on drop boxes and mail-in voting. These efforts all come on the heels of Georgia last week rushing through a sweeping law that limits ballot boxes, grants the state legislature more power over the state board of elections and makes it a misdemeanor to approach voters as they wait in line with food and water. Voting advocates say they may be powerless to stop all the measures now in play in Republican-controlled states. ""It is an all-sides attack on voting rights,"" said Sylvia Albert, director of voting and elections for the voter advocacy group Common Cause. ""The reality is that there are hundreds of suppressive proposed laws around the country. ""Honestly, it's impossible to even keep track of them,"" she said, ""much less fight back."" Here's a deeper look at proposals in several key states: Texas A far-reaching election bill in Texas would make it harder to vote in several ways. It would ban the use of drive-through voting -- a technique that was challenged by Republicans last year in Harris County, which includes heavily Democratic Houston, after being introduced to make it easier to cast ballots during the pandemic. Harris County also had sought to send in mail-in ballot applications to more than 2 million voters with instructions on how to determine whether the voters qualified to vote absentee. (The state Supreme Court blocked the effort.) Texas already sets strict limits on who can vote by mail: Those 65 or older, people with disabilities or illness, those confined to jail or those who will be out of the county during the election. Under the proposed law disabled voters who want to cast their ballots by mail would have to prove their disability -- such as providing a doctor's note or written documentation from the Social Security Administration. Michigan Michigan Republicans last week introduced a package of bills aimed at restricting voting access in a state that narrowly swung back to Biden in 2020. The bills, which state Republicans describe as an effort to modernize and secure the state's elections, include provisions that would limit ballot drop box hours, require voters to provide photo ID when applying for an absentee ballot and block unsolicited absentee ballot applications from being mailed out en masse. Republicans are considering a way to bypass Whitmer, Ted Goodman, a spokesman for the Michigan Republican Party, told CNN. State Republicans could blend together the bills and try to pass them through a petition initiative, If Republicans gather the more than 340,000 signatures needed, the GOP-controlled legislature could make the measure law and Whitmer could not veto it ""We plan and can make these necessary changes with the support of the people. And with or without the governor,"" Goodman, told CNN on Tuesday. ""We want to make it easier to vote and to protect every eligible voter's voice."" Michigan Senate Minority Leader Sen. Jim Ananich, a Democrat, has criticized the Republican tactics. ""They seem desperate to make sure people don't vote,"" he previously told CNN. ""When people are desperate, they go to extreme measures,"" Ananich said. Arizona A key measure in Arizona would remove infrequent voters from the so-called ""permanent early voting list."" The list was created with bipartisan support more than a dozen years ago and now is used by 3.2 million people who use it to automatically receive their ballots by mail for each election. Traditionally about 80% of Arizonans vote early by mail; that surged to about 88% in in the 2020 election. Republican lawmakers have said allowing voters to sign up in perpetuity to vote by mail increases the odds that ballots could be sent to people who have died or moved. The measure, which has passed the Senate and is pending in the Arizona House, would remove from the voting list anyone who did not use a mail ballot in the primary and general election for two consecutive election cycles. Had that provision been law in 2020, it would have affected about 200,000 voters, said Alex Gulotta, Arizona state director of All Voting is Local. About 50,000 of those voters were Latino, he added. Biden won the traditionally Republican state by nearly 10,500 votes. A separate measure would require identification on mail-in ballots, including the voter's date of birth, driver's license number or a voter registration number. Florida A 45-page bill under consideration in Florida would bring a raft of new restrictions to voting in the Sunshine State. It would limit who can return an absentee ballot on behalf of another voter, set restrictions on the use of ballot drop boxes and add new identification requirements to vote by mail. Another bill would limit vote-by-mail applications to one election cycle. Currently, voters can apply to cast their ballots by mail roughly every two years. As a result, Floridians who cast their ballots by mail in 2020 would need to apply to do so again for the 2022 elections if the change became law. Myrna Perez, director of the voting rights and elections program at the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice, said the myriad proposals under consideration underscore the need for congressional action on voting legislation, including an update of the Voting Rights Act. The US Supreme Court in 2013 rendered invalid provisions of the law that required states with a history of discrimination to seek the approval of the Department of Justice or a federal court before changing their electoral policies. ""It's not going to be feasible or possible to sit around imagining every dastardly way in which somebody would come up to try and restrict the vote,"" Perez said. "

cnn|" (CNN)Georgia voting rights groups are denouncing a sweeping voting bill introduced this week by Republican state legislators as a ""direct attack on democracy"" and on Black voters. The bill comes as Georgia has become ground zero for election law changes in the wake of the 2020 election. Republicans in the state, citing baseless allegations of voter fraud pushed by former President Donald Trump and other GOP officials, have moved to roll back access to mail-in voting and early voting. The Republican House bill would give counties less time to send out absentee ballots and do away with Sunday voting, among other measures. ""After stunning losses in the general election and January runoffs, it's no mystery why Georgia Republicans have rushed to enact restrictions on early, absentee and weekend voting. They know their only hope for winning elections is to restrict the right to vote and silence Black voices,"" said New South super PAC founder Nsé Ufot in a press release. ""Georgia Republicans saw what happens when Black voters are empowered and show up at the polls, and now they're launching a concerted effort to suppress the votes and voices of Black Georgians."" The new voting bill is the latest effort by the GOP to clamp down after the record turnout in the state for the November election and Senate runoffs that turned the state blue. Georgia state senate Republicans just two weeks ago introduced their own sweeping voting bill including measures that would repeal no-excuse absentee voting and automatic voter registration. Both bills look to limit the use of drop boxes, impose a voter ID requirement and expand poll watcher access. ""These new burdens will disproportionately fall on communities of color and other historically disenfranchised groups. Eliminating Sunday early voting blatantly targets a mobilizer of voters of color: Black churches that run Souls to the Polls operations,"" Nancy Abudu, deputy legal director for the Southern Poverty Law Center Fund, said in a statement. State lawmakers push for voting changes ahead of 2022 Overall, Republicans across the country have made voting laws a priority for this session. A recent analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice found three times as many pieces of legislation at the state level to restrict voting access as there were at this time a year ago. Republican state legislators and secretaries of state on Wednesday announced the creation of a commission that will examine current voting laws. Nearly 30 voting rights groups pushed back against the Georgia bill, including the Georgia NAACP and Fair Fight Action, demanding in a joint letter to Republican House Speaker David Ralston and Rep. Barry Fleming, chair of the Special Committee on Election Integrity to put a ""pause on deliberations"" of the bill. ""We the undersigned demand that further hearings on HB 531 not be held until Monday, February 22 at the earliest to give advocates and legislators time to properly read and fully analyze the profound legal implications of this bill,"" read the letter. CNN has reached out to Fleming for comment. Ralston spokesman Kaleb McMichen told CNN on Friday morning that the Speaker hadn't received the letter. ""The Speaker heard complaints about the integrity of Georgia's elections following both the 2018 and 2020 general elections. As such, he formed the Special Committee on Election Integrity to address the lack of public confidence in election results,"" said McMichen in an email response to CNN. As of Thursday morning, the bill was under public comment in the Special Election Integrity Committee. ""As with all legislation it will be thoroughly debated and may be changed at any point during the legislative process,"" added McMichen. "
cnn|" (CNN)President Joe Biden said he would ""strongly support"" moving this year's Major League Baseball All-Star Game out of Georgia following the passage of a sweeping elections bill that brings a wave of new voting restrictions to the state. ""I think today's professional athletes are acting incredibly responsibly. I would strongly support them doing that,"" Biden told ESPN in an interview on Wednesday. ""People look to them. They're leaders."" The legislation, which was signed last week by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, imposes voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, empowers state officials to take over local elections boards, limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to approach voters to give them food and water as they wait in line. ""Look at what's happened across the board. The very people who are victimized the most are the people who are the leaders in these various sports, and it's just not right,"" Biden said in the interview. ""This is Jim Crow on steroids, what they're doing in Georgia and 40 other states."" Kemp responded to Biden's comments in an interview with Fox News on Thursday, calling the move ""ridiculous."" ""When the President of the United States says something, you know a lot of people pay attention. But what Joe Biden needs to do is look at the side-by-side of Georgia and Delaware,"" Kemp said. ""He's focused on trying to get Major League Baseball to pull the game out of Georgia, which is ridiculous."" Biden swiftly condemned the Georgia measure after its passage last week, calling it ""Jim Crow in the 21st Century"" and ""an atrocity,"" adding that the Justice Department is ""taking a look"" at the measure. His latest comments, however, come as opponents of the law call for the boycotts of high-profile Georgia-based companies such as Delta Air Lines, Coca-Cola and Home Depot, with critics saying they say didn't do enough to defeat the measure. The CEOs of Coca-Cola and Delta have since issued public statements criticizing the legislation. Georgia is one of several states where Republicans have moved swiftly to either roll back access to voting or put new obstacles in the way of voters following losses in the 2020 presidential and US Senate elections. More than 360 bills with restrictive provisions have been introduced in 47 states as of March 24, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, which is tracking the measures. The All-Star Game is currently scheduled to take place at the Atlanta Braves' Truist Park on July 13. "

cnn|" (CNN)By passing one of the nation's most restrictive voting bills, Republican lawmakers in Georgia have forgotten a lesson from the past and are setting themselves up for defeat in the future. The sweeping bill, signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, imposes new voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to approach voters in line to hand them food and water. Kemp said the law allows Georgia to ""take another step toward ensuring our elections are secure, accessible, and fair."" Voting rights advocates, though, said it's a thinly disguised and racist attempt to suppress the Black vote. ""No one but Pee Wee Herman believed them when they talked about the 'integrity of the vote,'"" says the Rev. Tim McDonald, an Atlanta-based pastor who founded the African American Ministers Leadership Council. His group created ""Souls to the Polls,"" a get-out-the-vote movement among Black churches nationwide. Earlier versions of the Georgia elections bill would have virtually eliminated early Sunday voting, which is popular with Black voters. ""Black folks are not stupid. We know their tricks. We know their motivation,'' McDonald says. ""They are the [Ku Klux] Klan in three-piece suits.""  What's happened in Georgia is part of a national trend. So far this year Republican lawmakers in more than 40 states have introduced more than 250 bills to restrict voting. But it may prove to be a clumsy political miscalculation. There's growing evidence to suggest that voter restriction laws sometimes backfire against their proponents. By attacking voting rights Georgia Republicans have abandoned a GOP political strategy that helped them win close elections. And they have angered a powerful bloc of Black voters in Georgia who have already mobilized against them.  Republicans made inroads with Black voters under George W. Bush Consider one of Georgia Republicans' first big mistakes: targeting ""Souls to the Polls"" in earlier versions of their voting bill. Restrictive voting laws are more effective if they're dressed in race-neutral language such as ""election integrity"" or ""ballot security.'' But the Georgia GOP floated proposals earlier this year to virtually eliminate early Sunday voting, which was seen as a direct attack on the Black electorate. Many Black churches ferry voters to the polls on Sundays during the early voting period.  The ""Souls to the Polls"" tradition was launched in 1998 by McDonald, the Atlanta pastor, and a group of fellow church leaders. Members of the group had traveled to South Africa to witness the nation's first free elections and were inspired by the variety of early voting options offered there. They came up with the slogan over dinner at a Washington hotel. McDonald says that by targeting ""Souls to the Polls,"" Georgia Republicans didn't even try to disguise their hostility toward Black voters. ""They know it's being perceived as racist, but they are so racist that they don't care,"" says McDonald, senior pastor of the First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta. Georgia Rep. Barry Fleming, who co-sponsored the voting bill and is chairman of the state legislature's Special Committee on Election Integrity, did not respond to an interview request from CNN. A spokesman for the Georgia Republican Party did not respond to a similar request for comment. Brad Raffensperger, Georgia's secretary of state, released a statement Friday saying the new Georgia law expands access to voting and offers new security measures.  ""The cries of 'voter suppression' from those on the left ring hollow,"" said Raffensperger, a Republican. ""I'm a straight shooter. I call it like I see it. I did that to the chagrin of many in my own party when I spoke out against the false claim that Georgia has systematic voter fraud. And I'm doing it now. ""Their cataclysmic predictions about the effects of this law are simply baseless,"" he added. ""The next election will prove that, but I won't hold my breath waiting for the left and the media to admit they were wrong.""   But Raffensperger's words may do little to undo the Republicans' alienation of Black churchgoers, a group that the GOP used to court with notable success. Not long ago, the GOP saw Black church members as natural allies and aggressively encouraged them to vote. Black voters tend to skew liberal on politics but conservative on many social issues. Only 29% of Black voters consider themselves liberal, according to a 2020 Pew Research Center survey. President George W. Bush saw Black pastors as potential allies and launched an aggressive outreach to Black churchgoers with his brand of ""compassionate conservatism"" during his two terms in office. Bush and the Republican Party appealed to Black voters by highlighting issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage and school vouchers. They also launched a faith-based initiative that provided grants for social services to Black churches.  As Bush's political strategist Matthew Dowd once said: ""The minister is the No. 1 influencer in the African American community."" In return, Black churchgoers helped Bush win reelection in 2004. In Florida, for example, Bush received 13% of the Black vote -- almost twice the 7% he received in 2000. And in Ohio that year, Bush more than doubled his share of Black voters from four years earlier. Republicans under Bush made such dramatic inroads with Black voters that GOP leaders talked boldly of a ""realignment"" that would begin with support from Black churches. Bush won 13% of the Black vote in 2004, but some Republicans talked about winning a quarter of the Black vote.  But recent moves by the GOP are alienating the Black faith community Bush was appealing to a conservative tradition that has long existed in the Black community, says Jemar Tisby, author of ""How to Fight Racism."" Tisby is a historian who has written about the relationships between Black and White evangelical churches. Tisby alluded to a trend that surprised some observers of last year's presidential election. Former President Donald Trump won a larger share of the Black vote in 2020 than he did in 2016. Some traced his appeal to growing support from Black men.  ""There has always been a strand of Black people, particularly Black men, who have been enticed by the conservative rhetoric of the Republican Party,"" Tisby says. ""The Republican talking points about individual responsibility and fiscal conservatism appeal to some Black religious folks who say we don't need a handout because we can create Black businesses and communities of our own."" That strategy has since changed, Tisby says. ""I don't see the Republican Party trying to connect with the Black church (anymore),"" he says. ""They're doing voter suppression so they don't have to reach out to Black voters."" By supporting voter restrictions, Republicans are now alienating Black pastors such as Bishop Rudolph McKissick, Jr., senior pastor of the Bethel Church in Jacksonville, Florida, one the oldest and largest Black churches in the state. McKissick remembers when the Republican-controlled legislature in Florida passed laws in 2011 that eliminated early Sunday voting. He says the move ""galvanized his church."" Pastors ramped up voter education and found creative new ways to get Black voters to the polls.  It appears to have worked. In 2012, President Barack Obama received 196,657 votes in Duval County, where Jacksonville is located -- more than 5,000 votes more than he got there four years earlier, before the state law was changed. Eight years later Joe Biden received 252,556 votes in Duval County, becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the county in more than 40 years. McKissick believes the debate over ""Souls to the Polls"" and other proposed voter restrictions in Georgia may backfire. ""It can, but only if Black leaders push the passion button on people and say we refuse to let them take us back to the days when we had no rights,"" he says.  Georgia Republicans may be setting themselves up for another crushing defeat Black leaders won't have to push the passion button in Georgia, because that button was pressed a long time ago. Georgia has some of the most organized and mobilized groups of Black voters, thanks to Stacey Abrams, who may be the shrewdest and most tenacious voting rights advocate in the nation. Many of these Black voters remember when Abrams lost a close race for Georgia governor in 2018, a contest tainted by allegations of voter suppression. Kemp, Abrams' opponent, ran for governor while also holding onto his position as the state's chief elections officer -- a position many viewed as a conflict of interest.  The perception that the GOP is trying to suppress the Black vote will only make Black voters in Georgia more determined to vote in 2022, when Abrams is widely expected to run against Kemp again, says the Rev. Jamal Byrant, senior pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Lithonia, Georgia. ""Georgia is frankly becoming browner and more progressive, and the Republicans are having anxiety about the upcoming gubernatorial election and they're trying to do everything in their power to stop the wave,"" Bryant says. ""You're going to see a whole lot of first-time voters, younger voters and disillusioned and disenfranchised voters heading back to the polls because they realize what's at stake,"" Bryant says. There is evidence to back up Bryant's prediction. A growing body of research suggests that the passage of voter ID laws may in some cases motivate Black voters and spark voter organizing efforts.  One study examining the impact of the Supreme Court's 2013 Shelby decision, which gutted the Voting Rights Act, suggested that voting restrictions may actually increase Black turnout in elections. The Shelby decision made it easier for states to pass voter restriction laws after the high court removed the ""preclearance"" provision from the Voting Rights Act. Under preclearance, a state with a history of racial discrimination in elections had to get permission from the federal government for instituting any changes to how they run elections. The study, which was cited in the New York Times, said the Shelby decision may have actually increased Black turnout in the 2016 presidential election in some states where preclearance was removed.  ""Overall, the removal of preclearance did not decrease Black turnout,"" says Kyle Raze, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Oregon, who authored the study. ""If anything, the removal of preclearance increased Black turnout in some states during the 2016 election."" Political scientists have found laws that make voting more difficult don't always succeed in changing election outcomes, because voters and parties take steps to counteract what's happening. McDonald, whose group coined ""Souls to the Polls,"" doesn't need a study to show him how resilient Black voters can be. He cites how Black voters reacted to another form of voter restrictions last year. The Black community in Georgia was hit hard by the Covid-19 epidemic, but Black voters still showed up in record numbers in November's election to turn Georgia blue. McDonald says what's happening in Georgia is part of a battle the Black church has been fighting for centuries -- mobilizing Black people to fight for their equality. ""We endured slavery, Jim Crow and lynching by being creative and strategic,"" he says. ""We're going to use their own tools and throw them back at them. We have to beat them at their own game."" "
politico|" Republicans in the Georgia legislature have passed a sweeping elections law that would add an ID requirement to absentee ballots, shorten runoffs in the state after two high-profile Republican losses and strip the secretary of state off of the state election board. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed it shortly after it passed out of the legislature on Thursday. “Georgia will take another step toward ensuring our elections are secure, accessible and fair,” Kemp said Thursday, shortly after signing the bill into law. Democrats, who are in the minority in both chambers of the state legislature, railed against the bill and promised immediate lawsuits. The battle over voter access has been under an intense spotlight in Georgia. After his loss in the state in 2020, former President Donald Trump spread conspiracy theories about the election. Republican supporters of the former president latched on to his claims and sought to change election laws in Georgia and elsewhere in the name of election security, but the bills often would result in making it harder to vote. Republican lawmakers in Georgia proposed some additional measures that would have drastically reduced access to the polls, which included rolling back no-excuse absentee voting and restricting Sunday voting, which is popular among Black voters during “Souls to the Polls” events. Neither of those measures were ultimately included in the package set for Kemp’s desk. Georgia is the latest state to pass a sweeping elections package. In Iowa, Republicans passed a law that tightens the receipt window for absentee ballots, cuts the early in-person voting period from 29 days down to 20 and shaves off an hour of in-person voting on Election Day. Gov. Kim Reynolds signed that into law earlier this month. Rep. Nikema Williams, who chairs the state Democratic Party, called the law ""flagrantly racist"" and a ""a slap in the face to Georgia’s civil rights legacy."" The governor ""and the GOP are now trying to outright silence Georgia voters by making it harder to cast a ballot and letting partisan actors take over local elections,"" she said in a statement. Though Republicans considered ending Sunday voting, the Georgia law does, however, ultimately expand in-person weekend voting. The law requires two days of Saturday early voting and gives the option of two Sunday voting days. Many smaller counties in the state do not currently offer that much in the way of weekend voting. The law also adds an ID requirement to the process for requesting an absentee ballot, after previously only requiring voters to sign an application. It also narrows the time window during which ballots can be requested. It also restricts the use of drop boxes in the state, mandating that each county have at least one drop box but then limiting any additional drop box totaling the “lesser of either one drop box for every 100,000 active registered voters in the county or the number of advance voting locations in the county.” The law also requires that the drop boxes be located either at the office of the board of registrars or ballot clerk or inside early voting locations — and that they are closed when early voting isn’t being conducted. It also bans the practice of “line warming,” which is providing people in voting lines food or drinks. During the Georgia primaries, voters waited in lines for many hours in some parts of the state, especially in and around Atlanta. Those lines were largely not replicated for the general election. There can still be “self-service water from an unattended receptacle” available to voters waiting in line. Democrats and voting rights advocates have been deeply critical of the bill, saying that it restricts voters’ access to the polls and puts power over the elections into the hands of the legislature. Kemp's remarks after the bill signing were disrupted as a number of protesters gathered outside his office, including Democratic state Reps. Park Cannon and Erica Thomas. ""What's the problem?"" he asked, shortly before a livestream of the event ended. Videos posted on social media showed police officers arresting Cannon after she knocked on the door to Kemp's office, because she wanted to witness the signing of the bill, a protester said. As officers escorted Cannon away, protesters demanded that the officers cite the reason for her arrest. ""You arrested a sitting state representative for nothing,"" Thomas shouted at the officers. ""She didn’t do anything but knock on the governor’s door. I'm done. I’m so done."" The law “hurts voters of color, increases taxes on struggling families & steals power from local governments,” former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams tweeted earlier in the day. Marc Elias, a prominent Democratic attorney who led many of the election-related lawsuits in 2020, promised a lawsuit challenging the law. ""Tonight, you know, we are filing a lawsuit, on behalf of the New Georgia Project, Black Voters Matter, and Rise, a student organization, because we know that these laws are all aimed at disenfranchising black voters and also young voters,"" Elias said Thursday evening on MSNBC. Republicans defended the law under the banner of “election integrity.” A preamble to the law says that “many electors [are] concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud” — despite no evidence of that taking place — and voter suppression. The bill also targets the power of the secretary of state and local elections boards. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, was targeted by Trump and many Republicans in the state because he did not support Trump’s election fraud claims. The law removes the secretary of state as the chair of the state election board, making the position instead elected by the state General Assembly. This, effectively, turns the five-person board over to the state legislature, with the chair elected by both chambers and one member each appointed by each chamber. The law also gives the state election board the ability to suspend county election officials, who are replaced by an individual picked by the board. Raffensperger is facing a primary challenge from Trump-endorsed Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.), who has boosted the former president’s false narrative about the 2020 election. The law also shortens the runoff period in the state, after Republicans suffered a pair of high-profile losses earlier this year. Then-Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler both finished ahead of their Democratic challengers in November, but now-Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock won the runoffs in January. The law shortens the runoff period from nine weeks to four weeks. That would shorten the early voting period in the state and give voters less time to mail their ballots back. It would also end all-party primaries for special elections. Benjamin Din and Nick Niedzwiadek contributed to this report."
politico|" Major League Baseball is moving its All-Star Game out of Atlanta after Georgia enacted new voting restrictions last week, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred announced in a statement Friday. ""Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box,” Manfred wrote in the statement. “Over the last week, we have engaged in thoughtful conversations with Clubs, former and current players, the Players Association, and The Players Alliance, among others, to listen to their views. I have decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year’s All-Star Game and MLB Draft.” Manfred said that MLB is finalizing a new location for the ""Midsummer Classic,"" which ""will be announced shortly."" The game was scheduled to be played at the home of the Atlanta Braves, Truist Park, in Cobb County. The Braves said in a statement Friday that the organization is ""deeply disappointed"" in MLB's move, saying businesses, employees and fans are “victims” of the change. “This was neither our decision, nor our recommendation, and we are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city,” the team wrote in the statement. “The Braves organization will continue to stress the importance of equal voting opportunities and we had hoped our city could use this event as a platform to enhance the discussion.” Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp lashed out at MLB for the decision in a statement, calling the decision ""cancel culture."" “Today, Major League Baseball caved to fear, political opportunism, and liberal lies,"" Kemp said in the statement. ""This attack on our state is the direct result of repeated lies from Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams."" MLB is also moving its draft, scheduled for July, out of Atlanta, Manfred said in the statement. The move comes after President Joe Biden backed moving the game out of Atlanta over the new voting law, which adds a new ID requirement for voters wanting to cast their ballot absentee, shortens the runoff length and in effect hands the election board to the Legislature, among other things. The new law, passed by a Republican-controlled state legislature, came after two Democrats won Senate runoff races that gave Democrats control of the chamber. Moving an All-Star Game over legislation is not completely unprecedented, with the NBA pulling its 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte in 2016 after North Carolina passed a law barring anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people. Previously, some officials and advocates had also called for MLB to move its 2011 All-Star Game from Arizona over a strict new immigration law, but the game ultimately went forward in Phoenix. Biden had called the new Georgia law ""Jim Crow on steroids” in calling for the game to be moved. Kemp, a Republican, called Biden’s push to move the All-Star Game “ridiculous.” Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) blamed the Georgia GOP for the MLB decision, calling the new law an ""egregious and immoral assault on voting rights"" that has ""put our state's economy at grave risk."" ""The leadership of Georgia’s Republican Party is out of control and Georgia is hemorrhaging business and jobs because of their disastrous new Jim Crow voting law,"" he said in a statement. MLB's move also came after pushback from a large group of voices, some of which have called for the Masters golf tournament to move from Augusta, Ga., and for boycotts of Georgia-based companies which hadn't come out against the new law. Kemp has gotten pushback over the new law he signed from major Atlanta-based companies, including Delta Airlines and Coca-Cola. On Thursday, he said in a Fox News interview that he wouldn't give into pressure, saying companies won't back down because of pressure from activists. “There is nothing I can do about that,” Kemp said. “But I’m also not running a public corporation. They'll have to answer to their shareholders. There is a lot of people that work for them and have done business with them that are very upset.” The blowback to MLB’s change of plans wasn’t limited to the Braves, or even Republicans. Former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams also said she was “disappointed” in the move. “Disappointed @MLB will move the All-Star Game, but proud of their stance on voting rights,” Abrams wrote in a tweet. “GA GOP traded economic opportunity for suppression. On behalf of PoC targeted by #SB202 to lose votes + now wages, I urge events & productions to come & speak out or stay & fight.”

On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) said in a tweet that he had told his staff to draft legislation that would take away MLB’s antitrust exception. “Any organization that abuses its power to oppose secure elections deserves increased scrutiny under the law,” Duncan wrote. Republicans in and outside of Georgia have backed the law or similar legislation, citing “election integrity” concerns despite no evidence of widespread voter fraud. Other GOP lawmakers signaled support for Duncan's proposal on Friday, including Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who said he would co-sponsor the potential legislation. In response to Duncan's post, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) questioned MLB's antitrust immunity. ""It’s time for the federal government to stop granting special privileges to specific, favored corporations—especially those that punish their political opponents,"" Lee wrote on Twitter. Former President Donald Trump also weighed in, claiming the MLB was making the move because it was ""afraid of the Radical Left Democrats."" ""Boycott baseball and all of the woke companies that are interfering with Free and Fair Elections. Are you listening Coke, Delta, and all!"" he said in a statement. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, suggested MLB should move the game to California, which is home to several MLB franchises. “In California we actually work to expand voter access — not prevent it,” Newsom wrote in a tweet Friday afternoon. Nick Niedzwiadek and Benjamin Din contributed to this report."
politico|" Sen. Raphael Warnock on Friday lamented a suite of voting restrictions signed into law the night before in Georgia. Republicans in the increasingly competitive state pushed through a law that imposes an ID requirement on absentee ballot requests, limits use of ballot drop boxes and shrinks the period for runoff contests, among other major changes. “What the state Legislature did yesterday is to try to arrest the voices and the votes of the people,” Warnock, a Democrat, said at an event in Atlanta. A proposal to discontinue Sunday early voting — a popular option among Black voters for church-based “Souls to the Polls” events — was one of the most contentious changes considered in the statehouse, but the package signed by Gov. Brian Kemp on Thursday instead ended up increasing in-person weekend voting. Republicans, in Georgia and elsewhere, have framed the push to clamp down on voting laws as promoting “election integrity” and addressing concerns about “rampant voter fraud” — despite a dearth of evidence that it is a pervasive problem. “You are literally going to make public policy based on a lie, based on the feeling that some people have that things didn't turn out the way they should have turned out?” Warnock said. “Is that how we make public policy?” Democrats and many voting rights organizations have lined up in opposition to the Georgia law and other Republican-backed restrictions moving apace across the country. President Joe Biden doubled down on calling these strictures ""un-American"" and ""Jim Crow in the 21st Century"" in a statement Friday afternoon. ""This law, like so many others being pursued by Republicans in statehouses across the country is a blatant attack on the Constitution and good conscience,"" Biden said. Warnock, who along with fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff, knocked off a Republican incumbent senator in a January runoff that followed former President Donald Trump’s loss to Joe Biden in the state. Warnock linked those victories to the recently passed $1.9 trillion stimulus deal that was negotiated and passed along partisan lines, and reiterated his calls for the Senate to pass legislation to increase voting access — and to alter the filibuster if need be. “The issue of voting rights is about the democracy itself,” he said. “It's much bigger than any Senate rule.” Democratic state Rep. Park Cannon was arrested after she was among a group of protesters gathered outside the governor’s office as Kemp signed the bill into law. Video footage captured her knocking on the door and then being arrested and forcibly removed from outside the governor's office. Warnock, a pastor, said that Cannon is a member of his congregation and that he visited her Thursday night while she was being held. “All of us owe her a debt of gratitude in a real sense for standing up,” he said."
politico|" House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn said Sunday that Georgia’s new voting restrictions are similar to the nation's infamous Jim Crow laws. “Just look through it and look throughout history, and you will know that what is taking place today is a new Jim Crow, just that simple,” Clyburn told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” The new law in Georgia — which has erupted into a legal and moral battle over the past few weeks — adds an ID requirement to absentee ballots, shortens runoffs in the state and strips away some of the secretary of state’s power, among other things. GOP supporters of the new restrictions claim they will hold up election integrity, despite a lack of evidence of any widespread voter fraud. But for critics of the law, it is the epitome of voter suppression. President Joe Biden is among those vehemently opposed to the restrictions, calling the law shortly after it was passed an “atrocity” and referring to it as “Jim Crow in the 21st century.” Clyburn echoed Biden's sentiments on Sunday. When asked by Tapper if he sees the Georgia law as the ""new Jim Crow,"" Clyburn responded: ""Yes, I do, no question about it."" The South Carolina Democrat added that it's important to not just look at the language of the law, but to also ""look at the impact of what they do."" Supporters of the bill, including Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp — who signed it into law last month — have defended it by comparing it to other voting laws across the country, even in blue states, and saying it would expand voting access in some ways, such as by guaranteeing a minimum number of drop boxes. But even though the language of the law doesn't explicitly impose restrictions on a particular group of voters, certain provisions — such as adding new voter ID requirements — are likely to disproportionately affect minority voters. Clyburn drew a comparison between the law and restrictions instated in the 1800s when Black people coming out of slavery were prevented from voting because they weren't property owners. ""They were denied the right to vote because they didn't own property. And then they went from that to having disqualifiers,"" Clyburn said. ""And they picked those offenses that were more apt to be committed by people of color to disqualify voters than they did for people who were not people of color."""
politico|" Sen. Lindsey Graham on Sunday accused President Joe Biden of playing the “race card” by slamming Republican efforts to suppress voting across the country. In an interview with ""Fox News Sunday,"" the South Carolina Republican was asked to react to new measures being pushed by his party in states like Georgia to restrict access to voting, which Biden referred to as “sick” and “Jim Crow in the 21st century” during his first news conference Thursday. ""You know what's sick is that the president of the United States played the race card continuously in such a hypocritical way,” Graham said to Fox News’ Chris Wallace. Graham went on to disparage Democrats and a package of election and government reforms, known as H.R. 1, that passed the House earlier this month and which seeks to counter Republican efforts to stymie voting, calling the sweeping legislation “the biggest power grab in the history of our country.” It awaits action in the Senate. “Every time a Republican does anything, we’re a racist. If you’re a white conservative, you’re a racist. If you’re a Black Republican, you’re either a prop or Uncle Tom,” Graham said. Democrats “use the racism card to advance a liberal agenda, and we’re tired of it. H.R. 1 is sick, not what they’re doing in Georgia.” Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed into law Thursday new legislation that includes a number of major changes in the state’s voting system, including imposing an ID requirement on absentee ballot requests, limiting the use of ballot drop boxes and shrinking the period for runoff contests. Graham said that while he supported the law, he disagreed with some parts of it, namely a provision that would make it illegal to hand out food and water to people waiting in line to vote. “That doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me,” he said."
politico| President Donald Trump’s political operation is expanding its legal effort to stop Democrats from overhauling voting laws in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Republican National Committee and Trump reelection campaign are doubling their legal budget to $20 million as litigation spreads to an array of battleground states. With the virus likely to complicate in-person balloting in November, Democrats have been pushing to substantially ease remote voting restrictions — something the Trump campaign and RNC are aggressively fighting in the courts. Trump, who has long been fixated on voter fraud, has taken a personal interest in the project. He is expected to discuss the legal maneuvering during a meeting with his political team Thursday. The battle over voting laws — specifically Democrats' efforts to make it easier for people to vote remotely during the pandemic — has emerged as a key front in the general election showdown between the parties. More than two dozen Republican operatives are focusing on the legal battles and have been closely coordinating with party officials at the state and local levels. The Trump campaign and RNC recently intervened in Nevada, where Democrats are pushing for the state to ease restrictions by mailing ballots to all registered voters. Republicans have also been active in New Mexico, where they fought back a similar Democratic-led lawsuit. The legal skirmishing has also been taking place in such battlegrounds as Pennsylvania and Georgia. While Republicans say they are open to some changes amid the pandemic, they are opposed to many of the farther-reaching reforms Democrats are pursuing. “We will not stand idly by while Democrats try to sue their way to victory in 2020,” said RNC chief of staff Richard Walters. “Democrats may be using the coronavirus as an excuse to strip away important election safeguards, but the American people continue to support commonsense protections that defend the integrity of our democratic processes.” The RNC and Trump campaign initially announced in February that they would direct $10 million to legal fights. But the party, Walters said, is prepared to sue Democrats “into oblivion and spend whatever is necessary.” Democrats have long pushed to ease voting restrictions. Marc Elias, a prominent election law attorney who is leading the party’s effort, said Democrats were currently focused on litigation in more than a dozen states, including Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. Many of the lawsuits, he said, involve expanding vote-by-mail rules. He acknowledged, however, that the Republican Party’s massive investment is a hurdle. “We’re not unrealistic about the fight that is ahead,” Elias said. “There is no question that Donald Trump and the Republican Party have made opposing voting rights a top priority for their campaign.” Republicans insist public opinion is on their side. Earlier this month, the RNC commissioned a survey finding that nearly two-thirds of voters believed there was fraud in elections and that a majority thought fraud occurs more frequently when ballots are cast by mail.
politico| President Joe Biden expressed outrage at the GOP-driven effort in many states to implement new constraints on voting access in the aftermath of the 2020 election. “What I’m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is,” Biden said at his first formal news conference. “It's sick. It's sick.” The concerted effort is supported by top Republican lawmakers — including former President Donald Trump — as well as outside conservative groups, some of whom have assisted in drafting model legislative language that has been ported over from state to state. Enacting such legislation has been one of the overriding priorities of Republican-controlled statehouses in the months since Trump’s defeat and a pair of high-profile losses by Republican incumbents in Georgia's Senate runoffs. The proposals, some of which have already cleared their respective legislatures, have outraged voting rights groups and Democrats. Biden claimed that even some Republicans “find this despicable,” and said that the crackdown on voting rules “is the most pernicious thing.” “This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle,” Biden said, referring to laws imposed to suppress Black Americans. “This is gigantic what they're trying to do, and it cannot be sustained.” Biden vowed to do “everything in my power” to block such restrictions, though he specifically held back on what that would entail. “I'm not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world,” he told a reporter.
politico|" Federal judges in Georgia rejected a pair of Republican-led lawsuits to restrict absentee voting ahead of next month's Senate runoffs — the first salvos in a GOP effort to change voting rules for future elections following President Donald Trump’s loss in 2020. Republicans filed three lawsuits — two in federal court, one in state court — in Georgia ahead of the Jan. 5 runoffs, in which hundreds of thousands of people have already voted by mail or in person for races that will decide control of the Senate in 2021. The suits primarily target the use of drop-boxes to return absentee ballots, as well as aiming to raise the threshold for signature verifiers to accept absentee ballots. The suits, which are backed by a combination of local, state and national Republican Party organizations, are an attempt to make successfully voting by mail harder in Georgia, which Republicans say is necessary to protect the security of the elections — and others claim is an attempt to suppress votes for Democratic candidates. The GOP's legal campaign suffered setbacks on Thursday, when a pair of district judges dismissed the two federal suits from the bench, ruling that the Republican plaintiffs lacked standing. But the legal efforts are likely just the start of a yearlong push by state Republicans to tighten voting rules in response to the 2020 election, which prompted unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud from Trump, his supporters and other GOP leaders who are convinced that the contest wasn’t fair. Republican lawmakers in Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania, among others, have already announced their intention to seek changes to state election laws next year in response to perceived irregularities. And Trump’s opposition to mail voting in 2020 — coupled with the way those late-counted ballots broke against him in some key states — has destroyed the decades-long bipartisan consensus on expanding the practice. Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, the two Republican candidates in the Georgia runoffs, said in a joint statement last week that their lawsuit was aimed at ""reasonable and actionable steps we can take immediately to further ensure the integrity and accuracy of our January 5 elections."" So far, more than 378,000 voters have returned votes via absentee ballot, and more than 846,000 absentee ballots have been mailed out to voters but have yet to be returned. That’s slightly fewer than at the same point in the general election, though large numbers of people have voted early in person since voting sites opened this week. Democrats have continued to highlight absentee ballots, and the state Democratic Party has already begun canvassing efforts to help educate voters on the absentee process and curing ballots. Georgia has been a center of protest on the right since the Nov. 3 general election, after President-elect Joe Biden narrowly defeated Trump in the state. Trump has relentlessly attacked election systems and officials across the country since his loss, but he has reserved special attention for Georgia, swiping at Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, two Republicans whom Trump endorsed in 2018, for not backing his fraud claims. Earlier this week, the president retweeted Lin Wood — an attorney who has promulgated some of the wildest conspiracies with the election — calling for Kemp and Raffensperger to be jailed. Loeffler and Perdue have broadly embraced the president’s rhetoric on the election, supporting a lawsuit the U.S. Supreme Court rejected that sought to effectively disenfranchise every voter in the state by tossing out the state’s presidential election results. The pair has also joined Trump in attacking Raffensperger, parroting unsubstantiated allegations of irregularities in the state. But the senators took a different tack in a lawsuit they joined alongside the state GOP and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, commending state officials’ efforts while seeking to tighten their rules. “Georgia election officials, from the state level to the local level, have undertaken significant efforts to assure the integrity of the Georgia election process in the runoff,” reads the suit. “Those efforts should be commended, and this lawsuit is brought to augment and further improve them.” In a hearing Thursday evening, Judge Eleanor Louise Ross found that the senators, state party and NRSC lacked standing and dismissed the case from the bench. “The theory of future injury is too speculative,"" said Ross, an appointee of former President Barack Obama. The suit called Georgia’s absentee ballot signature verification process “unreliable and non-transparent,” and it sought to effectively toss out a consent decree to which Raffensperger agreed in March in response to a Democratic-led lawsuit. The consent decree mandated that ballots could only be rejected if two out of three election officials consulted determined the signature on a ballot envelope doesn’t match one on record. Election officials also had to contact the voter in question in a timely manner to give them a chance to fix problems with, or “cure,” their ballot. The signature verification process has been at the center of many Georgia conspiracy theories, including ones spread by Trump, who falsely claimed the consent decree “makes it impossible to check & match signatures.” Raffensperger, who has faced threats against his family and his staff, has consistently defended the integrity of Georgia’s elections and defended the signature verification process again this week at a press conference. “Let me be clear: Before an absentee ballot is ever cast, a signature match is confirmed twice,” Raffensperger said, referencing both when an absentee ballot request form is turned in and when the ballot itself is returned. “Not once, twice. As in the signature is matched twice. I don’t know how much clearer I can make that for everyone to understand.” The GOP lawsuit sought to reverse the ratio for rejecting a ballot, asking that every ballot envelope be reviewed by three officials, and if one of the reviewers says the signature doesn’t match, the ballot would be rejected and sent through the cure process. A second federal lawsuit, filed by Republicans in one of Georgia's 14 congressional districts and would-be electors, was dismissed from the bench earlier on Thursday. It looked to block the use of drop-boxes for submitting absentee ballots, roll back signature review guidance and prevent county election administrators from opening ballots until Election Day. District Judge James Randal Hall, who sits in Augusta, Ga., and is an appointee of former President George W. Bush, said that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring their case. Even if they did, Hall said, he still would not have granted the requested relief because of the closeness of the election. ""We are not on the eve of an election. We are, as this relates to this particular election, we are closing in on halftime. Absentee ballots have already been printed and mailed, and in some cases returned,"" Hall said, dinging the Republicans for speculative claims within their suit and for waiting so long to file it. ""These plaintiffs are asking me to do what the Supreme Court, and our Eleventh Circuit, have cautioned against. ... I am not willing to go there."" A third suit filed in state court by the Republican National Committee and state Republican Party seeks to restrict the use of drop-boxes to business hours and suggests changes related to poll observers. A hearing has been scheduled for Christmas Eve. Democrats intervened in the cases to defend the procedures currently in place. “We've done a lot of litigating, and we are tired. But we are not done,” Marc Elias, a prominent Democratic lawyer who has run point on much of the party’s election litigation this cycle, said last week. On Wednesday, Elias also filed state lawsuits against four Georgia counties on behalf of the liberal group New Georgia Project, saying each county is not providing an adequate amount of early, in-person voting time. The GOP lawsuits are likely only the first step in a wave of Republican attempts to enact new rules around voting — including restricting access to mail voting, which Trump has blamed for his 2020 loss — in Georgia and elsewhere. Republicans in Georgia's state Senate said earlier this month they would seek to “reform our election laws” by requiring an excuse to vote by mail, such as being out of state on Election Day or a medical issue, which would restrict the use of absentee ballots. The majority of states currently offer no-excuse absentee voting, with no clear ideological split between states on that issue. Georgia Republicans also proposed instituting a photo ID requirement for voters using mail ballots, something Raffensperger said he supports. “The Georgia Senate Republicans have heard the calls of millions of Georgians who have raised deep and heartfelt concerns that state law has been violated and our elections process abused,” the lawmakers said in their announcement. Meanwhile, Georgia state House Speaker David Ralston called for the secretary of state to be appointed by the General Assembly and not elected by voters, which would require amending the state constitution. Individual lawmakers in other states, like Pennsylvania, have also floated rolling back mail voting. But Georgia is one of a handful of competitive battlegrounds where Republicans have unified control of state government, giving them the power to enact new laws over the objection of Democrats ahead of the 2022 elections, when Kemp, the governor, is expected to face a rematch against Democrat Stacey Abrams. Some Republicans have put their opposition to mail voting in nakedly political terms following the president’s loss. “Why is Georgia Secretary of State Raffensperger working so hard to add drop boxes and take other steps to make it harder for Republicans to win,” former House Speaker Newt Gingrich tweeted. “Is he really that intimidated by Stacey Abrams?” All the while, Republicans are also encouraging their voters to have confidence in absentee ballots in the runoff. At Trump’s rally in Valdosta earlier this month, the video screen had a message encouraging absentee requests. Vice President Mike Pence told rally goers on a separate visit to the state to have confidence in using the process. “We’re going to secure our polls. We’re going to secure our drop boxes. So get an absentee ballot and vote — and vote today,” Pence said. “Don’t wait. Fill it out, and turn it in.” Josh Gerstein contributed reporting."
politico| A Republican election lawyer who was present during President Donald Trump’s extraordinary telephone call on Saturday in which he pressed Georgia officials to “find” enough votes to overturn President-elect Joe Biden’s win in the state has resigned from the law firm where she worked for nearly two decades. The lawyer, Cleta Mitchell, 70, left her partnership position at Milwaukee-based Foley & Lardner one day after the firm issued an unusual public statement expressing concern about Mitchell’s role in the call, in which Trump importuned Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to decertify the state’s election results. “Cleta Mitchell has informed firm management of her decision to resign from Foley & Lardner effective immediately,” a firm spokesman said on Tuesday. “Ms. Mitchell concluded that her departure was in the firm’s best interests, as well as in her own personal best interests. We thank her for her contributions to the firm and wish her well.” Foley & Lardner said on Monday that lawyers there were surprised by Mitchell’s involvement in the Trump call because the firm had decided not to represent candidates in any post-election litigation. “Our policy did allow our attorneys to participate in observing election recounts and similar actions on a voluntary basis in their individual capacity as private citizens so long as they did not act as legal advisers,” the firm said in a statement. “We are aware of, and are concerned by, Ms. Mitchell’s participation in the January 2 conference call and are working to understand her involvement more thoroughly.” Mitchell did not respond to messages seeking comment. In recent years, Mitchell has maintained a practice representing candidates and campaigns in the conservative and populist wings of the Republican Party, including figures such as former Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Senate candidate Christine O’Donnell of Delaware. Mitchell served as a Democrat in the Oklahoma House in the 1970s and 1980s before dropping her party affiliation with the Democrats and eventually signing up as a Republican. Meanwhile, a federal judge on Tuesday ruled against a Trump-filed lawsuit that Trump officials have said prompted the Saturday phone call that Mitchell was present for involving Trump and Georgia officials. After a 90-minute hearing in Atlanta on Tuesday morning, U.S. District Court Judge Mark Cohen denied Trump’s bid to decertify the Georgia election results. In a written order issued a few hours later, Cohen said the case — filed on New Year’s Eve — came too late. The judge, an appointee of President Barack Obama, also criticized Trump for seeking to derail a challenge he’s already pursuing in state court. “Plaintiff offers no authority to support a federal court hijacking a pending state election contest case under any circumstances, and certainly not when the failure to expedite was the result of Plaintiff’s own actions,” Cohen wrote. “To interfere with the result of an election that has already concluded and has been audited and certified on multiple occasions would be unprecedented and harm the public in countless ways,” the judge added in his 28-page decision. “Granting injunctive relief here would breed confusion, undermine the public’s trust in the election, and potentially disenfranchise of millions of Georgia voters.”
usa_today| Editor's note: This column was originally published before the MLB moved the All-Star game out of Atlanta. It was updated after that decision. Boycotts work — when the target risks losing something highly valued and the pain becomes unbearable. As a Black person, a Southerner and an American, I respect and defend the right to boycott. The advancement of civil rights has relied heavily on economic boycotts. Our new restrictive voting law has brought calls to boycott Georgia corporations, and national voting rights allies with economic influence are considering avoiding Georgia entirely. While the employees and customers of Georgia corporations face new obstacles to the ballot box, the business community's response has been mixed — ranging from growing condemnation to tacit approval. Across the country, nearly 200 companies have voiced their opposition to similar bills. Unfortunately, others continue to maintain a damning silence, hoping the furor will fade with time. Be warned, though. Georgia is just one of the first in the orchestrated march of voting restrictions that Heritage Action and the Republican National Committee intend to secure in every state that will have them. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, there are191 bills that would restrict mail voting, 84 bills that would create new, more restrictive ID requirements, and three states that would make it more difficult for students to vote.  Sadly, Republicans in my home state have outperformed in the category of suppressive laws with the passage of Senate Bill 202: criminalizing handing out water, increasing unfounded challenges of voter eligibility that will no doubt lead to racial profiling and disenfranchisement, seizing power from election officials, limiting access to drop boxes, restricting provisions for mail ballots and more. The impassioned (and understandable) response to the racist, classist bill that is now the law of Georgia is to boycott in order to achieve change. Events that can bring millions of dollars to struggling families hang in the balance. Major League Baseball pulled both its All-Star Game and its draft from Georgia, which could cost our state nearly $100 million in lost revenue.  Rather than accept responsibility for their craven actions, Republican leaders blame me and others who have championed voting rights (and actually read the bill). Their faux outrage is designed to hide the fact that they prioritized making it harder for people of color to vote over the economic well-being of all Georgians. To add to the injury, the failed former president is now calling for cancellation of baseball as the national pastime. Boycotts invariably also cost jobs. To be sustainable, the pain of deprivation must be shared rather than borne by those who are least resilient. They also require a long-term commitment to action. The North Carolina boycott of 2016 didn’t stop with the election of Democrat Roy Cooper, and the venerable Montgomery Bus Boycott lasted 381 days, ending only with a Supreme Court decision.  No more Jim Crow: Fight voter suppression laws in the states. Don't let America go backward  I have no doubt that voters of color, particularly Black voters, are willing to endure the hardships of boycotts. But such monetary loss is unlikely to affect the stubborn, frightened Republicans who see voter suppression as their only way to win. Money isn’t quite as seductive as political power to these putative leaders.  Instead of a boycott, I strongly urge other events and productions to do business in Georgia and speak out against our law and similar proposals in other states. They should also intentionally hire the targets of SB 202 — young people, people of color and minimum-wage workers who want to elect leaders to fight for their economic security. I again repeat my admonition from 2019 that leaving us behind won’t save us. Bring your business to Georgia and, if you’re already here, stay and fight. Stay and vote. I appreciate the public positions taken by MLB, Coca-Cola, Delta Air Lines and hundreds of other companies. Even more can be done to help stop these bills or raise awareness. Here’s what corporations can do if they want to show they know what’s at stake:   First, publicly acknowledge the truth of what’s happening. Corporations cannot accept bills that turn horrific intent into terrible reality. Lobbying may stop the complete annihilation of long-protected rights, but the damage done by SB 202 and its companions in other states will hurt thousands upon thousands of voters. For corporations doing business in the other 46 states considering voter suppression legislation, speak out now when it might actually stop the bills from becoming law.   Second, corporations eager to prove their good faith can do so by putting their resources to good use. Rather than financing state legislators pushing these anti-democratic bills, refuse to fund their efforts. Instead, use those earmarked campaign dollars to support projects that help the poor, the elderly, students and the isolated get the identification they need to cast their ballots in 2022. In Georgia, for example, at least 200,000 people do not have the required restrictive photo ID. The so-called free ID offered in Georgia and other states is not free when the hours to access it are limited, transportation is difficult and the documents necessary are hard to locate, too expensive or unavailable. Stacey Abrams:Rewrite democracy rules to build an America that serves its people  Third, companies must stand up for voters by endorsing the federal voting rights standards included in the For the People Act (H.R. 1 and S. 1) and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act (H.R. 4). The For the People Act would ensure that Americans’ access to democracy does not depend on the state in which they live. As proposed, automatic voter registration, in-person early voting and no-excuse absentee voting would be guaranteed for voters regardless of geography. The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would restore enforcement of the historic Voting Rights Act, blocking state laws that would disenfranchise voters of color in the future. In speeches I give to young activists and seasoned advocates, I urge them to speak up, show up and stand up. We can expect no less from the economic pillars of our communities. Now is the time for American business to pick a side: Stand with your employees, customers and shareholders, or with those who will take away their voices. We are watching.

usa_today|" NEW YORK — Will Smith and director Antoine Fuqua have pulled production of their runaway slave drama “Emancipation” from Georgia over the state’s recently enacted law restricting voting access. The film is the largest and most high profile Hollywood production to depart the state since Georgia’s Republican-controlled state Legislature passed a law that introduced stiffer voter identification requirements for absentee balloting, limited drop boxes and gave the State Election Board new powers to intervene in county election offices and to remove and replace local election officials. Opponents have said the law is designed to reduce the impact of minority voters. In a joint statement, Smith and Fuqua — who are both producers on the project — said they felt compelled to move the production out of Georgia. Georgia voting law explained:Here's what to know about the state's new election rules “We cannot in good conscience provide economic support to a government that enacts regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access,” Smith and Fuqua said. “The new Georgia voting laws are reminiscent of voting impediments that were passed at the end of Reconstruction to prevent many Americans from voting.” “Emancipation” had been scheduled to begin shooting in June. Apple Studios acquired the film last year in a deal reportedly worth $130 million. Based on a true story, the film stars Smith as a slave who flees a Louisiana plantation and joins the Union Army. Hollywood’s response to the Georgia law has been closely watched because the state is a major hub of film production and boasts generous tax incentives. Some filmmakers have said they would boycott, including “Ford v. Ferrari” director James Mangold. But major studios have so far been largely quiet. In 2019, a Georgia anti-abortion law (later declared unconstitutional) prompted studios to threaten to cease production in the state. More than 40 Hollywood celebrities signed a letter sent to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and House Speaker David Ralston, saying they would urge TV and film production companies to abandon the state if a ""heartbeat"" abortion bill becomes law. Georgia:Dozens of Hollywood celebrities oppose 'heartbeat' abortion bill, vow to abandon Georgia if it becomes law"
usa_today|" State lawmakers in Georgia overhauled its existing election protocol last month with the passage of a law that includes restrictions some activists say haven't been seen since the Jim Crow era. Democrats and civil-rights groups panned the voting bill, and major Georgia-based corporations came out against the bill after it was passed. GOP state lawmakers who backed the bill and other Republicans nationwide harshly criticized the backlash, calling for boycotts of brands like Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines. Supporters have also argued the changes will restore voters' confidence in the election process and make elections more secure. But civil-rights advocates say the restrictions are aimed at voter suppression, particularly for Black voters. The election reforms came after President Joe Biden defeated former President Donald Trump by a narrow 11,779 votes in Georgia in last year's general election. Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff also won two Senate runoff elections in January, which flipped control of the U.S. Senate. Biden called the law ""un-American"" and described it as a ""blatant attack on the Constitution and good conscious."" Trump also slammed the bill, but he deemed the measure ""too weak.""   Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and likeminded Republicans have defended the law since its passage, with the governor insisting it expands access to voting.  What's actually in Georgia's new election law? Here's what you need to know about Senate Bill 202: Gov. Brian Kemp signed the bill on March 31. Certain provisions will go into effect on July 1: The law expands in-person early voting for general elections, according to The AJC. Two early-voting periods are required on a Saturday for each county, with optional voting on Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (hours may be extended to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.). In prior elections, early voting began on the fourth Monday before a primary or election and ended the Friday before an election day, according to the state's official website. For runoff elections, voting began as soon as possible before election day.  Some leaders of Georgia's Black churches say the new schedule will affect voting after church services, also known as ""souls to the polls."" The voting period for runoff elections was also shortened from nine weeks to four weeks. The law bans people aside from poll workers from soliciting votes or signatures from voters. The distribution or display of campaign materials is also restricted to 150 feet of the ""outer edge"" of a polling location or within 25 feet of a person waiting in line to vote. Offering money and gifts – including food or drink – to a voter is prohibited. In a rebuke of the proposal last month, Georgia Senate Minority Leader Gloria Butler, a Democrat, said Republican lawmakers ""want to make it a crime to bring Grandma some water while she’s waiting in line.” Voters have waited hours in long lines at polling places in recent elections,  especially in Black neighborhoods.  Poll officers are permitted to distribute materials encouraging voter participation as required by law. Officers may also make self-service water available to voters. Training provided by the political party, political body or candidate designating the poll watcher is a prerequisite for qualifying for or being appointed a poll watcher. Those responsible for designating poll watchers must attest to their training under oath. A board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk may supply one drop box for absentee by mail voters at the respective offices or inside advanced voting locations. Additional drop boxes are restricted to one per 100,000 active registered voters in a county or the number of advanced voting locations. The boxes are only accessible during advanced voting.  The number of drop boxes for Georgia's four most populous counties, Fulton, Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett, will drop from 94 in 2020 to 23 in 2022, according to The Times. Elections superintendents must report the returns of verified and accepted absentee ballots by 5 p.m. the day following an election day. In the event of a missed deadline, the State Election Board may convene to conduct an independent review. In prior elections, absentee ballots were accepted until 7 p.m. on an election day. The law allowed a week to finalize and certify the final vote count, according to the AJC. The mobile voting program was launched in Fulton County, Georgia – where Atlanta is located – near the end of 2020 in part to service voters with disabilities, according to the county's official website. The buses were also alternatives to long lines at polling locations. The new law restricts buses and ""other readily movable"" facilities to emergency use only. County superintendents may provide portable polling facilities for a given precinct at their discretion. Prior to the passing of the new law, the secretary of state served as chair of the State Election Board. The role was demoted to an ex-officio nonvoting member of the board. A new chairperson will be elected by the General Assembly. The move allows a Republican-controlled board to temporarily take over local election offices, according to NPR. Some critics also suggest the provision is an act of revenge against Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who would not abide by Trump's request to overturn the results of the presidential election, according to The New York Times.

usa_today|" TOPEKA, Kansas — Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed two Republican-backed election bills on Friday, including one that would have limited most individuals to delivering 10 ballots during each election and another that would have barred the governor, secretary of state or the courts from changing election rules.  When Republicans pushed the bills through the Legislature earlier this month, they had the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto in the Senate but was four votes short in the House on the ballot-collection bill. The election rules bill also reached large enough margins for override attempts to succeed in the Senate, but was one vote shy in the House.  The ballot-collection legislation would have made it harder for groups or people not related to voters to deliver their absentee ballots to election officials. It would have also required candidates to deliver ballots only from immediate family members, reining in practices that some Democrats and groups have used for years to help poor, elderly and disabled voters. ""Although Kansans have cast millions of ballots over the last decade, there remains no evidence of significant voter fraud in Kansas,"" the Democratic governor said in a statement. ""This bill is a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. It is designed to disenfranchise Kansans, making it difficult for them to participate in the democratic process, not to stop voter fraud."" Related:Georgia voting law explained: Here's what to know about the state's new election rules Republican lawmakers said they're protecting the integrity of the state's elections by making it less likely that ballots will go missing or get altered.  The ballot-collection bill would have also helped Republicans with a key policy goal: saving state abortion restrictions endangered by a Kansas Supreme Court decision in 2019 protecting abortion rights. GOP lawmakers were joined in efforts to revise election laws by abortion opponents who fear that abortion-rights canvassers could collect thousands of ballots to defeat a proposed anti-abortion amendment to the state constitution on the August 2022 ballot. Georgia has been ground zero in a national fight over election laws, but it also has come to states that ex-President Donald Trump won, including Florida, Iowa, Kansas and Montana. Iowa last month enacted a GOP-backed law that makes it harder to vote early, potentially disadvantaging Democrats. For subscribers:'A little bit of healing to do': Georgia Republicans look to mend after months of division The issue also is before the U.S. Supreme Court, which is considering the constitutionality of an Arizona law enacted by Republicans there in 2016 limiting who can return ballots. More than half of states, including Kansas, allow a third party, nonrelative to collect ballots and deliver them to election offices, though a dozen of those put limits on how many, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Kansans for Life, the state's most influential anti-abortion group, and the conservative Family Policy Alliance of Kansas, also backed the bill.  Republicans argue that the more ballots someone can deliver, the greater the chance that some will get lost — or deliberately altered or misplaced. While they've pointed to examples of Democratic candidates in Kansas collecting ballots, they've yet to present evidence that it led to fraudulent votes.  But some cite a North Carolina scandal that overturned a 2018 congressional election, in which a GOP operative was accused of having workers collect incomplete or blank absentee ballots. A few even point to a controversy in Democratic-led California, where Republicans faced allegations of setting up illegal ballot drop boxes.  Rep. Blake Carpenter, a Republican from Derby and a main proponent of both bills, said he thinks it won't be difficult to override Kelly's veto on the election rules bill since it was only one vote short of the required supermajority in the House. Three Republican House members were also absent for the final vote on the bill, he said. Carpenter said he also looks forward to working with Republican legislators to override Kelly's veto of the ballot-collection bill. ""The governor said that this is a problem in search of a solution, or that we don't really need this legislation,"" Carpenter said. ""However, I think that this legislation directly impacts what future elections could look like because of the issues we saw in those other elections and other states."" Democrats counter with cases of voters who don't have reliable transportation or who wait to vote until the mail might not deliver an absentee ballot on time.  The other bill Kelly vetoed would have prevented the governor from changing election laws or procedures by issuing executive orders. That bill would have also barred the secretary of state from entering into consent decrees with state and federal courts to enforce or change election rules without approval from Kansas legislators.  Some Republicans who supported the election rules measure criticized governors in other states who delayed presidential primaries due to COVID-19. Last year, Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab was questioned about whether he would call for an all-mail ballot election, an idea Schwab opposed.

usa_today|" AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — About two dozen protesters turned out near Augusta National on Saturday, objecting to Georgia's new voting law during the third round of the Masters. The group held signs that said “Let Us Vote” and “Protect Georgia Voting Rights,” drawing both jeers and cheers from motorists on busy Washington Road. One man passing by shouted an insult against Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who signed new voter restrictions into law last month. But another yelled at protesters, “C'mon, you can vote! Get out of here!” Georgia's law — which opponents say is designed to reduce the impact of minority voters by making it more difficult to cast a ballot — has drawn fire from around the country. Major League Baseball yanked this summer's All-Star Game out of Atlanta to shows its displeasure with the new statute. There were calls to take the Masters from Augusta National, but the club ignored the outcry and its chairman, on the eve of golf's first major championship in 2021, declined to take a stand on the bill. Georgia played a critical role in the last year's election, narrowly going for Joe Biden in the presidential race. He was the first Democrat to carry the state since 1992. Also, the state's two incumbent Republican senators were defeated in a runoff by Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, giving Democrats control of the U.S. Senate. Nearly 5 million Georgians cast ballots, many using absentee or early voting methods. “The last election had a record turnout,” said one of the protesters, Marla Cureton of Roswell in suburban Atlanta, who is part of a women's activist group known as No Safe Seats. “We should be celebrating this. It's a great thing.” Instead, the GOP-controlled state Legislature passed a law that supporters say is designed to improve election security following baseless allegations by former President Donald Trump that he lost Georgia because of widespread fraud. Other states around the country are considering similar laws. Among other things, the Georgia law imposes additional identification requirements for absentee voting, gives the GOP-run state elections board new powers to intervene in local election offices, and restricts the distribution of water and food to voters standing in long lines. “This bill is death by a thousand cuts,” Cureton said. “Anytime you put new restrictions on how you can vote, that's voter suppression. We should be making it easier to vote. It's the patriotic thing to do.” She said the protesters staked out a corner about a half-mile from the front gate of Augusta National to bring attention to their cause. “We have to keep awareness up,” Cureton said. ""It's important in Georgia that people understand it's not going away."""

In a March 31 conversation with USA TODAY commentary editor Jill Lawrence, he talked about the role of musicians in a pandemic and how he has shared his own music with patients, families and essential workers in need of comfort. He also shared his determination to stay positive, try to make a difference and approach life with the openness of a 'beginner's mind.'""

An April 3 letter addressed to Kevin Perry, president of the Georgia Beverage Association, from members of the the Georgia House Republican Caucus, requested the removal of all Coca-Cola products from an office suite. Eight GOP legislators signed off on the memo. Coca-Cola was one of the first Georgia-based companies to publicly condemn Senate Bill 202. Company CEO James Quincy said the law ""does not promote principles we have stood for in Georgia around broad access to voting, around voter convenience, about ensuring election integrity,” in an interview with CNBC, according to The Washington Post.

Jeff Duncan, R-S.C. announced plans to begin drafting legislation to remove MLB's federal antitrust exception. ""An overwhelming bipartisan majority of Americans support requiring an ID to vote, and any organization that abuses its power to oppose secure elections deserves increased scrutiny under the law,"" Duncan wrote in a Twitter thread. New city for game:MLB All-Star Game will be played in Denver after event pulled out of Atlanta Georgia Republicans also attempted to rescind a tax break for Delta Air Lines in a recent legislative session, but the move was thwarted by Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who never brought up the measure for a vote, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.  The new voting law instituted sweeping changes to election protocols, including ID requirements and a shortened request period for absentee ballots, a near-total ban on mobile voting buses for early voting and criminalizing offering food or drink to waiting voters.  During an April 3 press conference, Gov. Brian Kemp berated business owners who criticized the voting law, according to The AJC. ""Major League Baseball, Coca-Cola and Delta may be scared of Stacey Abrams and Joe Biden and the left, but I am not,” he said. Contributing: The Associated Press"
usa_today|" WASHINGTON — Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell denounced the opposition corporations and sports associations have expressed about a recent Georgia voting law, warning that firms should “stay out of politics."" “I found it completely discouraging to find a bunch of corporate CEOs getting in the middle of politics,” McConnell said during a Monday press conference. “My advice to the corporate CEOs of America is to stay out of politics. Don’t pick sides in these big fights.” While proponents of the law argue the changes were necessary to ensure election security, voting rights advocates argue the law will disenfranchise minority voters and lead to ""a new Jim Crow"" era in the state. More:GOP lawmakers call for boycotts, chastise companies that criticize Georgia voting law 'That was their decision':White House walks fine line on MLB moving All-Star Game out of Atlanta The bill adds additional requirements for voter identification to vote; allows counties to choose whether to allow Sunday voting; shortens the period during which a voter can request an absentee ballot; reduces the time between general and run-off elections; and bans the handing out of food and water to voters waiting in line within a certain distance of a polling location, among other reforms. The bill has also come under withering criticism from national brands, including Delta Airlines, Coca-Cola and Microsoft. On Friday, Major League Baseball announced that it will move its July 13 All-Star Game out of Atlanta over the legislation. Lawmaker:MLB decision will impact Georgia economy 'Antithetical to the gospel':Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's tweet slammed as racist in MLB backlash The Kentucky Republican's comments culminate a week of increasing Republican backlash to the mounting criticism, with GOP lawmakers in Georgia and Washington threatening retaliation to businesses who oppose their policy agenda. ""@MLB caves to pressure & moves draft & #AllStarGame out of Georgia on the same week they announce a deal with a company backed by the genocidal Communist Party of #China. Why are we still listening to these woke corporate hypocrites on taxes, regulations & anti-trust?"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. wrote in a tweet. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, attacked Delta and United Airlines over their opposition to the law, calling the latter firm ""pandering hypocrites"" who should ""just shut up."" Georgia Republicans almost passed a law at the end of their legislative session that would have stripped Delta, a major employer in the state headquartered in Atlanta, of certain tax exemptions. Other Republicans have called for boycotts of Coca-Cola products, turning to the soft drink company's rival, Pepsi Co. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said the actions by companies are regrettable but expected given the gravity of the laws' effects. ""Just as elections have consequences, so do the actions of those who are elected. Unfortunately, the removal of the @MLB All-Star game from GA is likely the 1st of many dominoes to fall, until the unnecessary barriers put in place to restrict access to the ballot box are removed,"" Bottoms wrote on Twitter. On Sunday, 70 prominent Black corporate executives, including the leaders of two Fortune 500 companies, came out in opposition of the legislation. ""As Black business leaders, we cannot sit silently in the face of this gathering threat to our nation's democratic values and allow the fundamental right of Americans to cast their votes for whomever they choose, to be trampled upon yet again,"" a joint letter released by the group reads. ""We call upon our colleagues in Corporate America to join us in taking a non-partisan stand for equality and democracy. Each of us stands ready to work with you on what can and must be done,"" the executives urged."
usa_today|" Opponents of Georgia’s election reforms have gone all out in expressing their ire. President Joe Biden groused about the law being “Jim Crow on steroids” or, confusingly, “Jim Eagle,” saying it was “sick” to restrict voting hours. But even The Washington Post felt it necessary to call out the president for that last falsehood, since the new law does nothing of the kind. From the panic on the left you’d think the 1965 Voting Rights Act had been nullified. But the hyperbole over the Georgia reforms betrays a shocking lack of historical knowledge about what real voter suppression looked like. There are no literacy tests in the new law, no grandfather clauses, no requirements to recite random parts of the Constitution, no limits on voter registration, no segregated polling places, no state-sanctioned violence, nothing of the kind. Critics of the law should spend more time studying history instead of erasing it. The saddest response has been the call to boycott Georgia, a cancel-culture move that will harm everyday Georgians and have zero impact on the law or the upcoming elections. It is especially insensitive as Georgians struggle to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rather than tearing the Peach State down, people should be finding ways to make a positive difference. In that spirit, here are nine ways to thwart the boycott: Check out TV and films made in Georgia. Georgia has been taking over media creation in recent years, and there are more than 50 productions filming in the state. Whether it’s “Archer,” “Lego Master,” “Sweet Magnolias” or the African American-themed reboot of “The Wonder Years,” you can find a Georgia-based movie or TV show to suit your tastes. Go to a baseball game. This one might seem counterintuitive, because Major League Baseball has jumped on the boycott bandwagon and yanked the 2021 All-Star Game, with the Biden administration’s blessing. The people hurt by this virtue-signaling decision by wealthy sports executives are the stadium workers, merchants, vendors and, of course, the fans. Going to a ball game, especially when the Atlanta Braves come to your city, is a way to push back against this type of elitist ego massaging — though it would also be perfectly understandable if Georgia fans deserted MLB altogether and switched to nonprofessional baseball played for the love of the game. Have an animal encounter. Georgia has a variety of options for animal lovers of all ages, like the North Georgia Wildlife Park, the Bear Hollow Zoo or Build an Ark Animal Rescue. You could also check out the Georgia Aquarium. The state is also a great place for hunting and fishing if you prefer those kinds of encounters. See Civil War sites. Georgia is home to many important sites relevant to the Civil War, such as Chickamauga, Kennesaw Mountain and Andersonville Prison. There is also the National Civil War Naval Museum and the Atlanta History Center. Learning, understand and preserving history is critical in these revisionist times, especially when echoes of those days continue to resonate in contemporary national politics. Eric and Wendy Schmidt:Why we're investing $150 million to bring biology and AI together Learn about civil rights. Georgia was a center for the 20th century struggle for racial equality and civil rights. There are many places to learn about the movement, such as the National Center for Civil and Human Rights and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park. It is important to have a deep and nuanced perspective on this important issue that you frankly will never get from the Twitter-fueled nonsense that pervades the political debate today. High flight. If you are an airplane buff, the Museum of Aviation near Robins Air Force Base is a must-see, with 85 historic Air Force aircraft and other exhibits. Also check out the National Museum of the Mighty Eighth Air Force with its stories of heroism and sacrifice in World War II. The World War II Home Front Museum is another good stop if you are interested in that era. Just don’t fly Delta Air Lines to Georgia; the company’s maladroit intrusion into the state voting law issue has led to boycott calls from conservatives and liberals alike. Jammin’ in Georgia. The state has a rich musical past and present, with everything from country to jazz to hip-hop, from R&B to the B-52s. Maybe stop by Ray Charles Plaza or enjoy bluegrass and gospel at the Woodbine Opry, or check out the state’s many upcoming music festivals. Whatever old sweet songs you like, keep Georgia on your mind. The great outdoors. In Georgia you can enjoy beaches, mountains, forests, cityscapes, all manner of outdoor activities. These might be good options for people more concerned about the lingering COVID-19 pandemic and seeking some more serious social distance. Try hiking, boating, biking,hang gliding — or just sitting on the sand watching the waves. U.S. airlines and COVID:One US airline is keeping middle seats open. Here's what science says about it. When you’ve done everything else? Finally, go see the Georgia Guidestones, also called America’s Stonehenge. This mystery monument erected anonymously in 1979 consists of massive stone slabs inscribed with 10 cryptic messages repeated in eight languages. Some say it is satanic, or part of a new-world-order conspiracy. John Cage and Yoko Ono wrote a really bad song about it. And it still makes more sense than the Georgia boycott. James S.
