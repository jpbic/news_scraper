daily_wire|"This week, at a rally in Georgia to mark his first 100 days in office, President Biden responded to leftist hecklers who chanted, ""Close private detention centers!"" ""Abolish ICE!"" by begging, ""I agree with you. I""m working on it, man. Give me another five days.""  ""Folks, you all know what they""re talking about,"" Biden added, according to Newsweek. ""There should be no private prisons, period… none, period. That""s what they""re talking about, private detention centers. They should not exist and we are working to close all of them… I promise you."" ""Not long after Biden took office, he signed an executive order aimed at closing all privately-run federal prisons,"" Newsweek added. ""Most private prisons in the U.S. were unaffected by the order because they are run at the state level. The order also did not apply to immigration detention centers, many of which continue to be run privately."" Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been attacked for years by the political Left; as recently as Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union""s National Political Director, Ronald Newman, wrote a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in which he stated, ""ICE is currently paying to maintain thousands of empty beds at enormous taxpayer expense—wasting hundreds of millions of dollars that would be better spent on alternatives to detention and other programmatic priorities. As a matter of good governance, and particularly in light of the historically low number of people in ICE detention, it is time for ICE to dramatically downscale its network of more than 200 facilities. … We urge you to announce the closure of or termination of contracts for the 39 facilities lifted in annex to this letter."" Newman previously served as ""Director of Human Rights and Refugee Protection on the National Security Council in the Obama Administration, serving under National Security Advisor Susan Rice. There, he led Administration efforts to expand the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program,"" the ACLU notes. In August 2019, Fox News reported: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) workers are facing a rapidly escalating series of threats, including protesters menacing their children and shots being fired at their offices, amid a rising tide of anti-ICE rhetoric from the left fueled by congressional Democrats, media voices and presidential hopefuls. Footage published Tuesday by Breitbart News shows protesters in Florida from groups such as Never Again Action and Black Lives Matter Alliance of Broward County threatening workers and former employees of the GEO Group, a private contractor used by ICE. The family of GEO Group""s former general counsel, John Bulfin, was threatened. One protester yelled, ""We know where all your children live throughout the country … John Bulfin you have kids in bleeped out, you have kids in bleeped out. We know everything about you and you won""t just be seeing us here."" More threats: ""We""re not actually joking. John Bulfin you go to bleeped out, you go to church on bleeped out, you live on bleeped out the road. We are not joking.""

daily_wire|"A professor at Cypress College in Southern California berated a student during a Zoom class for calling the police ""heroes."" During a communications class, Braden Ellis gave a presentation about ""cancel culture"" and why it is ""so destructive and tearing our country apart."" Ellis told The Daily Wire that during his speech, he mentioned how activists attempted to ""cancel"" the children""s show ""Paw Patrol"" in light of the anti-police sentiment stemming from the Black Lives Matter movement. Following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police, professors, activists, and journalists alike took to social media to decry why ""Paw Patrol"" was bad for reinforcing the idea that police are helpful. Ellis claims that his professor allotted a 10-minute question and answer session for students to respond to the presentation. The professor took the designated time to scold Ellis for his views. Watch:  Professor: So you brought up the police in your speech a few times. So, what is your main concern? Since, I mean, honestly … the issue is systemic. Because the whole reason we have police departments in the first place, where does it stem from? What""s our history? Going back to what another classmate was talking about, what does it stem from? It stems from people in the south wanting to capture runaway slaves. Classmate: Maybe they shouldn""t be heroes. Maybe they don""t belong on a kid""s show. Ellis: I disagree with what my classmate said … I think cops are heroes and they have to have a difficult job. But we have to — Professor: All of them? Ellis: I""d say a good majority of them. You have bad people in every business and every — Professor: A lot of police officers have committed atrocious crimes and have gotten away with it and have never been convicted of any of it. And I say it as a person that has family members who are police officers. Ellis: Yes, I understand. This is what I believe … This is not popular to say, but I do support our police. And we have bad people, and the people that do bad things should be brought to justice, I agree with that. Professor: They haven""t. Ellis: Well, I agree with you on that point of they should. Professor: So, what is your bottom line point? You""re saying police officers should be revered? Viewed as heroes? They belong on TV shows for children? Ellis: I think they are heroes in a sense because they come to your need and they come and help you. They have problems just like every other business, but we should fix that — Professor: It""s not a business. I think that""s the problem, is looking at it as a business. Because they""re actually supposed to protect and serve the people. Ellis: They do protect us. Who do we call when we""re in trouble and someone has a knife or a gun? Professor: I wouldn""t call the police. Ellis: Why wouldn""t you call the police? Professor: I don""t trust them. My life""s in more danger in their presence. Ellis: Professor, who would you call? Professor: I wouldn""t call anybody. Ellis: If someone intruded your house with a gun…would you have a gun on you? Who would you call? … Ellis: I know that it""s not popular for me to say that to you guys and people in here, but that""s what I believe about the police. Teacher: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Ellis told The Daily Wire that he was shocked to hear his teacher""s thoughts on policing in America. ""I was shocked to hear her comments about police, but I stood firm in my beliefs,"" Ellis said. ""We need to fight back against this liberal ideology spreading in our colleges and save America.""

daily_wire|"A nonprofit linked to the ""cancellation"" of Dr. Seuss""s books and Nickelodeon""s race-based special has teamed up with Google""s charity arm to create an ""anti-racist"" book list for K-12 teachers. La Jolla, California-based The Conscious Kid supports taking actions that ""disrupt racism"" in young children by promoting ""age-appropriate"" ""anti-racist"" literature. The organization""s website offers a slew of books for children and young adults including titles such as ""Woke Baby,"" ""M is for Melanin,"" and ""Hey Black Child."" The website also promotes the book ""Kamala and Maya""s Big Idea,"" a children""s book written by Meena Harris, the niece of Vice President Kamala Harris. In June, Google""s charity, Google.org, announced that it would partner with the nonprofit by curating a list of reading materials and lesson plans that support ""inclusive, anti-racist K-12 classrooms."" The tech giant said in a press release that it supports The Conscious Kid""s embrace of critical race theory — the theory that America is intrinsically and immutably racist. ""We""ve also teamed up with experts at The Conscious Kid to curate a list of teacher-facing reading materials as well as evaluation criteria to consider when bringing new resources into the classroom,"" the Google press release reads. ""The Conscious Kid""s selections are informed by intersectional race-center approaches including Critical Race Theory and Critical Race Media Literacy, which examine representation in the content, as well as the power dynamics behind the ownership, production, and creation of it."" The book guide says it was ""created with support from Google for Education"" and encourages educators to ""re-evaluate"" teaching classic books and opt for ""social justice books"" instead. ""Re-evaluate ""classic"" books or stories which can convey and reinforce outdated values and messaging of sexism, racism, anti-Semitism, ableism, or colonialism,"" the guide reads. ""Choose social justice books to help push back against embedded biases and reinforcing values of sexism, racism, or ableism."" According to the guide, books must ""counter whiteness as the norm or definition of success"" and avoid showcasing a character of color that succeeds when ""conforming to white values or norms."" So-called ""white values"" include individualism, objectivity, and a sense of urgency. The Conscious Kid sends ""anti-racist"" books to teachers for free for use in classrooms. ""If you are an educator, administrator, school counselor, or librarian at a Title I elementary school, you are eligible to apply to receive a set of these books for free,"" its website says, noting that ""Within 8 hours of launching this application, over 3,000 educators in all 50 states applied to receive anti-racist children""s books for their schools. We will be sending books to all of them."" On the nonprofit""s website, it thanks jewelry designer Kendra Scott for donating $20,000 to launch the fund to donate ""anti-racist"" books to schools and libraries. The nonprofit also boasts that it sent over $1.3 million in COVID-19 ""rent relief"" to families across the country, $700,000 of which went to black families and $50,000 of which went to the ""Black Trans community."" Large donors included actress Kristen Bell and journalist turned progressive activist Mona Chalabi. In the four years preceding July 2018, the most recent period covered in tax filings, it told the Internal Revenue Service it had less than $50,000 in revenue. Google.org""s partnership with The Conscious Kid is part of its broader campaign to ""amplify diversity in public education."" It donated $5 million to DonorsChoose, a platform that teachers can use to crowdsource funds for classroom projects, and $1 million to #ISeeMe, an initiative that highlights projects submitted by black and ""Latinx"" teachers. Other companies and publications such as Nickelodeon, School Library Journal, and Learning for Justice — the education arm of the left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) — have worked with The Conscious Kid in some capacity. The Conscious Kid was co-founded by Katie Ishizuka and Ramón Stephens. Ishizuka is the Editor-in-Chief of the School Library Journal, the largest reviewer of child and young adult literature and content. Stephens is a Ph.D. candidate in education studies at the University of California-San Diego. The duo is best known for their study that claimed the beloved author Dr. Seuss""s children""s literature is rife with ""orientalism, anti-blackness, and white supremacy."" The study surveyed 50 Dr. Seuss books and concluded that there is not enough diversity in the children""s books, many of which were written in the 1950s and feature cartoon characters with green skin. On March 2, which is Dr. Seuss""s birthday and ""National Read Across America Day,"" the publisher of Dr. Seuss""s literature announced that it would stop selling six titles, citing racist and insensitive imagery. In celebration of that day, in place of Dr. Seuss, The Conscious Kid hosted Douglas Emhoff, the husband of Kamala Harris, to read ""I Dissent: Ruth Bader Ginsburg Makes Her Mark."" The Conscious Kid expanded its audience even more when, in June, it partnered with Nickelodeon for a children""s special entitled ""Kids, Race, and Unity."" According to a Nickelodeon press release, the special featured the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement and Ibram X. Kendi. The special also highlighted ""teen activists who are fighting racial injustice."" ""A discussion guide as well as anti-racism resources, made in partnership with The Conscious Kid and Dr. George James, will be available on nickhelps.com and Nickelodeon""s social channels following the premiere of the special,"" Nickelodeon said. The Conscious Kid also operates a subscription-based Patreon channel for parents to help them better navigate the ""intersections of race, equity, parenting, and education."" The monthly subscription fee goes towards compensating ""educators or color for our time, labor, and experiential knowledge,"" the organization""s social media presence, and more.

daily_wire|"We should ban ""State of the Union"" addresses — including pseudo ""State of the Union"" addresses — to Congress. They are a complete waste of time, and offer nothing of any value to the American people. Firstly, they are mind-numbingly long. Biden""s first address to Congress on Wednesday night lasted one hour and four minutes. Former President Donald Trump""s addresses were one hour (2017), one hour and twenty minutes (2018), one hour and twenty-two minutes (2019), and one hour and eighteen minutes (2020). Former President Barack Obama""s addresses were a little shorter, ranging from fifty-one minutes (2009) to one hour and nine minutes (2010). Former President George W. Bush""s addresses were all under an hour, and some were even under fifty minutes. Former President Bill Clinton lasted one hour and twenty-eight minutes during his 2000 ""State of the Union"" address, and one hour and twenty-four minutes in 1995. As we scroll back through the list, the average length noticeably shrinks, with Richard Nixon""s 1972 address lasting just over twenty-eight minutes. Much of the reason for the increased speaking time is the bloviated nature of the content, with addresses of recent years increasingly dedicated to an exhaustive list of ""accomplishments."" What makes matters worse is that nearly every ""accomplishment"" triggers rambunctious applause from the president""s party, while their ideological opponents remain seated, scowling with theatrical rage. However, the fundamental problem with such addresses is that they offer nothing of value that couldn""t be provided in a lengthy Twitter thread. After all, Thomas Jefferson discontinued the practice of delivering the ""State of the Union"" address in person in 1801, regarding it as too monarchical. Until 1913, the address was handwritten, sent to Congress, and read by a clerk. It was Woodrow Wilson, one of the worst presidents in American history, who reintroduced it. In fact, Jimmy Carter was the last president to give a written message instead of a spoken address, in 1981. What makes matters worse — beyond the propagandizing and self-congratulatory nature of the speech itself — is the cynical games that are played by both sides every year. Who did and didn""t clap is suddenly breaking news. The color of clothing, and the political message portrayed as a consequence, dominates conversation. Outrageous — and often false — statements are either applauded as brave proclamations or indicative of totalitarianism, depending on political affiliation. Here""s an idea: let""s embrace Jefferson""s theory and go back to written ""State of the Union"" addresses, and we can all take back a few hours of our lives. It appears that many Americans agree, given that ""President Joe Biden""s first address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night fared relatively poorly online,"" with reactions to the speech on social media appearing to be overwhelmingly negative. Not only that, Biden""s viewership was lower than that of Trump. Let""s follow a general rule. If hour-long political speeches add nothing to the political conversation, then let""s banish them from our screens. To tell the truth, this might affect more than just the ""State of the Union,"" but we have to start somewhere. Ian Haworth is an Editor and Writer for The Daily Wire.

daily_wire|"According to reports, 23-year-old Dylan Shakespeare Robinson has been ordered to pay $12 million for his part in setting fire to a Minneapolis police station during the Black Lives Matter riots in May 2020. The fine must be paid after Robinson serves a four-year prison sentence, with the Minnesota man pleading guilty to a conspiracy to commit arson charge in December. Robinson""s lawyer said that ""there is no realistic chance"" his client will be able to afford the $12 million fine. ""Dylan Shakespeare Robinson, 23, was also ordered to serve two years of supervised release and pay back $12 million for damages that resulted from the May 2020 precinct fire,"" reported The Associated Press. ""A federal complaint accused Robinson of lighting a Molotov cocktail that another person threw toward the 3rd Precinct headquarters on East Lake Street. In addition, Robinson and others allegedly tore down a fence that surrounded the building,"" The Associated Press added. ""Three other people have pleaded guilty in federal court for their roles in the precinct fire and are awaiting sentencing,"" the report concluded. According to the BBC, Robinson was one of the thousands of people who engaged in weeks of protests and riots in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd, with Robinson traveling 120 miles south to the city from Brainerd, Minnesota. ""Surveillance video at the precinct shows Robinson lighting an ""incendiary device"" held by another person and later setting a fire inside the station near a first-floor stairwell, officials said,"" the BBC added. ""On the night of May 28, 2020, Mr. Robinson chose to depart from lawful protest and instead engaged in violence and destruction. The arson at the Minneapolis Police Department""s Third Precinct put lives at risk and contributed to widespread lawlessness in Minneapolis,"" said Acting U.S. Attorney Anders Folk, according to a U.S. Attorney""s Office statement. ""With today""s sentence, Mr. Robinson is held accountable for his actions."" ""ATF is committed to investigating the civil unrest arsons of 2020 that occurred throughout the Twin Cities,"" said Assistant Special Agent in Charge Jeff Reed, of the ATF St. Paul Field Division. ""Arson, being inherently violent, is a serious crime that put many of our community members at risk, and it cannot be tolerated."" ""The danger posed by the defendant, in this case, was very real,"" said Michael Paul, special agent in charge of the FBI""s Minneapolis field office. ""Today""s sentencing sends a clear message — regardless of motivation, when someone is intent on conducting a violent act that breaks federal law, the FBI and our law enforcement partners will move assertively to hold them accountable. This type of behavior puts public servants and our entire community in danger, and we simply will not let it go unaddressed."" In June 2020, it was reported that damage from fires and vandalism in Minneapolis following the Black Lives Matter riots amounted to over $55 million. One month later, Gov. Walz requested federal funding after riots were estimated to have caused $500 million in damage.

daily_wire|"Deon Joseph, a well-known Los Angeles Police Department officer, explained during an interview on Wednesday why he wrote a letter reaching out to NBA star LeBron James after James targeted a police officer on social media, saying he hopes to change James"" mind about the police because continuing to demonize law enforcement ends up hurting minority communities over time. Joseph said that he used to view the police the same way that James did because of the music that he listened to, an activist group he joined when he was young, and prior negative encounters that he had with law enforcement. ""You know, I""m tired of vitriol. I""m tired of the demagoguery against police officers and it""s so broad and it""s also dangerous because as that""s happening, we have political figures who are buying off on it,"" Joseph said. ""You know, I don""t mind Joe on the corner, on social media all day watching collages of cop hate videos is upset. But when we start hearing our politicians espousing the same rhetoric, that""s when it""s time to be concerned."" ""And what they end up doing is tire tying our hands over time, and actually hurting people of color in some of the most marginalized communities that we we signed up to serve and protect as well,"" he added. WATCH:  TRANSCRIPT: STEVE DOOCY, FOX NEWS HOST:  All right. A Los Angeles law enforcement consultant is calling foul on LeBron James"" now-deleted tweet the targeted an Ohio police officer involved in a deadly shooting. In an open letter to LeBron James, Deon Joseph invites him to sit down and have a conversation with him on the matter, writing, ""the tweet itself was the embodiment of hatred rooted in a lack of understanding of the danger of the situation. The offer is on the table LeBron, no cameras, no fanfare, just two men who care talking. This division and hatred must stop."" LeBron has yet to respond. But the ball is now in his court. And Deon Joseph, who wrote that open letter to LeBron James joins us live right now. Deon, good morning to you. DEON JOSEPH, POLICE OFFICER:  Good morning. How are you? DOOCY: I""m great. Thank you very much. Why did you write this? JOSEPH:  Well, I wrote it for several reasons. But one of the reasons is, I felt really horrible for that officer … in Ohio who had to make a really tough decision, especially with a young lady who was so young. And I said to myself, that actually could have been me four times in my career, I was almost in a deadly shooting, like literally this close. And I remember one time, it was a young man who was about 19 years old, I""m off duty. And I""m seeing people run away from this guy screaming that he had a gun, and I was this close to shooting that man. And I thought, if I would have shot that young man, everything that I""ve done in my career, to try to help the homeless, to try to put them into housing, to try to create an environment conducive to change, to bring awareness to help women in Skid Row, that would have been thrown out the window because someone like him who has so much power, so much prestige and influence, could easily turn 50 million human beings against this hard working blue collar guy who""s going to end up being the most hated man in America. So, that""s one good reason why I really wanted to step up and to start speaking up for the vast majority of decent offices just doing a tough job. DOOCY: Sure and when you look at what we know, so far, regarding that incident, in Columbus, Ohio, which prompted LeBron James to put up that tweet that got you going, and inviting him to sit down with you, had you been that police officer in the same situation, what would you have done? JOSEPH: I probably would have done the same thing. My goal is to save lives. Like I said, every morning, I pray that I never, ever, have to take a life. And once again, I feel so sorry for the family of that young lady. But unfortunately, the officer had to try to save a life in a split second … and people don""t understand how fast these things happen. They really have to understand how fast they happen. DOOCY: You told one of the foxnews.com people you said, I was LeBron James before I became a police officer. What does that mean? JOSEPH: … I was a young, African American male in society. And when I came up, I came up in the late 80s and 90s and early 90s. So that was a very violent and turbulent time. But also, it was a time of anti-police sentiment where, you know, we had the Rodney King incident … and all these other things. And all my family and friends, we kind of had to share this monolithic view that all police were inherently our enemy. They were our natural enemy. I mean, I joined the activist group in high school that all we talked about was how bad the police were and this and that, and, you know, and also, I was just bombarded at the time with Hollywood movies that depict the cops in a negative light. My favorite rap groups were NWA, Public Enemy, … they were guiding me. It""s almost like a steady indoctrination, to the thought that all police are bad enough. And also I had a couple of negative encounters with police that didn""t sit well and help me made me forget about the good contacts, because you never remember the good, you always remember the trauma. And my mind changed when I had no choice but to be a police officer. I did not want to be a cop. But once I stepped across that line, I discovered that the vast majority of police officers are just hard working decent human beings from all walks of life. And that 90% of what""s said about police officers is just not true. We""re not perfect. Yes, there""s a negative exception. But there""s an honorable rule to them that we need to talk about them as well, to get balance. DOOCY: And Deon, that exactly is why you want LeBron James, to reach out to you. You guys just sit down, no cameras, no nothing, just so that you can explain to him what goes on in your squad car and what the average police officer faces in a day because as you pointed out, there have been times in your career where you have to make a split second decision that could impact the rest of your life. JOSEPH:  Absolutely. Absolutely. That""s all I want is to humanize each other. You know, I""m tired of vitriol. I""m tired of the demagoguery against police officers and it""s so broad and it""s also dangerous because as that""s happening, we have political figures who are buying off on it. You know, I don""t mind Joe on the corner, on social media all day watching collages of cop hate videos is upset. But when we start hearing our politicians espousing the same rhetoric, that""s when it""s time to be concerned. And what they end up doing is tire tying our hands over time, and actually hurting people of color in some of the most marginalized communities that we we signed up to serve and protect as well. DOOCY: Sure, and Deon, it""s not just politicians. I""ve read reports about the Oscar cast. I didn""t watch the Oscars. But apparently there were a number of people who were talking about police and it was not favorable. JOSEPH: Yes, I heard that too. And it was disheartening, because prior to this new wave of anti police mentality, a lot of these celebrities have relationships with police officers, they knew officers, they had police officers that are security and body guards, and we would stand by and protect them at their events. And it was just unfortunate that these once again, these people who have influence, well intended, but not informed, you know, and when you don""t talk to the other side, you know, and you buy into a one sided narrative about any group, that can be dangerous, you can end up putting not just cops in danger, but also the public that we""re trying to help as well. DOOCY: Deon, I think it would be great if LeBron James took you up on your offer. And not only just sit, sit down and talk about your job and what people in uniform face, but it would be great if you could take him on a ride around, a ride along, so he could see what you do. He could interface with the people you see every day, what""s the one thing he would see that he does not know right now? JOSEPH: Well, I think he would see the relationships that we do have, you know, if you step away from the TV set, if you step away from your smart device, you""ll see that relationship I have with the community I serve, they""re like my family, you know. I""m in a pandemic, and I have to stop some homeless person from trying to kiss me on the cheek now because, you know, because I don""t want the coronavirus again. But, uh, but you know, to see that, you know, we do care about the people we serve, sometimes we don""t have time to show it. Look, when crime is high, like it""s getting right now, a police officer only has time to show you what he does. But when we""re able to work together with the community and build relationships and drive crime down, we can show who we are. Now I""ve been able to master the art of both. But I would like to work with someone like LeBron, who has some influence, who can influence all communities together, meet with police, again, to create this synergy where, you know, they understand the job we have. And also they can hear from us that we do care about them and want to make things better. We may not always agree, but there""s no hatred in our hearts towards any sector of the community. You know, it""s just some communities may be worse than others that would need our attention. But their skin is not their sin, disparity doesn""t always equal bias. You know, sometimes it""s just the data that drives us to the community. When you have 20 people getting stabbed on one block, we have to be there. And if we""re not people die.

daily_wire|"Actress Jasika Nicole (""The Good Doctor,"" ""Punky Brewster"") has pledged to no longer act in cop shows out of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. In an op-ed for Entertainment Weekly, Nicole described herself as a ""cis, queer, light-skinned Black actor"" who has been working for the better part of her adulthood ""to untie the threads of my own internalized -isms, reworking my understanding of how white supremacy and patriarchal ideals have informed my view of the world."" Though Nicole admitted she had little power in the industry, she did feel that she could exercise her power by not giving her talent to shows or characters she disagreed with, namely, cop shows. ""Last year, I prepared an audition for a television remake of a popular ""90s film in which I was being seen for the role of a police officer. The character was smart, charismatic, and unafraid — a dream role for lots of women like me in Hollywood,"" she said. ""But something about this character felt uncomfortable in a way that was new for me, it felt… false. I realized it was because the premise of the show wasn""t focused on the complicated ways that police officers abuse their power or how unconscious anti-Black bias flavors the way that Black neighborhoods are policed by mostly white police forces. Instead, it was just a story about one cop. One ""good"" cop. One cop who was intentionally being cast as a person of color."" ""By casting cops as non-white, Hollywood thinks they can avoid inconvenient discussions about racism and power, but the truth is that you don""t have to be white to uphold the tenets of white supremacy; you just have to believe in its validity,"" she continued. ""Suddenly the stakes of the role came into clear focus for me, and I couldn""t imagine willingly perpetuating a distortion such as this, supporting the narrative that cops were generally well-intentioned protectors of all citizens, only occasionally lumped in with a few ""bad apples.'"" After further going on to knock police departments as a perpetrator of white supremacy, Nicole added that she looks forward to using her talent to uplift ""the various communities I belong to, that will remind people struggling to see themselves represented in realistic and thoughtful ways that we don""t deserve to be flattened and watered down to serve someone else""s narrative of who we are."" In an op-ed for The Washington Post last year, Alyssa Rosenberg argued that police shows should be canceled entirely. ""There""s no question that it would be costly for networks and studios to walk away from the police genre entirely,"" Rosenberg wrote. ""Canceling Dick Wolf""s ""Chicago"" franchise of shows would wipe out an entire night of NBC""s prime-time programming; dropping ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" and a planned spinoff would cut even further into the lineup."" Rosenberg went on to argue how Hollywood and police departments have been collaborating on projects throughout the years, leading the industry to show police only in a positive light. ""For a century, Hollywood has been collaborating with police departments, telling stories that whitewash police shootings and valorizing an action-hero style of policing over the harder, less dramatic work of building relationships with the communities cops are meant to serve and protect,"" she writes. ""There""s a reason for that beyond a reactionary streak hiding below the industry""s surface liberalism.""

""If this country was a racist country, most of us wouldn't be here because even some people in your family came from another country. This country was made of immigrants.""

Do we have bad people? Yes, we do. Do we have bad teachers? Yes, we do. Do we have bad police people? Yes, we do,"" he stated. ""But don't blame the country for that because we have a justice system that will penalize you and punish you if you are a bad person, if you are a racist. ""Look at how much money they're sending to Black Lives Matter,"" Alvarez said. ""And people don't want to understand that these three ladies who control this company are bragging about Marxist Leninism. They're communists — they tell you that. And nobody understands what that means."" Alvarez was referring to a 2015 video where Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors bragged that she and fellow BLM co-founder Alicia Garza are ""trained Marxists."" ""Myself and Alicia in particular are trained organizers. We are trained Marxists,"" Cullors said in the 2015 interview. ""We are super-versed on, sort of, ideological theories."" Alvarez said that communism has been seeping into the American way of life for years. He pointed out how American Catholics haven't been vocal in denouncing abortion, prayer being banned in school, and Democrats passing gun control measures. ""Gun control? Every time there's a shooting, you want to have gun control,"" Alvarez proclaimed. ""You know why? Because they're afraid the only way out of this is a civil war."" ""Make sure that kids are no longer educated, they're indoctrinated. Make sure that people hate each other. Envy, hatred. Make sure that the blacks hate the whites. Make sure that the rich hate the poor. Make sure that the people who live in the city hate the people who live on the farm,"" he explained. ""It's all part of the Communist Manifesto, and Saul Alinsky points that out very, very well."" Alvarez, who is the founder and president of Sunshine Gasoline Distributors, fled Cuba for the United States in 1961. Alvarez took part in Operation Peter Pan, a covert program that transported about 14,000 Cuban children to the United States from 1960 to 1962 at the height of the Cold War. Alvarez made headlines last summer when he delivered a gripping speech at the Republican National Convention about the dangers of far-left ideologies that many progressive Democrats have advocated. ""I've seen movements like this before. I've seen ideas like this before and I'm here to tell you, we cannot let them take over our country,"" the Florida businessman said at the RNC. ""I heard the promises of Fidel Castro. And I can never forget all those who grew up around me, who looked like me, who suffered and starved and died because they believed those empty promises. They swallowed the communist poison pill. ""Those false promises — spread the wealth, free education, free health care, defund the police, trust a socialist state more than your family and your community — they don't sound radical to my ears,"" he said. ""They sound familiar. When Fidel Castro was asked if he was a communist, he said he was a Roman Catholic — he knew he had to hide the truth."" During a business roundtable last year which featured former President Donald Trump, Alvarez warned Americans about the promises of ""free stuff."" ""I remember all the promises that we hear today about free education and free health care and free land,"" Alvarez said. ""My God, no freedom. But he never said that until after he was in power, got rid of all the police, got rid of all the military — been there for the last 60 years and counting. And he destroyed each and every one who helped him."" In July, Alvarez joined Glenn Beck to warn Americans about the dangers of communism. ""This is the same old story. It doesn't change. We need to explain to people that the communist philosophy is based on the fact that the ends justify the means. The ends justify the means,"" Alvarez said on ""The Glenn Beck Program."" ""They will do whatever is necessary to accomplish their objective. If they have to tell you they're Catholics, or they have to tell you they belong to certain religions, they will. If they have to kill you, they will – they have. Just look at exactly what happened in Cuba.""

blaze|"The owner of a Cincinnati bar who banned NBA games until superstar LeBron James is ""expelled"" from the league said reaction to his ban has been ""overwhelmingly positive,"" the Cincinnati Enquirer reported.   ""The support for the position has been overwhelmingly positive and has far outweighed the negatives,"" Jay Linneman, who runs Linnie's Pub, told the paper. The paper said a gas station a few miles from Linneman's establishment placed text on an outdoor sign that reads, ""Hey LeBron, the West Side thanks you. Linnie's has never been busier."" Linneman added to the Enquirer that more customers have been coming in since his ban — but that he doesn't want the spotlight on him: ""I hope people channel the support to law enforcement and not necessarily to Linnie's Pub."" James made headlines earlier this month after he tweeted, then deleted an image purportedly of a Columbus, Ohio, police officer who fatally shot a black teenage girl, along text reading ""YOUR'E NEXT #accountability.""   However, bodycam video shows Ma'Khia Bryant was swinging a knife at others before the trigger was pulled. After Linneman's ban announcement, James responded the next day on Twitter: ""Aww Damn. I was headed there to watch our game tonight and have a drink! Welp."" James received a ton of backlash over his tweet apart from Linneman's ban: In a previous interview with the Enquirer, Linneman said he was tired of athletes who use their platforms to advocate for certain issues: ""They just need to play the game and that's it. Their opinion doesn't really matter. They're using their position to push their opinions, and that's just not right."" The Enquirer added that the contact section on Linnie's website includes a link for those who feel the need to ""use vile or threatening language"" — and it directs to a website with five searches relating to hell, including ""Will God forgive me."" In addition, the contact page shows a response box at the bottom that reads, ""In order to reduce hateful, spiteful, racist comments please answer YES in the box below if you support and appreciate the efforts of our brave men and women of law enforcement."" The bar's website further requires people to type ""yes"" to the question if they support law enforcement in order to leave any comment."
blaze|"The Department of Justice filed hate crime charges on Wednesday against three men in the shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery in February 2020.   Travis McMichael and his father, Gregory, told authorities that they suspected Arbery was involved in a robbery of a construction site in their neighborhood when they chased him down with their truck. Travis McMichael shot and killed Arbery after they fought over control of his shotgun. Black Lives Matter activists have taken up the case as an example of a racially motivated murder. The DOJ has charged the two man and a third man, William ""Roddie"" Bryan, with attempted kidnapping and interference of civil rights. Bryan got into his own truck and participated in the chase of Arbery. The DOJ also charged the McMichaels with using, carrying and brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence. The incident garnered national interest after a cellphone video of the lethal altercation was released to the media. The video was leaked by Gregory McMichael in hopes of bolstering his version of the events.   The Georgia Bureau of Investigation took up the case after the video was released and the three were arrested for Arbery's murder. The DOJ accuses the three of using force ""and threats of force to intimidate and interfere with Arbery's right to use a public street because of his race."" Attorneys for Travis McMichael responded to the indictment in a statement criticizing the DOJ for believing in a ""false narrative"" invented by the media. ""There is absolutely nothing in the indictment that identifies how this is a federal hate crime and it ignores without apology that Georgia law allows a citizen to detain a person who was committing burglaries until police arrive,"" said attorneys Bob Rubin and Jason Sheffield, according to Reuters."
blaze|"Believe it or not, residents of woke Seattle actually want more law enforcement, not less — and despite media coverage that consistently promoted last summer's ""defund the police"" movement, author James Freeman wrote in a Tuesday op-ed for the Wall Street Journal.   Freeman cited a story in the Seattle Times indicating that Seattle stood head and shoulders above other cities in terms of the popularity of the ""defund the police"" movement. But there was a shocker in Gene Balk's piece: ""So it's a little surprising that, according to a new public-safety survey of people who live or work in Seattle, confidence in the police barely changed in 2020."" Freeman noted that Balk was describing the results of the annual Seattle Public Safety Survey which ""suggests that the defunding movement never got much traction in Seattle either, outside of media and political circles."" He also noted a statement from Seattle University professor Jacqueline Helfgott — the study's principal author — that ""people are saying they want more"" not fewer police, as noted in KOMO-TV interview.   More from Balk's Seattle Times' piece: Freeman also ripped left-wing media outlets as out of touch with what city residents truly believe about police, citing a report from KOMO's Matt Markovich earlier this month: Freeman also called attention to a February KING-TV report from Eric Wilkinson that takes note of a corporation's move out of Seattle — and for reasons that will be of no surprise to anyone who's been paying attention to the city's downward slide:"
blaze|"Longtime Democratic strategist James Carville, never one to shy away from criticizing his own party, said in a recent interview that Democrats have a ""messaging problem"" that could cost them their congressional majorities in 2022.   Speaking with Vox's Sean Illing, Carville was blunt: ""Wokeness is a problem, and everyone knows it."" He explained that in his view, one of President Joe Biden's strengths is that he doesn't engage in ""faculty lounge"" politics. ""You ever get the sense that people in faculty lounges in fancy colleges use a different language than ordinary people? They come up with a word like 'Latinx' that no one else uses,"" Carville explained. ""Or they use a phrase like 'communities of color.' I don't know anyone who speaks like that. I don't know anyone who lives in a 'community of color.' I know lots of white and black and brown people and they all live in ... neighborhoods.""   He said that if Democrats want to stay in power, they need to speak to voters in a language they understand and use every day, avoiding ""jargon-y language that's unrecognizable to most people."" Carville doesn't think the Democratic Party shouldn't talk about race, but he does believe ultra-""woke"" progressivism is hurting the party's image with voters Democrats need to win over. ""It's hard to talk to anybody today — and I talk to lots of people in the Democratic Party — who doesn't say this. But they don't want to say it out loud,"" he told Vox. Asked why not, he replied, ""Because they'll get clobbered or canceled."" Carville also thinks that the Democratic Party's far-left activists are preventing the party from winning elections in rural parts of the country. ""We can't say, 'Republicans are going to call us socialists no matter what, so let's just run as out-and-out socialists.' That's not the smartest thing to do. And maybe tweeting that we should abolish the police isn't the smartest thing to do because almost f***ing no one wants to do that. ""Here's the deal: No matter how you look at the map, the only way Democrats can hold power is to build on their coalition, and that will have to include more rural white voters from across the country. Democrats are never going to win a majority of these voters. That's the reality. But the difference between getting beat 80 to 20 and 72 to 28 is all the difference in the world."" The bottom line for Carville is that woke politics almost cost the Democratic Party the 2020 election. ""We won the White House against a world-historical buffoon. And we came within 42,000 votes of losing,"" he said. ""We lost congressional seats. We didn't pick up state legislatures. So let's not have an argument about whether or not we're off-key in our messaging. We are. And we're off because there's too much jargon and there's too much esoterica and it turns people off."""
blaze|"The city council of Greensboro, North Carolina, voted unanimously to oust a construction contractor from the zoning commission after a tense exchange in which he failed to address a black professor as ""doctor,"" the Greensboro News & Record reported.   Council member Sharon Hightower last week said Tony Collins exhibited ""white privilege and entitlement. And what I saw last night at the zoning commission meeting was white privilege at its ultimate finest. It was absolutely disrespectful ... to dress down an African American female was unacceptable,"" WFMY-TV reported. Image source: YouTube screenshot Carrie Rosario is a Greensboro citizen and an associate professor of public health education at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro, the station said, adding that she holds a DrPH — a professional doctoral-level degree in public health. During the April 19 Greensboro Zoning Commission virtual meeting, Rosario introduced herself as ""Dr. Rosario"" to the commission before noting her opposition to a planned development near her home, WFMY reported.   Collins pushed back against Rosario's comments — and in doing so referred to her as ""Mrs. Rosario."" She then jumped in and said, ""It's Dr. Rosario. Thank you. sir."" But Collins persisted, again calling her ""Mrs. Rosario"" — and she corrected him again. ""Well, you know, I'm sorry,"" he replied. ""Your name on here says 'Carrie Rosario.' Hi, Carrie."" ""It's Dr. Rosario,"" she shot back. ""I wouldn't call you Tony, so please, sir, call me as I would like to be called. That's how I'm identified."" ""It doesn't really matter,"" Collins replied. ""It matters to me,"" Rosario said. ""It matters to me. And out of respect I would like you to call me by the name I'm asking you to call me by. Thank you."" ""Your screen says Carrie Rosario,"" Collins continued. ""My name is Dr. Carrie Rosario and it really speaks very negatively of you as a commissioner to be disrespectful,"" she said, according to the News & Record. ""I'm not trying to be disrespectful, but you're negotiating something that happened four years ago,"" Collins replied, according the paper. WFMY reported that Rosario corrected Collins five times, and he never referred to her as ""doctor."" Later, Rosario told the station that she introduced herself as ""doctor"" intentionally ""because as a black woman I often am dismissed in a lot of different spaces. Some of that is because I am young looking."" She added to WFMY that ""unfortunately, this is not the first microaggression I have experienced. And so like many times before, it was very frustrating. You internalize that, it wears on your body. I could feel that frustration internally building. And it hurt, that I'm in this public forum trying to do right by my neighborhood, and advocate for our needs, and our voices, and hearing him, feeling disrespected and just belittled in front of the viewers of this live broadcast."" Rosario said Collins reached out to apologize and that she accepted his apology, the station reported. ""He reached out on Wednesday morning. I didn't recognize the number. He did leave a voicemail message, sharing his apologies, and that he did resign from the commission,"" she told WFMY. ""This morning I returned the phone call to Mr. Collins. He did not pick up, but I let him know I accepted his apology, because I let him know I hold no ill will against Mr. Collins. This is an enlightening moment we can learn from."" According to the Rhino Times, Collins apologized Thursday via email to the city council. ""I understand from published reports that you voted Tuesday evening to remove me from the Greensboro Zoning Commission because of my behavior at the Zoning Commission meeting Monday evening,"" Collins wrote, the outlet said. ""I agree with you that my exchange with Dr. Rosario was out of line and accept your judgment to remove me from the commission. I have telephoned Dr. Rosario and left a message apologizing for my behavior.""' Hightower also called it ""ultimate disrespect of black people by one that is white,"" the station added. ""And he feels entitled and privileged to say and behave, whatever, with no consequences, and this is what we deal with as African Americans, I get this regularly from other folks, so I know how this feels. To have you dressed down in a public forum is an ultimate insult, and this is nothing but history repeating itself over and over. It's Jim Crow over and over."""
blaze|"So much for ""defund the police.""   Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) is proposing to increase the budget of the Los Angeles Police Department amid skyrocketing violent crime and increased vacancies within the department. According to the Los Angeles Times, Garcetti is proposing a 3% increase to the LAPD budget from $1.71 billion to $1.76 billion. That amounts to an increase of nearly $50 million. More from the Times: Still, the budget is slimmer than the one Garcetti proposed last year, which ultimately had about $150 million shaved off after the death of George Floyd ignited calls for police to be defunded. Such demands have mostly smoldered into nothingness as officials nationwide face increased crime and an officer shortage. Although Garcetti cites increased crime — murders, for example, are up more than 25% compared to last year, while shootings are up nearly 80% — as justification for an increased police budget, activists panned the Democratic mayor.   ""The mayor says 'Black Lives Matter,' but not in his own backyard,"" Minerva García said, the Guardian reported. ""The city says it's 'reimagining public safety,' but to them, that means giving more money to the police."" Melina Abdullah, a Black Lives Matter Los Angeles co-founder, similarly said, ""We have to be unabashed and unafraid to say, 'Abolish the police.'"" Los Angeles is not the only city looking to increase police budgets despite previous promises to ""reimagine policing."" Minneapolis plans to spend more on policing this year, while Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler (D) also recently requested additional funding for police as the so-called City of Roses is plagued by raging gun violence. Los Angeles County has also voted to give an additional $36 million to police, which will be split among multiple law enforcement agencies in L.A. County."
blaze|"Film director Tyler Perry is making waves in the wake of his speech at this year's Academy Awards decrying hatred — including hatred of police officers.   And some leftists are fuming bigly about it. In his acceptance speech Sunday for the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, Perry shared with the audience that his mother taught him to ""refuse hate"" and to ""refuse blanket judgment."" ""And in this time, with all of the internet and social media and algorithms and everything that wants us to think a certain way, the 24-hour news cycle, it is my hope that all of us would teach our kids, and I want to remember: Just refuse hate. Don't hate anybody,"" he said. Perry continued: ""I refuse to hate someone because they are Mexican, or because they are black or white or LGBTQ. I refuse to hate someone because they are a police officer. I refuse to hate someone because they are Asian. I would hope we would refuse hate.""   He added that he's dedicating his award to ""anyone who wants to stand in the middle. No matter what's around the walls, stand in the middle. Because that's where healing happens, that's where conversation happens, that's where change happens. It happens in the middle."" As you might guess, more than a few leftists who caught wind of Perry's words took issue with him including police among the groups of people he refuses to hate — particularly given the social climate following deaths of black men at the hands of police in Minneapolis and Brooklyn Center, Minnesota. The latter commenter presumably was referring to the words of director Trayvon Free after he won, with director Martin Desmond Roe, Best Live-Action Short for ""Two Distant Strangers,"" which is about police brutality. Free in his acceptance speech said, ""Today, the police will kill three people, and tomorrow, the police will kill three people, and the day after that, police will kill three people, because on average, the police in America every day kill three people, which amounts to about 1,000 people per year,"" Deadline reported. He added that ""those people happen to disproportionately be black people,"" the outlet said. Perry in his acceptance speech also recalled an interaction with a homeless woman some years back as he was leaving a studio he was using for production. He said he reached into his pocket to give her some money, but she said, ""Excuse me, sir, do you have any shoes?"" Perry said the woman's request ""stopped me cold because I remember being homeless and having one pair of shoes, and they were bent over at the heels."" So Perry said he brought the woman into the studio's wardrobe department, where the woman chose a pair of shoes — and then looked up with tears in her eyes. ""She said, 'Thank you, Jesus — my feet are off the ground,'"" Perry recalled her saying, adding that she also said she was concerned Perry would hate her for asking for shoes. ""I'm like, 'How can I hate you when I used to be you?'"" he shared, adding that he couldn't possibly hate her, particularly when his mother — who taught him to refuse to hate — went through so much heartache in the the Jim Crow South and during the civil rights movement."
blaze|"The Biden administration has given blanket authorization to fly LGBT pride flags at U.S. embassies and consulates around the world. The rainbow flag — a symbol of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender pride — will be permitted to fly on the same official flagpoles that fly the American flag.   The new policy was announced by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, which repeals the decision by his predecessor Mike Pompeo during former President Donald Trump's tenure at the White House. U.S. diplomatic outposts are given ""blanket written authorization ... to display the Pride flag on the external-facing flagpole, for the duration of the 2021 Pride season,"" the cable said, according to ABC News. The cable was reportedly sent out this week, a little more than a month before Pride Month is celebrated in June and only weeks before International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia on May 17. According to the cable, the Biden administration recognized that the LGBT gesture could be seen as inflammatory in certain countries.   ""The cable contained a hedge, though, saying the authorization is not a requirement and chiefs of mission who run each embassy or consulate can choose whether to fly the Pride flag or showcase other symbols connoting support for LGBTQ rights based on what is 'appropriate in light of local conditions,'"" as reported first by Foreign Policy. ""As a matter of policy, the United States does not advocate for or against same-sex marriage abroad,"" the confidential cable reportedly stated, adding that American outposts are encouraged to back ""efforts to advance the fundamental freedoms of opinion and expression, peaceful assembly, and association ... Discussions of same-sex marriage may result in backlash against LGBTQI+ communities in certain contexts hence posts should consult with local advocates on messaging and outreach on this issue."" During his confirmation hearing in January, Blinken said, ""I think the United States playing the role that it should be playing in standing up for and defending the rights of LGBTQ people is something that the (State) Department is going to take on and take on immediately,"" At the time, Blicken also promised to quickly fill the empty position of LGBTI envoy, which he declared to be ""a matter, I think, of some real urgency."" The State Department provided a comment to the New York Post on the policy reversal, ""President Biden believes that America's strength is found in its diversity. America is stronger, at home and around the world, when it is inclusive."" ""Recognizing that each country context is different, U.S. embassies and consulates develop individual plans to raise awareness of violence, human rights abuses, and discrimination targeting LGBTQI+ persons, including appropriate exterior displays,"" the statement said. The Trump administration permitted U.S. outposts to display LGBT signaling on other parts of the properties after getting permission from the State Department's Office of Management, but forbid any flags from flying on the same pole as Old Glory. In 2019, several American embassies defied the Trump administration's order and flew LGBT flags in honor of Pride Month. The U.S. embassy in South Korea hung a massive LGBT flag and Black Lives Matter flag on the facade of the building, but later removed them after orders from the State Department. In 2019, then-Vice President Mike Pence defended the adjudgment to not allow the sexuality-related flag to be flown next to the Stars and Stripes. ""As the president said on the night we were elected, we're proud to be able to serve every American,"" he told NBC News. ""We both feel that way very passionately, but when it comes to the American flagpole, and American embassies, and capitals around the world, one American flag flies."""
blaze|"The mayor of Portland extended a state of emergency for the city through this weekend in an attempt to curtail potential violence and defacement of property. The state of emergency, which gives Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler (D) power to declare a curfew and close public facilities, was first declared on Tuesday, the day of the verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial.   ""Tonight, the anarchists have called for more destruction,"" Wheeler said at a news conference on Friday afternoon. ""I've directed the police bureau to arrest and engage illegal activity whenever they can safely do so."" Wheeler also threatened anyone committing destruction in Oregon's biggest city, and declared, ""Let's make it hurt them a little bit."" In his strongest words since the regular George Floyd protests and riots began nearly a year ago, Wheeler finally said he would crack down on Antifa and black bloc extremists who have terrorized the city.   ""Our job is to unmask them, arrest them, and prosecute them,"" Wheeler said during the press conference. ""I want to personally thank neighbors, family, friends and others who have come forward with vital evidence. People know who these criminals are. They know what they're up to."" ""If you have any information, please contact the police,"" Wheeler said, as reported by the Post Millennial. ""I also want you to know that these people often arrive at their so-called direct actions, in cars. And they're all dressed in all black. If you see this, call the police. If you can provide a license plate, if you can do so safely, that information can help later. Together we can make a stand. We're doing what we can today. I'm also asking for your help to make a stand and take our city back."" ""There are ways that our other community partners and institutions can be helpful in making it crystal clear that the city of Portland will not tolerate criminal destruction or violence,"" Wheeler stated. ""Those who are engaged in it, let's make it hurt them a little bit."" Wheeler has been a pushover for the far-left rabble-rousers in Portland, who have staged a sit-in protest inside the lobby of his condo, verbally abused him at a pub, punched the mayor while he was eating dinner at a restaurant, and threw objects at him when he showed up at a protest. Despite the tough talk, yet another riot was declared in Portland on Friday night. The Portland Police Bureau noted that ""about 75 people mostly dressed in all black, or 'bloc' attire designed to make it difficult for police to identify lawbreakers."" Within the first 15 minutes of the planned ""autonomous demonstration"" there were ""reports of broken windows and graffiti"" at businesses, including a Moroccan restaurant reportedly owned by an immigrant. A TriMet bus shelter was tagged with the anarchist symbol. ""Some members of the group briefly forced their way into a tavern/restaurant in the 2200 block of Northwest Hoyt Street, then other participants followed them in and pulled them out,"" the Portland Police said. ""A resident who was taking video of the march had a rock thrown through his window."" Two people were arrested.   Last weekend, several stores in Portland were set on fire and vandalized, including large national retailers that donated millions of dollars to social justice campaigns, as well as a church that feeds the homeless."
breitbart|"The co-founder of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, Patrisse Cullors, was the protégé of a communist-supporting domestic terrorist for over a decade, spending years training in political organizing and absorbing the radical Marxist-Leninist ideology which shaped her worldview. Eric Mann, who mentored Cullors for over a decade in community organizing, was a member of radical-left militant groups: Students for a Democratic Society and the Weather Underground, which bombed government buildings and police stations in the 1960s and 1970s. In a newly resurfaced video from 2015, Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors reveals that she and her fellow BLM founders are ""trained Marxists."" In the video, Cullors is interviewed by Jared Ball of the Real News Network and discusses the direction of the BLM movement. ""The first thing, I think, is that we actually do have an ideological frame. Myself and Alicia in particular are trained organizers,"" she said. ""We are trained Marxists. We are super-versed on, sort of, ideological theories. And I think that what we really tried to do is build a movement that could be utilized by many, many black folk."" In previous interviews in 2018, while promoting her then-new book titled, ""When They Call You a Terrorist: A Black Lives Matter Memoir,"" Cullors describes her introduction to and affinity for Marxist ideology. In an interview with Democracy Now!, Cullors describes how she became a trained organizer with the Labor/Community Strategy Center, calling it her ""first political home"" and the center""s director, Eric Mann, her personal mentor. She told The Politic that it was there that she was trained from her youth and grew as a leader. The Labor/Community Strategy Center describes it""s philosophy as ""an urban experiment,"" utilizing grassroots organizing to ""focus on Black and Latino communities with deep historical ties to the long history of anti-colonial, anti-imperialist, pro-communist resistance to the U.S. empire."" The center teaches and studies the history of the ""Indigenous rebellions against the initial European genocidal invasions,"" the ""Great Slave Haitian Revolution of the 1790s,"" and the ""Great Slave Rebellions that won the U.S. civil war for the racist north."" The center also expresses its appreciation for the work of the U.S. Communist Party, ""especially Black communists,"" as well as its support for ""the great work of the Black Panther Party, the American Indian Movement, Young Lords, Brown Berets, and the great revolutionary rainbow experiments of the 1970s,"" while flaunting its roots in the new communist movement. Speaking with ACLU""s At Liberty weekly podcast, Cullors described the center as her ""foundation,"" claiming it was there that she developed the skills which helped her found the Black Lives Matter movement, after having been recruited by its director, Eric Mann. Mann, an avowed communist revolutionary, was the New England coordinator for Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in 1968. The following year, a more radical wing splintered from the SDS, led by Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn, calling for violent ""direct action"" over civil disobedience. The splintered faction became known as the Weather Underground, with the stated goal of overthrowing the U.S. government. As a result, the FBI classified the organization as a domestic terrorist group in 1969. Mann led a group of fellow Weathermen who launched their own violent direct action at the Harvard University Center for International Affairs. In an article titled: ""Band Invades, Violently Disrupts Center for International Affairs,"" the Harvard Crimson reported that a band of 20 to 30 activists invaded the Center for International Affairs, ""roughing up"" several staff members and employees before fleeing. Several slogans, including ""Pig,"" ""Fuck U.S. Imperialism,"" and ""Imperialists Screw All Women,"" were sprayed on the building""s walls. Rocks thrown by the group broke several windows and a telephone was damaged to prevent police from being notified. Undergraduates who saw the group leaving the building and chanting ""Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh; NLF is going to win,"" said they recognized some of them as members of Weathermen, a militant spin-off of the older New Left Caucus of SDS. Mann was later charged with five counts of assault and battery, disturbing the peace, damaging property, defacing a building, and disturbing a public assembly, for which he spent 18 months in prison. At the 2010 United States Social Forum in Detroit, under the slogan ""Another World Is Possible. Another U.S. Is Necessary,"" the Labor/Community Strategy Center sponsored a session titled: ""Transformative Organizing Theory: Conscious Organizers Seek to Build Anti-racist, Anti-imperialist Politics Rooted in Working Class Communities of Color."" In it, Cullors––rising to prominence––was chosen by Mann to be a panelist along with him. There, Cullors spoke about growing up as a working class, queer, Black woman, in a single-parent household, with a father who was in and out of prison. Cullors stated that ""positionality in this country is supposed to devastate us"" and had done so somewhat successfully, while stressing the need to ""fight this thing."" Both Cullors and Mann strongly endorsed Bernie Sanders. Cullors was a primary speaker at a Sanders campaign event the day before Super Tuesday, which Mann attended. Cullors, viewing Biden as far too moderate, pushed for the latter to end his campaign, accusing him of having an ""old guard mentality"" and coming from an ""old establishment."" Now with Biden leading as the Democratic presidential nominee, Cullors and Mann are finding a sympathetic ear for their radical agenda. As Breitbart news reported, a group of 50 leading national progressive groups representing millions of active members across the country, are pressuring Biden to adopt the radical platform of the Movement for Black Lives which was co-written by BLM. The group is calling for Biden to immediately incorporate their radical policies, including putting forward a transformative and comprehensive policing and criminal justice reform laid out by the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL). Citing his ""moral responsibility in this moment"" to make amends for past harms he had caused, the groups demanded that Biden make commitments such as advance reparations and defund police, prisons, and weaponry in order to fully fund healthcare, housing, education, and environmental justice. ""We ask that you revise your platform to ensure that the federal government permanently ends and ceases any further appropriation of funding to local law enforcement in any form and redirect those and additional resources towards much needed community-led and community-controlled public safety efforts,"" the letter reads.

breitbart|"Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi rebuked U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan during a meeting in Anchorage, Alaska, on Thursday, citing the Black Lives Matter movement on U.S. human rights abuses. The summit was the first bilateral meeting between the two countries under President Joe Biden, who has traditionally been soft on Beijing, and has struggled to balance a desire to break with Trump""s tough policies with the need for a strong stance. Ahead of the meeting, the White House boasted that it had successfully insisted that the summit happen on home soil. Press Secretary Jennifer Psaki also promised earlier Thursday that the U.S. would bring up concerns about human rights in China. But when Blinken spoke of the ""rules-based international order,"" and expressed ""deep concerns"" with China""s behavior in ""Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyberattacks on the United States, economic coercion toward our allies,"" Jiechi struck back. He objected to what he called a violation of diplomatic protocol, and said the U.S. could not lecture China from a position of strength.  He also claimed that the U.S. had ""deep-seated"" human rights problems:  Blinken countered that in his discussion with allies, he was hearing ""deep satisfaction that the United States is back, that we""re re-engaged with our allies and partners,"" and ""deep concern about some of the actions your government is taking."" He added that a ""hallmark"" of American ""leadership"" was that the U.S. was willing to admit its mistakes — that it was engaged in ""a constant quest to form a more perfect union,"" but confronted its challenges ""openly"" and ""transparently.""

The information was contained in a detailed 69-page Open Society report on the agenda of an Open Society U.S. Programs board meeting held in New York October 1 to October 2, 2015.

breitbart|"Breitbart News has given #BlackLivesMatter more detailed, deep, and honest coverage than any other media outlet on the planet in 2015, and for good reason. From covering every major protest they did to exposing the cop killer that the group worships to revealing the secret funder behind the movement to Milo Yiannopoulos""s complete shredding of activist Shaun King, Breitbart News has been the go-to source for original reporting on Black Lives Matter. Why is Breitbart News so on top of the Black Lives Matter movement? Easy. We saw it coming. Not everyone liked what we saw either. In August 2012, the magazine American Conservative did an article on the film Occupy Unmasked. That film was directed by Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon and featured people like Andrew Breitbart, Brandon Darby, and myself exposing the Occupy Wall Street movement for what it was — a socialist, Obama-inspired activist movement. We pointed out that Occupy was the latest incarnation of the far-left, anti-American protest movements that dates back to the 1960s"" Students for a Democratic Society and Black Panthers. We also said that the next step in the evolution of Occupy Wall Street would be race-based. American Conservative took the film to task for using the term ""race war"" to describe what we saw as the next phase of the Occupy movement. Remember, Occupy Unmasked came out about a year before three self-described queer black women started Black Lives Matter in July 2013. In 2012, Anita MonCrief was mocked by American Conservative when she defended her use of the term ""race war"" in Occupy Unmasked by saying: MonCrief said this two years before the hoodie-wearing thugs burned down Ferguson, before they looted and set fire to Baltimore, before they shut down Bernie Sanders at NetRoots nation, and before they shut down Chicago""s ""Magnificent Mile"" on the busiest shopping day of the year. The assertion that Occupy Wall Street would morph into Black Lives Matter wasn""t a lucky guess. MonCrief, Darby, and I are all former leftists with professional organizational experience. Anita was a whistleblower who worked for ACORN, Darby was a cofounder of Common Ground in New Orleans, and I did work for MoveOn.org and Brave New Films. Because we understand the tactics and the players, it was clear to us that the Occupy movement and its focus on class had failed to resonate with a large enough segment of the American people. We knew that the logical next step was to head back to the 1960s"" playbook of trying to tear down America by creating as deep a racial rift as possible. With Barack Obama in the White House and Eric Holder running the Department of Justice, the stage was set for the next iteration of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Black Lives Matter was the new Occupy. We also saw that community organizers were working on developing a new movement based on young black people in the wake of George Zimmerman""s not guilty verdict in the Trayvon Martin shooting case. As I wrote at Breitbart News in July 2013, the takeover of the Florida statehouse by the group Dream Defenders was a ""magnet for young people. The long-term goal is straightforward and explicit: the 2014 vote. Once in the Capitol, the Dream Defenders are giving the enthusiastic participants organizer training, right in the governor""s office."" With two generations of educators, media, and legal experts all schooled in New Left political correctness by America""s leading universities, the Black Lives Matter movement has been essentially immune to criticism. The result has left universities, businesses, and police departments defenseless — intellectually and physically — against Black Lives Matter. There""s been a practical cost as well. We""ve seen businesses burned to the ground in Ferguson and Baltimore. We""ve seen other businesses shut down at the Mall of America and on Chicago""s ""Magnificent Mile."" We""ve seen the murder rate spike in cities across the country as a result of the ""Ferguson Effect"" that has caused police officers to pull back from enforcing the law in the face of unrelenting hostility and scrutiny. We""ve seen universities from coast-to-coast bullied into staff firings and policy changes that were meant to only aid black students. These college uprisings have been accompanied by a fierce hatred of free speech; and when combined with the bold aggressiveness of multicultural and feminist Social Justice Warriors, they""ve created an educational environment that is openly hostile to white students and faculty. With the next presidential election only 11 months away, conservatives and Republicans would be making a huge mistake to ignore the Black Lives Matter movement. At the close of 2015, the pot is getting ready to boil over. The decision not to prosecute Cleveland police officers in the shooting death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, the ongoing anger in Minneapolis over the death of Jamar Clark, and two recent Chicago police shootings all create an atmosphere where even angier protests are in the works. Already, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and his Democrat machine regard Black Lives Matter activists as an existential threat. The engine that drives the anger is the mainstream media, which has done nothing to seriously vet the Black Lives Matter movement. Much of the anger is caused by the inaccurate reporting that consistently vilifies the police and leaves out key details about the shooting victims. This has led to fables such as ""Hands Up, Don""t Shoot,"" which have continued to be amplified and repeated by Black Lives Matter protesters long after they have been debunked. In fact, one of the key characteristics of the Black Lives Matter movement and the mainstream media""s reporting on it is a naked antipathy for facts. Both in real life and on social media like Twitter, leading Black Lives Matter activists are known for shutting down the speech of dissenting opinions and literally blocking anyone who disagrees with them. The result has been a hermetically sealed activist movement that is angry and ignorant, with a hairtrigger temper and a long list of grievances that have no factual basis. Worse, their set of crazed demands have been granted time and again by officials who are too scared to speak out for fear of being branded racists. Like spoiled children, none of this appeasement has done anything to quell the protesters"" fury. Every time that politicians or university administrators have given into the outrageous, entitled Black Lives Matter mob, they""ve learned that feeding that monster has only given it more power to make more demands. In the face of all this feckless kowtowing, no wonder the blunt and in-your-face style of billionaire Donald Trump has hit home for so many Americans. Trump – like Ronald Reagan in the 1960s – seems to be one of the few people in public life willing to tell Black Lives Matter protesters to sit down, shut up, and stop taking the loser road of self-victimization. This is one of the reasons that Donald Trump, more than any other political candidate on the scene right now, has incurred so much of the wrath and anger of Black Lives Matter. They are keenly aware that he simply will not play their game. The other current frontrunner for the Republican nomination is Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has already demonstrated that he is no cupcake either. Should either Cruz or Trump be the nominee, expect Black Lives Matter""s army to take to the streets and try to shut them down at every opportunity. For that reason, the current political season is set to be even more divisive than either of the last two election cycles, which had already set a very high bar for vitriol. As the newest incarnation of the activist Left, Black Lives Matter will not back down or rest until it is either stopped by somone gutsy enough to call them out or until it gets what it wants: a bloody revolution leading to a socialist/anarchist America. The one thing the left has not counted on, however, is a dogged, active conservative media culture that can bring real information straight to the American people without being filtered by Black Lives Matter""s journalism school comrades. We""re not about to let Black Lives Matter or any leftist revolutionary movement destroy America without making sure they""re fully revealed for what they are. In 2016, we""ll be doing here at Breitbart News what the mainstream media will never do: vetting and exposing the real Black Lives Matter movement. Stay tuned."
breitbart|"Is the Klan still around? I ask because Black Lives Matter has been so busy turning the entire American population against its own cause, you have to wonder if BLM is an astroturfed ploy of the American Nazi Party or some related anti-black organisation. You see, unrest is brewing again in Ferguson, Missouri on the one-year anniversary of the death of Michael Brown. And the Black Lives Matter movement has wasted no time proving itself petulant, hypocritical, ineffectual, and riddled with tantrum-throwing grievance-mongers, race-baiting bullies, and odious professional attention-seekers. Just look at how they are terrorising Bernie Sanders. Prior to the Ferguson lootiversary, #BlackLivesMatter was keeping itself in the news by picking on Sanders and forcing him off stage. But these yarn-haired harpies screeching at a befuddled old socialist are not, as we say in the business, ""good optics"" – particularly for the BLM movement itself. Not that I don""t love a bit of left-on-left violence, but is there a white person on earth less likely to end a black life than Bernie Sanders?  And now all the usual suspects are out in force again, tacitly – and in some cases not so tacitly – serving up excuses for murderers and thieves – the people President Obama has rightly called ""thugs."" Black Lives Matter is a confusing movement, since they seem to only care about certain black lives, while ignoring the rest. But I guess it""s more economical on Twitter to use a 16-character hashtag, as opposed to a more accurate name for the movement, such as #Black Lives Matter When Ended By Police Or Whites In A Manner That Can Be Exploited For Political And Financial Gain And No I Don""t Want To Look At Your Murder Statistics Shut Up Shut Up La La La I""m Not Listening Go Awaaaaaaay. While Black Lives Matter continues to descend into comic uselessness, there nevertheless remain many social justice topics that require vigilance and grassroots activism. Therefore please find below a list of activist groups that have come to my attention, each of them worthy of your consideration and each palpably less entitled, ridiculous, and hypocritical than Black Lives Matter. Some of them have been going for a long time; others are still nascent. But none of them is as preposterous and socially counter-productive as Black Lives Matter. BLACK WIVES MATTER
With more than 71 per cent of black children born out of wedlock, black wives are an endangered species – though you won""t hear much about this from the likes of Vox and BuzzFeed. Black moms deserve a grassroots movement to put a little pressure on baby-daddies everywhere. BLACK KNIVES MATTER
Gun crime gets all the glory, and the (black-wielded) pistol is the undisputed king of black murders. But knives deserve attention too, if only because knives are a lot less likely to take out innocent victims – an all-too-common story in warzones like Chiraq. BLACK HIVES MATTER
Honey is a key ingredient for many soul food recipes. So where is the support for the vanishingly few black beekeepers? If Black Hives Matter is anything like Black Lives Matter, they will blame the dreaded Colony Collapse Disorder on neocolonial patriarchy and break up the next Vermont Beekeepers"" Association summer BBQ with shrieking about how the Queen Bee is only large and in charge because she""s internalised so much white male misogyny. BLACK LIVES FATTER
Obesity is an American problem, but especially a black American problem. 4 out of 5 black women in the US are overweight or obese, yet the fat acceptance movement is primarily geared towards the whinging white whales of the Internet. Not any more! It""s time for fat acceptance to penetrate this new market. BLACK TRIBES MATTER
If you can put the tissues down for a second and stop bawling about a fucking lion, you ridiculous emotional retards, perhaps spare a thought for the genocides occurring every day back in the home country. Because it""s not just in America that black people are slaughtering each other by the tens of thousands. Hmm. When you think about it, black Americans are actually pretty privileged… BLACK ISRAELITES MATTER
Yes, they are completely crazy black Americans who one day decided they were descended from an ancient tribe from Israel, and yes, predictably, they are not recognised as Jewish by most Jews. But be honest. Who would you rather sit next to at Nando""s, Desmond Dekker or DeRay McKesson? BLACK LICORICE MATTERS
In the United States, black liquorice is treated as the repugnant lesser sibling of red licorice, despite the fact that red licorice covers the actual flavour of licorice with cherry, strawberry, or other artificial flavours. A bit like how white people appropriate black culture, you might say! Only Black Licorice Matters. With your non-tax-deductable contribution, you can protect black licorice""s status in the candy world. BLACK JIVE MATTERS
Stodgy academics have tried for decades to rebrand the language of black youths with euphemisms such as ""ebonics"" and ""African American Vernacular English"" but true aficionados will always recognise it as jive. This is actually the oldest organisation on the list, predating Black Lives Matter by more than 30 years, according to one documentary. BLACK RUSSIANS MATTER
This group doesn""t exist to support a race of people, but rather a mixed drink. The Black Russian combines vodka with a coffee liqueur, such as Kahlua. It is often overshadowed by its cousin the White Russian, which, indigity of indignities, adds cream to the mix. Like most black activists I secretly look down on mixed race people as somehow tainted. White Russians literally whitewash the Black Russian experience, and popularized by the film The Big Lebowski, which is horrifically triggering in its own right. BLACK EMBRYOS MATTER
Black babies are aborted in horrific numbers in the US. In fact, the most dangerous place for a black person to be in America is in the womb. At least born black children have a chance of dodging gunfire: in your mother""s stomach, you have nowhere to run. TRANS-BLACK LIVES MATTER
You knew this was coming, right? Black Lives Matter erases the experience of trans-blacks, but titans of the civil rights movement such as Rachel Dolezal, Godfrey Elfwick, and me deserve the support of the wider black community too. Remember, just because you weren""t born black doesn""t mean you have any less of a black experience or that you can""t waste police time with made-up hate crimes. BLACK DICKS MATTER
It is an incontrovertible fact that the darker the berry, the sweeter the juice, and it is time for an activist group to stand up for this cause. Expect the donor pool to include a lot of gay men and white women. (I speak from experience.) This means the coffers will be overflowing because let me tell you, us chi-chi men got dollar. BLACK SEX DRIVES MATTER
See above. BLACK HOLES MATTER
Minds out of the gutter, please! This group is focused on equal rights for black holes, the most powerful celestial bodies in the universe but viciously slandered as ""dangerous."" Yet another example of how the word ""black"" is applied to powerful and dangerous plane-swallowing entities. But expect some confusion at rallies from punters expecting this to be a sister movement – amirite?! – to Black Dicks. BLACK FRIDAY MATTERS
Black Friday is a gay holiday that enshrines our noblest tradition and most assertive genetic predisposition – maxing out the boyfriend""s AmEx – in an annual festival of consumption and regret. Known for insane deals luring shoppers out as early as midnight, the Black Friday Matters movement is a diversity initiative aimed at encouraging African-American shoppers to save money on plasma TVs and iPads instead of looting them from Walmart at the first sign of police presence. MILO""S LIFE MATTERS
Notwithstanding the many glorious contributions to our national culture made by movements such as Black Lives Matter, this group is why I won""t actually be visiting Ferguson, Baltimore, Detroit, or Oakland any time soon. Sorry, no offence, but it""s true. Follow Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero) on Twitter and Facebook. He""s a hoot! Android users can download Milo Alert! to be notified about new articles when they are published."
breitbart|"Political and corporate support for Black Lives Matter has become ubiquitous over the past week. Everyone""s email inbox is bulging with messages of support from corporate sponsors, every website is covered with Black Lives Matter logos, and the group has benefited from numerous fundraisers and charity sales. But, many people might not realize that Black Lives Matter is a distinct political organization, not just a slogan or social media hashtag, and it has both enormous funding and a wide-ranging political agenda. Founded by Radicals BLM describes its own founders as ""three radical Black organizers"" named Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi, who ""created a Black-centered political will and movement building project… in response to the acquittal of Trayvon Martin""s murderer, George Zimmerman.""  Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi — the founders of BLM (Photo source: BlackLivesMatter.com) BLM""s history page proudly salutes the radical causes built into its DNA since its 2013 founding, including ""liberation"" politics and transgenderism. In fact, BLM thinks other black civil rights movements aren""t nearly radical enough, especially when it comes to the gender politics of the hard Left: ""Black liberation movements in this country have created room, space, and leadership mostly for Black heterosexual, cisgender men – leaving women, queer and transgender people, and others either out of the movement or in the background to move the work forward with little or no recognition."" BLM incessantly refers to the deaths of Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown, and others as ""murder,"" ignoring all court decisions to the contrary, and describes police work as ""state-sanctioned violence"" against oppressed populations. In the course of explaining how it was formed, the group refers to cities like Ferguson, Missouri, as ""occupied territory"" – with law enforcement cast as a brutal invading force – and insists most other cities should be seen the same way: ""We understood Ferguson was not an aberration, but in fact, a clear point of reference for what was happening to Black communities everywhere."" Corporate and foundation sponsors appear unconcerned that BLM is unclear about who runs the movement today and commands its vast resources. The group itself claims it has no top-level leadership at all: ""The project is now a member-led global network of more than 40 chapters. Our members organize and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes."" The BLM founders are involved in a sprawling network of other left-wing groups and clearly remain influential with Black Lives Matter, although they are not held accountable as its executives. A New Yorker interview with Tometi on June 3, for example, treated her as a top BLM spokeswoman while noting that she has moved on to create and manage other organizations, most recently including an immigration activist group called the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, which is listed as a ""partner"" by Black Lives Matter. Another partner is the UndocuBlack Network, a ""multigenerational network of currently and formerly undocumented black people."" ""We have been fighting and advocating to stop a war on black lives. And that is how we see it – this is a war on black life. And people understand that this system is filled with all sorts of inequality and injustice, and that implicit bias and just outright racism is embedded in the way that policing is done in this nation – and when you think about it historically, it was founded as a slave patrol. The evolution of policing was rooted in that,"" Tometi said in her New Yorker interview. Coronavirus Hypocrisy In her interview with the New Yorker, Tometi said the coronavirus pandemic is yesterday""s news, and the disease – which is said to be far more dangerous to blacks than any other demographic in the United States – should be no obstacle to righteous activism. ""Concern about the pandemic is high, but people are also very clear that you can sit at home and also be affected by this illness, or you can go out and fight for a chance to live a life full of dignity, and they are willing to risk it. I think we have to sit with the profundity of this moment, and what it really means for people to say, ""You know what, we are in this health crisis yet I cannot stay in my house. There is too much at stake. I am going to make an informed decision, and I am going out against all odds because it is worth it and the status quo is intolerable,'"" she said.  Protesters stretch for blocks during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd near the White House on June 6, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images) This has become a common sentiment on the Left: the infections and deaths that could result from mass protests are less important than the BLM cause. BLM actually has a section about the coronavirus on its website, and it makes absolutely no mention of lockdowns, social distancing, or any of the other draconian measures that have been imposed on the American people since March. Instead, BLM quite accurately predicted that the pandemic could result in ""result in massive social, economic, and political upheaval as systems reach crisis points and begin to fracture."" This is BLM""s six-point strategy for dealing with the coronavirus: SNAP is better known as the food stamp program. None of these measures has anything to do with disease prevention or restarting the economy after a lockdown, and would become vastly more expensive if the massive BLM protests produce another wave of coronavirus infections and deaths, followed by another lockdown order. The first positive COVID-19 tests for people who participated in the protests and riots are beginning to come in. BLM Funding As the Washington Times noted in 2016, Black Lives Matter (BLM) presents itself as a plucky street-level movement with shoestring resources, but in truth it receives millions of dollars from corporate and political sponsors. The movement""s funding gives a hint of how far its political agenda stretches beyond criticizing the excessive use of force by police officers. Fortune also looked at BLM funding in 2016 and noticed its agenda and funding streams could ""help dispel the myth that the movement itself is set on violence,"" but could also ""confirm the worst fears"" of skeptics who saw BLM becoming another part of the vast and protean left-wing money machine. The machinery of BLM funding has only grown more complex since 2016, exacerbating a problem skeptics have warned about from the start: it is very difficult to know what each dollar donated to the movement will actually be used for. BLM""s major financial supporters include: Sources include the above-mentioned Washington Times and Fortune pieces, Politico, Rolling Stone, Forbes, NBC News, The Wrap, and Elle, which has a long list of fashion and cosmetics firms making donations to BLM. ArtNet on Monday published a list of artists and galleries holding charity sales to support BLM. The L.A. Times on Tuesday reported numerous companies are implementing donor-match programs that will match individual employee donations to Black Lives Matter with corporate funds. As several of the above sources pointed out, it""s not always easy to tell when donations are going to BLM itself or its partners. The Financial Times reported that a flood of cash is pouring into civil rights groups, many of them allied with BLM or supportive of its projects. NBC News"" article about ""corporate donations for BLM"" only mentioned a few direct donations to the Black Lives Matter organization; the rest went to groups like the NAACP, ACLU, and Southern Poverty Law Center. Groups like the Ford Foundation, Borealis Philanthropy, and Democracy Alliance tend to establish large funds that are disbursed to many smaller organizations, chapters, and individual activists. Not everyone who claims to be with ""Black Lives Matter"" is a certified member of the group founded by Garza, Cullors, and Tometi. New York Magazine published an approving article on June 4 telling readers how to donate money to the Black Lives Matter movement. The article listed one hundred and fifteen ""funds, organizations, and individual activists"" linked to BLM, and those were just the financial intakes New York felt it had adequately ""vetted"" to ensure they weren""t outright scams. The article subdivided these 115 recommended donation recipients based on how they pledge to use the money they are given, ""whether that""s to post bail/bonds for demonstrators arrested at protests, to purchase protective equipment to protesters on the front lines, to invest in rebuilding black communities where protests have occurred, or to invest in community enrichment programs for black and brown youth."" In the course of a very approving June 6 piece about the growth of bail funds, The Atlantic let slip a little hint about the difficulty of tracing these tens of millions of dollars in donations: ""Whether celebrities – or anyone, for that matter – who donate to a bail fund believe that the system needs a total overhaul is almost irrelevant. Their money equips activists and organizers to do work that tangibly improves the lives of people whom the police often target."" In other words, money is fluid and fungible, and donors often end up financing agendas they might not fully agree with when they give money to a slogan. The value of nearly-ubiquitous corporate promotion of the Black Lives Matter name over the past week is incalculable – there is nothing that kind of full-spectrum, all but inescapable advertising across television, print media, and the Internet could be compared to. The Full BLM Agenda From the earliest days of the BLM movement, as the 2016 pieces cited above indicate, critics have noticed it has a very wide-ranging agenda that reaches far beyond police issues – and, sometimes, working against black lives. At the time of this writing, the top agenda item on the BLM web page is ""Defund the Police"" – a position only a very small minority of Americans supports, including a very small share of black Americans. Black Lives Matter has a lengthy ""What We Believe"" statement on its website that begins with highly contentious and politicized assertions such as expressing rage at ""the death of Trayvon Martin and the subsequent acquittal of his killer, George Zimmerman"" and moving along to ""justice for Mike Brown and all of those who have been torn apart by state-sanctioned violence and anti-Black racism."" Further down the page, the official BLM agenda wanders into support for transgenderism, a vow to ""dismantle cisgender privilege,"" and some very heavy-duty plans for destroying and rebuilding American society: In Boston, Massachusetts, a BLM chapter is asking that $15 million in American taxpayer money be spent on providing summer jobs to — not Black Americans — but illegal aliens. Study after study has revealed that every ten percent increase in the immigrant share of an occupation reduces the income of black American men by roughly five percent. By doing business with companies that support BLM, you might be inadvertently funding its destructive and coercive left-wing policy agenda. Once upon a time, even Democrats understood how radical that agenda was, as a leaked memo from 2015 revealed Democrat Party leadership warning staffers and politicians to keep their distance from the movement. Hashtag Confusion As mentioned above, many people think ""Black Lives Matter"" is a slogan, an ideal, or a grassroots movement, not a political organization with eight figures of funding and a hardcore left-wing policy agenda. This is a very old game practiced by both amateurs and political professionals. Every bill that passes through Congress is given a name that suggests only the most heartless villain could possibly oppose it. Many organizations on both the Left and Right claim to speak for sympathetic constituencies, or carefully cultivate an image of being much less wealthy and powerful than they actually are. In the case of Black Lives Matter, the movement""s slogan is effectively becoming the definition of ""anti-racism,"" which means all disagreement and doubt are racist by definition. This can be seen in the white-hot rage directed at anyone who dares to say ""All Lives Matter,"" for example – a phrase as inherently benevolent and obviously true as ""Black Lives Matter,"" but the ""All"" formulation has been redefined as a vile curse, an unforgivable assault on the purity of Black Lives Matter. That""s a very large ideological umbrella, and plenty of other left-wing groups are jockeying for space beneath it, some of them highly toxic. The Jerusalem Post on Sunday worried about anti-Semitic and anti-Israel forces climbing aboard the BLM train, making an effort to ""hijack the civil rights discourse and portray Israel as a ""settler"" state linked to ""white supremacy."""" ""That hostility is clear when voices such as Marc Lamonte Hill retweet a Ben and Jerry""s tweet supporting the protests with the comment ""we dealing with justice in illegal settlements too or nah?"""" the Jerusalem Post noted, neatly bringing together the issues of unreflective corporate support for BLM and the effort to hook other ideologies to its runaway populist locomotive. More humorously, Yahoo News on Sunday found all sorts of Internet ""influencers"" trying to hitch their wagons to BLM, only to be rebuffed by activists furious at them for trivializing the movement or hijacking its themes for selfish purposes. The line between welcome support and unacceptable exploitation of the movement is blurry. Vegan restaurants are praised for donating money to BLM, for example, while a vegan influencer who endorsed BLM because it""s fighting ""the same fight"" as crusaders against cruelty to animals was forcefully told to keep her deep thoughts to herself. White social media celebrities are taking some heat for trying to insert themselves into the Black Lives Matter movement, often in ways that trivialize the issues and make the protests seem like giant block parties.  A viral tweet of a young woman allegedly getting her companion to take a photo of her in front of a vandalized T-mobile store, presumably for the purposes of posting on social media. BLM itself feels that some of this performative activism dilutes its message and detracts from its policy agenda. For example, the group expressed annoyance with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser allowing ""Black Lives Matter"" to be printed in giant letters on the street in front of the White House because it was a ""distraction"" from ""our demands to decrease the police budget and invest in the community.""  ""Bowser has consistently been on the wrong side of BLMDC history. This is to appease white liberals while ignoring our demands. Black Lives Matter means defund the police,"" BLM said. What does ""Black Lives Matter"" really mean? What agenda are people supporting with their black boxes, tweets, Facebook posts, and financial donations? In this turbulent moment, the movement is having trouble even defining what ""Defund the Police"" really means, perhaps sensing that the position is so unpopular that it must be hastily redefined as ""reform the police, details to come later."" Some BLM leaders insist they are primarily interested in sensible community policing reforms, while others think New York Governor Andrew Cuomo doesn""t swing far enough to the Left.  A popular internet meme poking fun at the premise of last week""s ""Blackout Tuesday"" It seems remarkable that a group with so little discipline, so much confusion over its agenda, and so much money at its disposal would be allowed to effectively demand compulsory support from the entire American public and corporate and political class, without any deep media investigation of its finances, leadership, or agenda. Many of BLM""s donors are signing on to a new social contract with a great deal of fine print they should read more carefully."

breitbart|"Leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have come out against President-elect Joe Biden""s decision to nominate former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg for Secretary of Transportation, recalling his struggles with minority voters. Biden announced Tuesday that Buttigieg was his choice for the transportation post — a plum position for a candidate who dropped out of the presidential race before Super Tuesday and endorsed the former vice president.  As Fox News noted, Buttigieg was criticized in South Bend for failing to fix potholes in his city, whose roads were regarded as among the worst in the state. In addition, Buttigieg faced opposition from the local black community after he demoted the city""s first black police chief, and after a white police officer shot and killed a black man named Eric Logan. Black Lives Matter activists followed Buttigieg on the campaign trail and protested him repeatedly. His attempts to reach out to the black community — including obsequious visits with Al Sharpton — struck many as pandering. In South Carolina, for example,Buttigieg told black voters that he did not have their ""lived experience."" He also routinely drew criticism for overstating his black support. In a statement Tuesday, South Bend-based Black Lives Matter leader Jordan Geiger said: ""We urge the rejection of our former mayor Pete Buttigieg, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, and Rhode Island, Governor Gina Raimondo for Transportation Secretary or any other cabinet position.""  ABC""s Beatrice-Elizabeth Peterson noted that Black Lives Matter leaders have sought a meeting with Biden for more than a month but have not received an invitation. Joel B.

slate|"This month, the WNBA has become the site of one of the most united, persistent political statements in sports history. In recent weeks, entire teams and their owners have come out in support of the Black Lives Matters movement, and their sustained protest effort has forced the league to back off the fines it charged players who used their warm-up outfits to stake ground against racism and police brutality. It started on July 9, when members of the Minnesota Lynx showed up at a game in warm-up shirts printed with ""Black Lives Matter,"" the phrases ""Change Starts With Us"" and ""Justice and Accountability,"" an image of the Dallas police shield, and the names of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, black men killed by police officers that week. (Castile lived, worked, went to college, and died in Minnesota.) The next day, during warm-ups before a game, the New York Liberty wore black T-shirts that said ""#BlackLivesMatter"" and ""#Dallas5."" In the following weeks, players on the Liberty, the Indiana Fever, and the Phoenix Mercury wore plain black shirts by Adidas, the WNBA""s attire sponsor, for several game warm-ups in an attempt to continue their political statement without violating a rule that require player to wear standard warm-up outfits that bear their teams"" logos. The WNBA wasn""t having it. Last week, the league fined the Fever, Liberty, and Mercury $5,000 each and fined each player on those teams $500 for wearing the black shirts. Since the Lynx players stopped wearing their shirts after the July 9 game, when the WNBA sent them a memo warning them of an impending fine, they were spared. ESPN reports that a standard uniform violation fine is $200. Since the fines were announced, the players"" protests have gathered steam and deeper consequence. On Thursday, the Liberty""s Tina Charles accepted a Player of the Month award with her warm-up outfit inside out. In an Instagram post, she castigated the league for supporting ""Breast Cancer Awareness, Pride and other subject matters"" while attempting to silence players in a majority-black league on issues related to racism. The Liberty, Fever, and the Washington Mystics have all refused to answer reporters"" post-game questions unless they relate to the Black Lives Matter movement or other social issues. On Friday, players from the Lynx and the Seattle Storm tweeted photos of the teams in black shirts, though they refrained from wearing them on-court to avoid a fine. The Mystics wore ""Black Lives Matter"" shirts in the locker room after their Friday game. Mystics guard Natasha Cloud told USA Today that the team""s media blackout would last ""until we get support"" from the WNBA. ""We definitely wanted to show our support for those teams that did get fined for wearing just plain black Adidas shirts,"" she said. ""We""re allowed to wear whatever we want to the games, to and from the games, so if they""re going to take away our right and our voice to advocate for something so important to 70 percent of the league which is African American, we""ll find other ways to do it and other ways to do it."" ""We want to be able to use our platforms; we want to be able to use our voices,"" said Liberty guard Tanisha Wright to reporters after Thursday""s game. ""We don""t want to let anybody silence us."" (Wright spoke more about the league""s protests on this week""s episode of Hang Up and Listen.) The teams"" protests had swift impact. WNBA President Lisa Borders announced on Saturday that the she would cancel the fines the league had imposed on the players and teams. ""Appreciate our players expressing themselves on matters important to them,"" she tweeted. ""Rescinding imposed fines to show them even more support."" But the WNBA""s actions are remarkable and commendable for more than just their immediate effects. Rarely have so many players and teams in a league stood together across racial lines on a matter of social import. Several NBA players, including the entire L.A. Lakers team, wore ""I Can""t Breathe"" shirts in memory of Eric Garner in 2014, but it never spread to half the league, as the WNBA""s stand for racial justice has. (For what it""s worth, the NBA did not fine those players for their actions.) Many contemporary athletes have spoken to the history of social activism in professional sports. At this month""s ESPY awards, NBA stars Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Dwyane Wade, and LeBron James located their support for the Black Lives Matter movement within the tradition of forebears like Jesse Owens, Billie Jean King, Jackie Robinson, and Muhammad Ali. ""It""s not about being a role model,"" said James. ""Let""s use this moment as a call to action to all professional athletes to educate ourselves, explore these issues, speak up, use our influence, and renounce all violence. And most importantly go back to our communities. Invest our time, our resources. Help rebuild them. Help strengthen them."" Cleveland Browns wide receiver Andrew Hawkins believes that, since racism keeps most people of color out of the upper echelons of power, those who make it to the top of one of the only majority-minority industries—pro sports—have a special privilege and responsibility. Hawkins has been speaking about racial justice since at least 2014, when he wore a T-shirt onto the field promoting ""justice for Tamir Rice and John Crawford III."" ""I think it""s something bigger than sports,"" he recently told Slate. ""These athletes are some of the only people of color that are given this platform that can really truly raise awareness."" In the case of the WNBA, players risked professional and financial backlash to make their statement. When the Lynx wore their shirts at the July 9 game, four off-duty cops who were hired as arena security personnel left their posts. ""I commend the cops for it,"" the president of the Minneapolis Police Federation, the officers"" union, told the Star Tribune. ""If the players are going to keep their stance, all officers may refuse to work there."" He added, ""They only have four officers working the event because the Lynx have such a pathetic draw."" The league""s protests might have stopped there. Instead, players of all races let criticism and the threat of fines fuel their determination to display a united front. As athletes, they""re setting a new standard for what sports figures can do to support political movements. As activists, though the movement continues, they""ve already won."
slate|"On Thursday, Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee released a trove of about 3,500 Facebook and Instagram ads purchased by Russian operatives to influence the 2016 election and exploit and attempt to worsen America""s polarized political climate in the months that followed. The ads reveal a sophisticated campaign clearly aimed at supporting Donald Trump""s presidential bid and inflaming Americans on some of the most divisive social and political issues in the country, like gun control, Islamophobia, immigration, and police violence. There were even ads aimed at sowing discord among Beyoncé fans. These 3,500 ads are from the Internet Research Agency, a Kremlin-backed operation that is the subject of a February indictment from special counsel Robert Mueller""s ongoing investigation into possible coordination between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, and which Congress has also been investigating since after the election. The ads in this latest cache were posted between mid-2015 and mid-2017 and demonstrate how the Russian trolls used Facebook""s targeting tools to focus its messages on specific demographics of the American population based on users"" race, gender, age, sexual orientation, political affiliation, and interest in things like the Tea Party, Malcolm X, ""funny pics,"" Fox News, and Maya Angelou. Perhaps the most striking thing in this batch of ads—other than the Beyoncé campaign—is how fixated the IRA was on racial tensions in general and Black Lives Matter in particular. While the messages themselves could be crude and meme-y, the ways the ads were targeted showed that the Russian agents understood many of the complex ways racism afflicts so many aspects of American life, in every corner of the country. One ad was targeted to exclude Hispanics and Asian Americans but to include black Americans who enjoy the writing of Maya Angelou and are interested in the trial of imprisoned activist Mumia Abu-Jamal; it included text about Micah Johnson, a black American sniper who shot five police officers during a rally against police violence in Dallas. The ad claimed that the mainstream media was working to paint Johnson as a member of the Black Lives Matter movement. ""The mainstream Media are telling us, that the protest against police terror is a violent anti-government riot!"" the ad read, clearly trying to cultivate distrust in the media among racial-justice activists and those directly interested in writing about race and systemic injustice. This particular ad was shown in July 2016 and included a video with a map of local television stations across the country. There were ads about white supremacy that targeted people interested in HuffPost""s Black Voices section. Another featured an image of a member of the Black Panthers with a baby on his lap next to a photo of three hooded members of the Ku Klux Klan holding a noose under the text, ""I find it very disturbing that the Black Panthers were called terrorists and sent to prison while KKK still exists and legal."" Hundreds of ads were bought about American racism, laser-targeted to people interested in, to take a few examples, ""Understanding racial segregation in the united states,"" and ""Martin Luther King, Jr."" and ""Black is beautiful"" and the ""African American Civil Rights Movement (1954-68)."" It seemed that the more politically aware and interested in American history someone was, the more likely they were to be targeted by this propaganda. IRA trolls seemed to be interested in reaching people who are deeply invested in political history and expressing their beliefs, particularly on the subject of race in America and institutional violence against black people. Hundreds of the ads were focused on police violence toward black Americans. The ads come as Facebook says it is working to better protect its platform against interference by foreign agents ahead of the 2018 midterms and just weeks after its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, sat through two days of questioning from the members of both the House and the Senate about his company""s data-privacy practices and other issues, including Russian propaganda. The release of the ads is another clue that even as the spotlight begins to dampen, Facebook isn""t escaping intense public scrutiny anytime soon. Because what""s at issue isn""t just Russian misbehavior but an entire business model. IRA agents used Facebook""s ad-targeting tools just as they were intended: to reach specific groups of people with specific interests, as revealed through their Facebook likes and listed enthusiasms. This is how Facebook became one of the most powerful companies in the world—through an online advertising empire, unregulated and barely equipped to stymie nefarious use. It can be exploited by anyone looking to target people based on negative stereotypes, racial profiling, and extremely specific points of interest, hitting people with just the right kind of messaging that will provoke a reaction. It""s potentially dangerous and manipulative, especially when used by foreign agents with an agenda to broaden divisions in the American public for their own political ends. Which explains the Russians"" focus on racial injustice, an issue that is always in need of more attention and activism in order for any political change to occur. But the Kremlin""s trolls weren""t hoping to solve anything—they wanted to make people angry. And Facebook was the perfect place to do it."
slate|"You don""t doubt that we live in strange times. But if you did, I would direct your attention to the debate currently raging across the United States between the proponents of two three-word slogans—both of which are, in a sense, obviously true and each of which is obviously compatible with the other. (Indeed, one is a logical consequence of the other.) I""m talking, of course, about ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""All Lives Matter."" How did we get here? I don""t mean: How did Black Lives Matter start? I mean: How did these two phrases come to express disagreement with one another? Some prominent philosophers and social theorists—Judith Butler, Jason Stanley, Chris Lebron, The Funky Academic—have addressed the question. I agree with much of what they""ve said, but I""d like to add my two cents. I think the philosophy of language can help us understand what""s going on, and what I""ve found in some of my research on moral slogans might shed a unique kind of light on the issue. One obstacle to diagnosing the disagreement is semantic; it""s rooted in what ""matter"" means. Saying that something matters is ambiguous between, roughly, a claim about what we ought to care about and a claim about what we actually do care about. It won""t hurt to have labels for these meanings; we can call the first claim normative and the second claim descriptive. There""s a similar ambiguity in claims about rights. In a sense, most people think slaves in the American colonies had a right not to be owned. This is a normative claim about what ought to be the case; it""s one explanation of why slavery was wrong. But in another sense, we might say that slaves had no such right. Of course, that""s the problem: Blacks and Native Americans didn""t have the same rights as whites. This is a descriptive claim about the history of slavery; it""s true just because whites owned large numbers of black and Native American slaves. Similarly, supporters of BLM are making a normative claim to the effect that, roughly, we ought to care (more) about black lives. But they""re making that claim because they believe the corresponding descriptive claim is false—people don""t actually care, or care enough, about black lives. They""re making the normative claim to effect change in the descriptive reality. The slogans conceal one central point of descriptive disagreement. Many proponents of All Lives Matter, I think, believe both the (uncontroversial) normative claim and the descriptive claim that all lives matter. They think that we do, in general, care enough about black lives. (A recent Pew poll found that whites are significantly less likely than blacks to support BLM and significantly less likely to think that blacks are treated less fairly than whites in a number of different domains. A survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found, incredibly, that 53 percent of Americans think discrimination against whites is as significant a problem today as discrimination against blacks and Latinos.) Ironically, the disagreement is that proponents of BLM think that, in the descriptive sense, black lives don""t matter. But that doesn""t explain how the slogans are used to express disagreement. Part of the explanation is pragmatic—it""s rooted in how we use language in interaction. Last week, Rudy Giuliani declared that the claim that black lives matter is ""inherently racist."" If he""s being sincere at all, he""s thinking of the claim as involving what linguists and philosophers of language call a quantity implicature. If a friend and I are trying to figure out how much cash we have on us, and I say that I have $10, my friend will assume that that""s all I have. I""m not saying outright that I have no more than $10, though; I""m implicating or suggesting it. The philosopher Paul Grice explained this in terms of a very general truth about the nature of conversation. In cooperative conversations, we give as much information as is required by the goals of the conversation. If the goal is to figure out how much money we have, and I have more than $10, it would be uncooperative to withhold information about that additional money. Assuming I""m being cooperative, then, if I say I have $10, I must mean that I have no more than $10. So, Giuliani might think, if I believed that non-black lives matter, I wouldn""t just say that black lives matter. But if that""s what Giuliani thinks, he""s wrong. If the goal of our national political conversation were just to ask everyone to list exhaustively all of the things that they think matter, then saying ""Black Lives Matter"" would implicate that only black lives matter. But of course that""s not the goal of our national conversation. In particular, at least one important goal of that conversation is to point out social problems that don""t receive enough attention. The claim that ""Black Lives Matter"" does just that, and it does it without denying the existence of other social problems. It is a way of pointing out that black Americans are especially likely to be brutalized by the police and criminal justice system—and underserved by our schools, barred from voting, and gerrymandered into political irrelevance. (Perhaps the claim that ""All Lives Matter"" could be used to call attention to ways in which all Americans are affected, to a lesser extent, by some of these problems. But it isn""t.) Now, that explains the appearance of disagreement between the two slogans. The disagreement isn""t merely apparent, though. Part of the genuine disagreement lies in the nature of slogans themselves. Consider how moral slogans differ pragmatically from nonslogans that mean roughly the same thing. How does a typical use of a moral slogan like ""Meat is murder"" differ from a use of ""It""s morally wrong to eat meat""? I think in at least two (related) ways. First: The former, but not the latter, is an explicit expression of group solidarity. When I say ""Meat is murder,"" I align myself with a certain social movement—the international vegetarian cause. Second: The former, but not the latter, invokes the moral authority of that group. It""s a bit like the difference between saying ""Rich people are the worst"" and saying ""Eat the rich"" or ""Blessed are the meek"". ""Rich people are the worst"" doesn""t, by itself, suggest how that claim is supposed to be justified or who you can pass the buck to if challenged. ""Eat the rich"" and ""Blessed are the meek"" do. So someone uttering ""Black Lives Matter"" disagrees with someone uttering ""All Lives Matter"" in at least these two ways—in terms of which groups they align with and in terms of which moral authorities they appeal to. This disagreement, unlike the one Giuliani has dreamt up, is very real. It will take more than a little philosophy of language to clear it up. I remember there were people carrying ""All Lives Matter"" signs at the first BLM action I went to. They were there in support of BLM. They didn""t disagree with other marchers—or if they did, it was over the appropriateness of using that phrase to support the BLM cause. The point about slogans can explain this fact; they didn""t disagree because ""All Lives Matter"" hadn""t yet become the slogan that it is today. What are we to make of this? After all, slogans are useful things. ""Black Lives Matter"", for one, has been enormously successful as a rallying cry for social change. And calls for national unity are often disguised attempts to prevent oppressed groups from expressing their specific grievances. But perhaps at this point, at least when we""re talking to the unconverted, slogans unnecessarily deepen disagreement. Perhaps the moral is that, if we want to reach greater agreement on the problems of racial discrimination facing us today—to the extent that that""s possible—we should move away from sloganeering and toward substantive dialogue. In any case, it""s worth a shot. If only there were some tidy encapsulation of the point—preferably one shorter than 140 characters. #DialogueMatters."
slate|"Who is the leader of the protests that have swept across America in the last two weeks? Who is its Martin Luther King Jr., its Mahatma Gandhi, its Nelson Mandela? For that matter, what""s the main organization behind it? Its Southern Christian Leadership Conference or African National Congress? What""s remarkable about this new movement, born from a video of a Minneapolis police officer crushing George Floyd under his knee, is the speed with which it has spread across the country and the world without any central coordination. But this lack of central organization is not unusual these days. The ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong have also been noted for their decentralized, leaderless model. So, for that matter, are a number of protests that have swept the globe in recent months, including the anti-austerity movements in Chile, Ecuador, and Lebanon; protests against corruption and inequality from Haiti to Iraq; nationalist demonstrations in Catalonia, and France""s anti-establishment Gilet Jaunes. These movements differ in the events and underlying conditions that precipitated them, but share a nonhierarchical structure and sense of spontaneity. Many Black Lives Matter activists reject the term leaderless. Patrisse Cullors, the activist who originally promoted the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag in 2013 after George Zimmerman""s acquittal for the killing of Trayvon Martin, refers to it in contrast as a ""leader-full"" movement, in which individual activists are empowered rather than asked to defer to a hierarchy. While the concept has deeper roots, particularly in anti-capitalist and feminist activism, decentralized protest movements have become the norm in recent years. The phenomenon first became apparent around 2011, in the Occupy movement and the Arab Spring protests. The most frequently credited reason for this change is the advent of social media. Iran""s 2010 Green Movement was dubbed the ""Twitter Revolution."" Wael Ghonim, the former Google employee who became a key figure in Egypt""s 2011 Tahrir Square protests, would often thank Mark Zuckerberg in interviews for developing the platform that made organizing the movement possible. This optimism about the possibilities of social media feels very dated today, but it""s undeniable that the internet has opened up possibilities for organizing without a centralized leadership structure. ""What we see here is a totally different media environment than our foremothers in the civil rights movement had. We have the technology and the access to allow more people to take the lead,"" said Meredith Clark, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia who has researched the Black Lives Matter movement""s organizing tactics. But it""s not just about technology. It""s a philosophical difference, too. Clark contrasts the current anti-racist movement""s emphasis on the empowerment of individual activists with ""the civil rights movement, and the leadership we saw at that time, which was highly patriarchal, that focused on respectability, that engaged people along very strict lines."" The discipline of those historical movements could be remarkable. Think of the famous incident on March 9, 1965, when King brought supporters to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, two days after they were beaten by police in the infamous ""Bloody Sunday"" incident, and had them kneel and pray rather than cross the bridge and risk another violent confrontation. A leaderless movement, for better or worse, would have more trouble ensuring everyone turned back from the bridge. But rejecting centralized leadership has certain benefits as well. ""No individual can claim to speak for the whole movement,"" said Carne Ross, a British diplomat-turned-activist and author of The Leaderless Revolution. He recalled an activist telling him during Occupy Wall Street, ""Nobody speaks for me."" The tragic history of the American civil rights movement also points to another limitation of a movement organized around one or two charismatic figureheads. ""If that person was harmed or assassinated, as happened with Martin Luther King or Malcolm X, a large part of the movement dies,"" Clark said. The leaderless movement can be more flexible. In Hong Kong, activists have adopted martial arts star Bruce Lee""s Taoism-influenced motto ""be water"" to describe their resilient and flexible approach. Erica Chenoweth, an expert on nonviolent social movements at Harvard Kennedy School, said there""s research showing that decentralized movements are able to react quickly to challenges and innovate tactics. ""A movement that""s overly organized can become too invested in its own tactics."" The Trump administration""s fixation on the role of antifa, the militant ""anti-fascist"" activists who make up a very small portion of the crowds, suggests the White House wants to avoid confronting how widespread and diverse the support for this movement is. The very spontaneity of the movement is a large part of its power. After the last two weeks, no one should doubt that power. In addition to the historic number of people it has brought onto the streets, the movement has also already achieved several concrete victories, including the city of Minneapolis committing to disbanding its police department, major cities pledging to cut their police budgets, and policing policy changes throughout the country. Popular support for police reform has grown, while President Donald Trump has become less popular and more politically isolated. Still, the decentralized approach is not without its drawbacks. The protests rely on social media to get the message out, plan, and coordinate logistics. ""There""s a greater recognition that the same technologies that are used to organize are being used to surveil,"" noted Clark. In the movement against Bashar al-Assad in Syria, Chenoweth pointed out, ""because of the digital organizing space, it was very easy to figure out who was organizing things, even if there wasn""t a formal leader."" The flipside of tactical innovation, Ross said, is that ""there is no mechanism in a leaderless movement to enforce consistent tactics, particularly when it comes to crossing the line into violence. The risk is that the actions of a few will besmirch the reputation of the whole."" One widely shared video shows two white women, perhaps associated with antifa, graffitiing ""BLM"" on a Starbucks while the woman filming tells them to stop, saying ""they""re gonna blame black people for this."" Other movements have faced this challenge as well. Hong Kong""s protesters were widely criticized after a journalist from China""s state-run Global Times newspaper was assaulted and his hands bound by a crowd during an airport sit-in last August. Other protesters made statements of apology for the incident. It""s also often not clear who is speaking for the movement. ""Black Lives Matter,"" for instance, is a slogan, a decentralized movement, as well as the name of a network of established organizations. When D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser last week renamed a street in front of the White House ""Black Lives Matter Plaza"" and had the slogan painted on the street, she was criticized by the group Black Lives Matter DC, which called the move a distraction from a politician who has supported increasing the budget for the police and had days earlier sent police to crack down on protests. The big-tent approach of decentralized movements is highly effective at getting people into the streets. For instance, some taking part in the current protests may favor the specific policing reforms advocated by groups like Campaign Zero, while others favor defunding or eliminating police forces entirely. But a lack of message discipline can also make it hard to sustain movements once the time comes to translate their goals into lasting policy changes. The Gilets Jaunes protests that emerged in France in 2018 were such a big tent that journalists often seemed unsure if they were a movement of the right or the left. Eventually, they lost momentum over infighting. The Tahrir Square protests may have succeeded in forcing Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak from office, but it was the Muslim Brotherhood, a well-established and highly disciplined political movement, that was in a position to take power after him, until it was eventually ousted by another highly disciplined institution: the country""s military. Then there""s the question of whether these movements are actually as open and egalitarian as they seem. Even the most anarchical movement has underlying power dynamics. In 1970, when leaderless ""consciousness-raising"" groups were growing in popularity within the women""s movement, the feminist scholar Jo Freeman criticized the approach in an article titled ""The Tyranny of Structurelessness,"" which argued that ""there is no such thing as a structureless group. Any group of people of whatever nature that comes together for any length of time for any purpose will inevitably structure itself in some fashion."" Thus, she wrote, structurelessness ""becomes a way of masking power"" that benefits those who best understand a movement""s unwritten rules. Better, she argues, to make the power structure explicit, open to participation and critique by all. The critique is worth keeping in mind. But a less cynical way of viewing this is that lasting formal structures can emerge from informal movements. Decentralized movements ""become organizations in towns and cities where people are active. Narrative control comes from long-standing organizations that have been doing this all along,"" said Chenoweth. This was the case with the first major wave of Black Lives Matter organizing between 2014 and 2016. Many organizers of the initial Black Lives Matter protests have gone on to found new organizations focusing on different aspects and approaches to policing and criminal justice. Whatever its benefits and drawbacks, the decentralized approach is likely to grow more popular. It may be the only approach suited to a world in which there""s growing distrust of large, formal institutions, whether in politics, business, or the media. As they develop and innovate, activists will need to figure out how movements that are inherently mistrustful of power can start wielding it."
slate|"This summer has brought about what seems to be the largest protest movement in American history. Between 15 million and 26 million Americans have participated in demonstrations against police brutality and racism since the killing of George Floyd, a fact almost as stunning as the velocity with which public opinion on American policing has changed. The scale and force of this revolution in social attitudes leaves one grasping for comparisons, however flawed. For instance, I keep reflexively measuring Black Lives Matter against the ways the Me Too movement felt when it erupted in 2017. That movement also tackled a set of deep-seated biases that justified or ignored abusive conduct. Anchored by the New York Times"" and the New Yorker""s reporting on Harvey Weinstein""s pattern of sexual misconduct, Me Too ushered in a nationwide discussion of the ways sexual harassment and assault had been normalized in Hollywood and other industries. Like Black Lives Matter (which started in 2013, after George Zimmerman killed Trayvon Martin), it got a clueless majority to acknowledge and accept as real much that the afflicted community already knew. Me Too did a lot: It ushered in overdue discussions about things like retaliation and consent, changed our default assumptions about how Hollywood should work, and showed a lot of survivors that they weren""t alone. But it also feels like it stalled out. At present, Me Too surfaces most frequently when a high-profile figure is publicly accused of misconduct in the hope that exposure might achieve effects that other more formal channels can""t or won""t. The backlash to this process came quickly, deploying the phrase ""cancel culture"" to condemn these informal alternatives as illiberal or worse. It seems reasonable to say, given the ongoing debates over censorious speech, that this backlash has now come for the Black Lives Matter movement. If this backlash links the two movements, it""s also what makes the comparison fraught. Me Too seemed to be rocketing toward a social revolution in 2017—by then, BLM was already several years old and had gone through a few iterations without gaining widespread support (according to polls). Me Too was less of an organized movement and more an eruption of testimonies revealing just how common harassment and assault are in American workplaces, and how much these dynamics contributed to power imbalances, especially between men and women. Instances of lonely, private, and humiliating abuse added up to an accidental ""sisterhood"" of people shocked to discover the scope of their lamentable common ground. Problems are easier to agree on than solutions given this kind of unsought-for bond; after all, victims of abuse might not have anything but the abuse in common. It""s not surprising, therefore, that instead of generating better formal pathways for addressing sexual assault allegations, an ad hoc system developed: Malefactors were accused on the internet, and the results of those exposures varied. It certainly wasn""t a ""culture"" of anything: The efforts were stochastic, and the outcomes seemed random. It was clear from the start that online testimonials were never going to offer a recipe for lasting, transformative change. An outburst, however pained and honest, can""t and shouldn""t become a protocol; a functional society would surely develop better channels for those seeking redress. None developed. Not really. I don""t mean to downplay Me Too. Big and messy and spontaneous and imperfect though it was, it was encouraging to see so many people wrestling with complicated questions about consent and power and how our default assumptions have disfavored female workers and driven them out of industries. Some of that wrestling has led to visible change: Harvey Weinstein, for example, was convicted this year on evidence the average American would not have found persuasive even five years ago—back then, most would have found it unthinkable (for example) that a victim of sexual assault might go on to have consensual sex with her assailant. Some states and Congress took necessary steps, but many of those measures (like providing funding for rape kits to be processed) felt more remedial than progressive. But my hope was that some paradigm for adjudicating claims would emerge out of all this, developed with input from survivors for a change. And I hoped we""d figure out how to talk about hierarchies of harm, the ongoing needs of victims, the derailed careers of people who deserved to confront or reenter fields they were harassed out of, and the knottiest problem of all: how to hold offenders accountable and eventually reintegrate them into the social fabric. That hasn""t happened. And it does a lot to explain where we are today. Without going so far as to say Me Too failed—movements take time to take root and get where they need to go, and BLM had spent more time in the trenches—it seems true that for now at least, the momentum is gone, and the movement is stuck in a game of predator whack-a-mole that has reduced it to a convenient exhibit in the ""cancellation"" wars now dominating media discussions. I asked Anna Holmes, founder of the blog Jezebel, whether Me Too and Black Lives Matter were worth comparing. A veteran of the feminist internet, Holmes has a unique (and understandably jaded) view of how corporate and feminist concerns have intersected over the past few years—to the detriment of the latter. She said that was one reason the movements didn""t feel alike to her. ""My experience and memory of how Me Too evolved was really first rooted in Hollywood, in this industry that we all participate in as consumers but that we don""t necessarily work in."" So while the challenges faced by women in entertainment mattered, she said, it was not a revolution that immediately extended to you and me. It also might not have helped, it occurs to me, that Me Too articulated its goals using the language of belief. ""Believe Women"" always risked mistaking inward-facing transformations for structural change, and the bad faith reading it made available (which many conservatives encouraged by misstating it as ""Believe ALL Women"") was arguably catastrophic: The confusion over Tara Reade""s allegations against Joe Biden proved how ill-equipped the movement, caught between two white male candidates with female accusers (coupled with Reade""s credibility problems) really was. Yes, ""Believe Women"" was meant to name and defamiliarize the tendency to reflexively doubt them. And it did that. The phrase in that way resembles ""Black Lives Matter"": Both are deceptively mild provocations. Hard though it is to disagree with either, both elicit enormous resistance from certain quarters. Shouldn""t all people be believed? Shouldn""t all lives matter? They should, of course! The point of these mottos is to drive home the extent to which those expectations have not been met for these groups in particular. These are useful interventions! But on the whole, it feels like Me Too didn""t get too much further than that, remaining stuck at the consciousness-raising stage. The BLM slogan ""Defund the Police,"" by contrast, is neither mild nor inward-looking: It prioritizes large-scale policy change over internal adjustments. And it has been, by any measure, amazingly effective. (Oakland, California, where I live, spent last Tuesday evening debating whether and how to defund the police.) Me Too hasn""t yet found that second gear. As my former colleague Aisha Harris, who edits and writes for the New York Times opinion section, said to me: ""There are still obviously a lot of industries Me Too didn""t even touch. And I think that it""s also become an easy way for some people to dismiss claims. Oh, the Me Too people have gotten out of control."" Hemmed in by claims that Me Too had both gone too far and not far enough, a movement that started out with raw and painful exposures and the activism of women like Tarana Burke started to seem glossy and focus-grouped. The Times Up pins. The black dresses on red carpets. Holmes remembered attending a for-profit women""s conference where a conversation on 21st century feminism was headlined by Jennifer Aniston and Gloria Steinem. ""The organizers were putting on a show, and it was demeaning to the discussions and the hard work of the people who I felt should have been on that stage,"" Holmes said. As businesses have rushed to declare their public support of Black Lives Matter, I""ve worried that the movement might get similarly diluted by corporate gestures that manage both to reflect the power of the movement and to trivialize it. Black Lives Matter has so far prioritized structural change over specific cases with extraordinary rigor. Still, it risks becoming a victim of its own success. Purely performative gestures like turning one""s Instagram black for a day were easy to mock, but public accusations about toxic, inequitable workplaces (and the resignations that ensued) occupy an uneasy in-between stage between top-down corporate efforts to market to the new reality and the ground-level demands that give Black Lives Matter its urgency. It""s this intermediate terrain that sparked the by now familiar backlash, threatening to drown out discussions of police brutality with conversations about intolerance from the left, especially in media. ""I worry that it""s a little inside baseball,"" Holmes said of the reckoning currently happening in media circles. ""Representation in media, which is something that I""m concerned about, and have been very angry about for a long time … I just found myself thinking, now""s not the time. And the reason that it troubles me is because, first of all, I don""t know when the time is. So who am I to say now is not the time? But there was an echo of Me Too in that there was maybe an inordinate focus on the elites, for lack of a better word."" Harris thinks this is the time, but she agreed that resignations weren""t going to be enough. Neither was simply hiring more people of color. ""It""s going to take way more than just editors in chief and other people stepping aside,"" she said. ""There has to be actual work being done in hiring people, and not just as fellows or as interns, but in managerial positions and editing positions at outlets. Retention is also a huge issue,"" she said. ""I""m not overly optimistic, but I""m also not despairing."" When I started writing this, Black Lives Matter was dominating the national conversation nearly every day. The media resignations and firings were the sideshow. That""s no longer the case. Instead, as happened with Me Too, an adjacent discussion has come to dominate in the tetchy doldrums of the internet where ""cancel culture"" gets endlessly litigated. During Me Too, the phrase that cropped up most frequently in this connection was ""due process."" In its present iteration, it""s ""free speech."" I""ve heard a lot more about speech-chilling online mobs these last few weeks than I have about police brutality—interrupted only recently by the disturbing sight of unidentified federal forces in Portland, Oregon, accosting (and detaining) protesters. It seems obvious that the latter is more serious. But denying the fervor of the former camp seems pointless; the media""s detrimental obsession with ""cancel culture"" must be addressed. I""d like, therefore, to give Cerberus his sop: Yes, ""cancellations"" do happen. People have indeed lost their jobs because people with no direct power over them have publicly criticized them on the internet in response to some action or pattern or behavior. Some high-profile editors have resigned. So have a few CEOs. Blake Neff lost his job writing for Tucker Carlson. Amy Cooper lost her job and faces charges for calling 911 on a birdwatcher. That these incidents are comparatively rare is true but in some ways beside the point. So is the fact that people have for decades been fired for actions and speech their employers found objectionable. There""s a bias toward the present in this panic, and the impression is that people everywhere are newly at risk of losing their livelihoods for saying the wrong thing. Data scientist David Shor has become a cause célèbre in these debates and for good reason: Virtually everyone agrees that Shor""s employer should not have fired him for public criticism he received, if that was indeed the reason for his firing. (It""s a curious but telling feature of the proxy wars being fought here that little anger seems to be directed at the employer who did the actual firing.) Save for Shor, the examples garnering the most attention have been higher-ups in elite industries who are newly vulnerable to subordinates and even to outsiders who—thanks to the internet—can bang their pots louder than at any time in history. No one knows or understands the limits of this destabilizing inversion. The alarm has much to do with power, certainly. As with Me Too, it may also seem as if the ""rules"" suddenly changed to punish and pathologize behavior Americans used to tolerate and even embrace. The scope of behavior that ought to be seen as sexist expanded under Me Too. The scope of conduct that ought to be considered racist is presently expanding. Anxiety over this change—and any attendant charges of complicity—may be driving the obsessive attention being paid not just to firings and resignations but to any race-based objections by subordinates that critics simply don""t agree with (two cases in which professors remained employed and consequence-free despite complaints from their students tend to crop up as examples of speech-chilling censoriousness). Many Americans are changing the ways they weigh evidence and process information from different sources—maybe forever. The police officer""s account (the banal explanations of ""resisting arrest"" or ""reaching for a weapon"") has lost the automatic acceptance it once enjoyed. Just as, thanks to Me Too, the accused rapist""s denial (""it was consensual at the time"" or ""this is about money"") no longer persuades in the way it once did. Those inward transformations might matter after all, insofar as they build support for societal changes. But the group I think of as the ""cancel critics"" is less worried about charting this wobbly trajectory than it is the professional consequences within a far smaller bubble. ""Cancel culture"" is less a description than a fundamentally elitist complaint, and I""m not the first to point out that the alarm seems a little disproportional given the built-in vagaries of the American labor market, the ongoing disintegration of the media industry in particular, the 51 million Americans who have filed for unemployment, and the fact that in a recent poll, 53 percent of respondents felt there should be social consequences for offensive speech, yet only 32 percent of respondents viewed ""cancel culture"" favorably. The branding has started to overshadow the content. No one calls it a ""cancellation"" when a higher-up fires a lower-down worker, even when the reasons are obscure. At-will employment and arbitrary terminations are features of jobs as most of us know them: The higher-up gets to make the call. To the extent that ""cancel culture"" exists as a weak force that produces sporadic countervailing results, it unsettles the usual flow of power. Not only are lower-downs influencing professional consequences, they""re able to do so in ways that might seem capricious, or arbitrary, or inaccurate. A nontrivial amount of power has shifted—incompletely, and not in a systematic way. (One way to help systematize that rebalancing of power in companies: unions!) What was true of Me Too remains true of BLM: ""Cancellations"" emerged in response to a lack of institutional power, and in response to systems designed to ignore legitimate complaints. It""s only natural for critics to seek out limits on the exercise of this new power. Anyone conversant in the capricious injustice of the old system wants (consciously or subconsciously) to be reassured that they won""t suffer equally arbitrary treatment from the other side. But this is where the real ""cancel culture"" boogey monster lives, I think: A lot of people seem to be operating under a tacit understanding that employers who fire ""racist"" employees had no agency of their own. This is a bizarre but revealing assumption. For ""cancel culture"" critics, leftist agitators are presently understood to have too much influence on the cold-blooded corporate incentives they used to have no sway over. If you""re a leftist, this picture of reality is pretty bananas! The 2017 Women""s March, for instance, was a massive, peaceful statement that was ultimately understood to be an expression of civic despair requiring no institutional response. Protests against the invasion of Iraq did nothing to slow the invasion. Occupy Wall Street became a punchline. All of these movements laid organizing groundwork on the left but were dismissed with extraordinary ease by those in power. This country got extremely comfortable metabolizing and ignoring leftist protest. It""s disorienting, then, to see the left chastised by media elites for its overwhelming and undue influence over … corporate firings. I""m going through all this because it""s hard to assess how Black Lives Matter may fare in the coming months without understanding the forces that may slow it down—just as they slowed down Me Too. The phrase ""cancel culture"" managed to reframe a desperate response to structural exclusion as itself abusive and censorious. The backlash to Me Too stranded the public imagination in a quagmire of questions over whether—despite ludicrously small concrete advances—it has gone ""too far."" And the backlash was effective because Holmes is right, I think: Me Too did indeed begin as an elite movement, and it didn""t manage to extend too far beyond that. I don""t expect it to work with Black Lives Matter because the movement didn""t originate, and still doesn""t reside, in the elite media space—the ""intermediate terrain"" I mentioned above—where the backlash is loudest. Governments are now doing something that was unthinkable even three months ago: They""re taking measures to curb police abuses. Minneapolis has announced that it is disbanding its police force. Colorado got rid of qualified immunity. Even Republicans in Congress are debating police reform. It""s hard to overstate how much damage police forces across this country have inflicted on the very illusions that have for decades worked in their favor. In video after video of police beating Americans, they have proved how little they have deserved the extraordinary public trust they once enjoyed. And as Black Lives Matter transcends the structurally disadvantaged position that made ""cancellations"" a logical and necessary supplement to a dysfunctional system, it is moving way ahead of the spats between media personalities (over what the limits of free speech should be) and making headway in the actual halls of power. So here""s my charitable read of the cancel critics: We are living through a moment when a lot of basic principles that organize society are being renegotiated. I have sympathy for that disorientation, and this is not the first time these very debates have been had, as Osita Nwanevu pointed out in a Twitter thread collecting examples of similar critiques over the past few decades. But in a nationwide crisis where people are being beaten and arrested for asserting their free speech rights, some elite media critics are having difficulty seeing beyond the tempest in a teapot afflicting their own circle. Holmes and Harris are right: Me Too began as an elite movement and a media story and mostly remained within those ecosystems. Black Lives Matter is happening in the streets, in organizing spaces, in council meetings, in Moms for Housing, in places that are fundamentally not bounded by media. Without the media, Me Too couldn""t have happened. If that were true of Black Lives Matter, it might have petered out by now too. Both movements sparked under the combustible frustration of populations that were formally excluded from the egalitarian ideas expressed during America""s founding, and both erupted during Donald Trump""s presidency, perhaps in partial response to the racism and misogyny he has openly and persistently linked to American identity. If both movements are getting caught up in the tar pits of America""s ""cancel culture"" wars—wherein critics implicitly demand that protesters live up to standards the institutions they""re protesting have egregiously failed to uphold—Black Lives Matter stands a better chance of making it out."
slate|"On a sunny October afternoon, one day before the start of early voting, a small crowd of people gathered on the courthouse steps in the small city of Graham, North Carolina. Hoisting Black Lives Matter banners and green, red, and black flags, wearing face masks, they faced the 30-foot-tall Confederate statue they have repeatedly asked the county""s board of commissioners to remove. Men in pickup trucks flying Thin Blue Line flags occasionally drove past, honking and shouting, but most in the crowd kept their eyes fixed on the Rev. Gregory Drumwright, the pastor of a large, youth-focused church and campus ministry in nearby Greensboro. He""d gathered people here to announce ""I Am Change"" marches in Greensboro and Graham on Oct. 30 and 31, the last two days of North Carolina""s early voting period. ""Our marching is about more than just a monument,"" Drumwright told the crowd. ""It""s about the systems of white supremacy, bigotry, and violence that shadow this monument."" At a time when national media is laser-focused on the presidential race, and in a state that is a must-win for Donald Trump, no one at this gathering spoke Donald Trump""s or Joe Biden""s name. Instead, Drumwright repeated the names of victims of police and racial violence: Trayvon Martin, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tamir Rice, Jonathan Price, Sandra Bland—and one long-ago victim, Wyatt Outlaw, the first African American appointed to the town council in Graham, lynched by white supremacists in 1870. Drumwright also called out the names of local elected officials—Sheriff Terry Johnson, whose department was sued by the U.S. Department of Justice under President Barack Obama for discriminatory policing against Latinos, and Bill Lashley Sr., an Alamance County commissioner who, in conversation with Johnson in May 2020, publicly praised police brutality in an open meeting. ""You can""t do now what we used to when I was on the force,"" Lashley lamented at that meeting. ""We used to beat the hell out of ""em!"" Lashley, whose term expires this year and whose son is now running as a Republican for an open commissioner seat, is also a vocal opponent of removing the Confederate monument. Drumwright doesn""t think that""s a coincidence. ""This is the attitude of commissioners right here in Graham, North Carolina, that refuse to remove or even entertain conversations about removing this monument,"" the reverend said. Drumwright regularly passed the Graham courthouse""s Confederate monument while growing up in nearby Burlington; to him, it was just another statue. ""It meant nothing to me,"" he said, explaining that he had not been taught the statue""s history or significance as a symbol of white supremacy. He didn""t learn much about slavery, segregation, or the civil rights era until he left Alamance to study at North Carolina A&T, the largest historically Black university in the country. Today the monument is at the center of a growing movement for political power in Alamance. In June, more than 50 community leaders—including mayors, school board members, clergy, and businesspeople—signed an open letter asking county commissioners ""to relocate the monument in a respectful and appropriate manner."" When the commissioners refused, a coalition of local groups began weekly protests. On July 11, more than 700 protesters marched from Burlington to Graham, demanding its removal. Often met by neo-Confederate counterprotesters and police they say target them for harassment and arrest, they have demonstrated every weekend since. Drumwright""s vision for the Halloween weekend marches is dramatic. He wants attendees of all ages and races to dress up, but not in the usual Marvel Comics or Disney princess costumes. ""We""re gonna march down these streets with Skittles in our hands in honor of Trayvon Martin""s legacy,"" Drumwright said near the end of his speech, his voice drowning out the sound of traffic. ""We""re gonna march down these streets with hoodies on our heads, with George Floyd""s name on our backs."" To prepare for the march, organizers are relying on word of mouth, outreach to local churches and community centers, and social media posts. They hope that turnout will be enhanced by the promise of speeches from George Floyd""s niece, Brooke Williams, and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. In both Graham and Greensboro, the marches will culminate at the polls. Black Lives Matter organizers locally and nationally have wrestled with the role of electoral politics in their broader call to end state-sanctioned violence against Black people. As a movement founded on grassroots principles, Black Lives Matter has no central leadership, and activists in the movement have declined to endorse political candidates. They have repeatedly made the point that the movement""s goals are larger than getting out the vote. But organizers in Alamance County hope that attention to local politics can motivate new and intermittent voters. They also see a chance to build political power that lasts beyond a single election. Alamance County""s board of commissioners consists of five white Republicans who generally support the priorities of Sheriff Terry Johnson, who once instructed his deputies to ""bring me some Mexicans."" In 2019, they voted to expand the county jail to detain asylum-seekers through a $2.3 million contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, provoking a wave of protests. Many local activists feel that Johnson, who has held office since 2002, stifles BLM and anti-ICE protest through intimidation and arrests. ""As soon as a demonstration starts, there""s so much police presence,"" said Tanisha Richards, who works with Drumwright as a minister at the Citadel of Praise Church and lives in Alamance. ""If you saw a bird""s-eye view of a protest, there""s a lot of herding that ends up happening. That""s what it feels like and looks like—you""re being herded."" Drumwright was ""called home,"" as he says, by Quenclyn Ellison, president of the Alamance Alliance for Justice, in the spring. Ellison knew many people were afraid to speak out or demonstrate against pervasive racism that had only intensified since 2016. It was hard to speak out—Ellison often attends County Board of Commissioners meetings with fellow activists but, thanks to ever-changing rules, is rarely given a chance to speak. ""We spend lots of time planning, but we don""t usually get heard,"" she said. She""d followed Drumwright""s activism and hoped he could inspire a movement in place where, as the Guardian recently pointed out, some Black citizens are afraid to even put out yard signs for progressive candidates or voice support for BLM. Drumwright was surprised and disheartened by the fear he heard at their first organizing meeting, attended by about 20 Black and Latinx religious and community leaders at Morgantown Baptist Church. Though he knew that Alamance had a history of white supremacy and neo-Confederate groups, he had not expected people to be afraid to march. ""I was taken aback at how deeply the system of racial oppression had manifested itself there in Alamance County. Those same people who are now challenging that system sat in a room with me and said, ""Do you think it""s OK that we tell people that we""re talking and meeting about this?"" Those same people were hesitant to even announce the march."" Clearly, there was work to do—not just organizing and building awareness, but also educating people about the rights of citizens and the role of public officials. ""Most people can""t tell you what a county commissioner does,"" said Rion Thompson, a local activist and campaign manager for Alamance County commissioner candidate Dreama Caldwell, who if elected will become the first Black woman commissioner in the county""s history. ""That is intentional."" Local elections will affect the funding of public schools, determine the sheriff""s budget and ability to negotiate contracts with ICE, and direct the county""s response to citizens"" concerns and complaints, like the repeated requests to relocate the Confederate monument. These decisions have a broader economic impact, said Bob Byrd, who served for four years as the only Democrat on the Alamance Board of Commissioners before being voted out in 2014. Byrd is running for reappointment to the board this year, along with two other Democrats. ""If you believe in a strong system of public education, it matters,"" he said. ""If we want to have a community that""s welcoming to everyone, it makes a difference."" Ellison, Drumwright, Thompson, and other leaders in the movement—almost all of them under 40 years old—are working to educate an electorate that has been largely ignored by both parties. They""re betting that a focus on local issues, like policing, and down-ballot candidates with deep investment in the community, like Caldwell, will inspire young people to vote—and to demand accountability from elected officials accustomed to ignoring them. Spencer Blackwell, a 24-year-old organizer who helped plan the march in July, smiled when asked what he knew about the county commissioners race. ""Ms. Dreama?"" he asked. ""She was my Head Start teacher."" Alamance, a mostly rural county west of Chapel Hill, was once known for textile mills and hosiery manufacturing. The county""s mills and factories were almost all closed in the 1990s as the textile industry moved overseas or to Mexico, and many of the old brick mill buildings along the Haw River have been converted into lofts, charter schools, and businesses serving the new residents who work in Chapel Hill, Durham, and Greensboro. Though the higher incomes of these commuters keep Alamance""s poverty rate about average for the state—13 percent—Alamance""s child poverty rate, 27 percent, is significantly higher than the state or national average. A quarter of all Alamance households lack broadband internet access. Occasionally Alamance makes national news—usually for something unfortunate. This year, you might have heard about Alamance""s Ace Speedway, a stock car racetrack which operated before packed stands in defiance of the governor""s orders, or about the city of Graham""s controversial ban on public protests, which had to be enjoined by a federal judge after a lawsuit filed by the Alamance NAACP branch and eight individuals, including Drumwright. This year""s protests started after the state""s March 3 presidential primary, so the upcoming election will be the first test of the movement""s electoral power. ""I always struggle with trusting a process that was made to exclude people who look like me,"" said Thompson, describing the near-constant redistricting and racial gerrymandering that dilute Black voters"" power, including prison-based gerrymandering, which inflates the census counts in many rural communities. North Carolina is one of only eight states requiring a witness signature for mail-in ballots, an obvious problem for older voters and other people at higher risk for COVID-19 complications or death. ""We do not center the voting process on the most marginalized folks,"" said Thompson. Additionally, Black voters in North Carolina are over three times more likely than white voters to have their mail-in ballots rejected, and thanks to a ruling from a federal judge, voters are no longer able to correct ballots missing a witness signature, or even with minor deficiencies, with an affidavit. They have to recast their ballots by mail or in person. Although the North Carolina State Board of Elections extended the deadline for receipt of mail-in ballots to Nov. 12 as long as they are postmarked on Election Day, Republican state legislators challenged the decision in court. The 4th Circuit ruled in favor of the extended deadline, but the Supreme Court, following Monday""s 5–3 decision blocking an extended ballot deadline in Wisconsin, seems likely to reverse that decision. Ernest Lewis, third vice chair of the Alamance Democratic Party, said that, while he knows the board is trying its best to reach voters with rejected ballots, time is short. ""I""m concerned about it,"" he said. ""Are we going to reach those people fast enough?"" By Friday, Oct. 23, about 33 percent of Alamance County""s voters had cast their ballots by mail or early voting, and organizers predict that by the time polls close on Nov. 3, between 72 and 75 percent of registered voters will have voted, a significant increase over the 70 percent turnout recorded by the county in 2016. How many of these voters are the more left-leaning millennials or Gen Z may decide the outcome for local races and even the presidency. Though the organizers in Alamance look forward to marching new voters to the polls, they hope that participants come away from the experience with more than a single-use ""I Voted"" pen. ""One of the narratives that""s always pushed to us is that we need to vote, and that""s not wrong. But George Floyd and Breonna Taylor were not killed due to not voting or not being registered to vote,"" Thompson said. ""I will be remiss if I do not make the point that voting is not enough and it has never been enough."" The goal of the Halloween weekend marches varies, depending on whom you ask. For educator and activist Kani Adon Bynum, it""s about building relationships. ""My goal is to meet and network with like-minded people,"" he said. ""These people are my family."" For Ellison, whose niece and daughter watched her speak at the event, it""s about making her hometown a safer, more welcoming, equitable place for families like hers. Ellison plans to attend the march with her daughter Malyiah, a 10th grader who wonders why, at her school, they ""never talk about the real stuff,"" or learn about the history right under their feet. And for Drumwright, it""s about making sure that the county where he grew up, and where many in his family still live, is not left behind. ""Change is already happening all over America,"" he said, referring to the long early voting lines at early voting polling places around the country. ""Alamance County will not be an exception."""
slate|"Among the many viral videos of nationwide protests against police brutality this past week was a clip of a tense scene from Merrick, New York, a mostly white town on Long Island. On Tuesday, residents tried to block 100 Black Lives Matter protesters from marching down Merrick Road, yelling ""Get them the hell out of here!,"" and suggesting that they be rerouted to march through a more diverse town nearby.* Undaunted, protesters returned on Wednesday, to scattered reports of conflict. The renewed demonstration was largely peaceful; this time, a viral video of 7-year-old protester Wynta-Amor Rogers marching and chanting dominated the coverage. Still, the incidents on Tuesday had some wondering: What is going on, out there on Long Island, given its location in a blue state and its proximity to liberal New York City? (The actor Billy Baldwin tweeted: ""I grew up near #Merrick … Lots of good people there but like many other towns on Long Island … far too many ignorant, intolerant pricks."") I spoke with Douglas Massey, a sociologist at Princeton University who writes about residential segregation, about Long Island""s unique history, and its enduring divisions. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Rebecca Onion: What is it about Long Island""s history that has left it so segregated in 2020? Douglas Massey: Long Island, specifically Nassau and Suffolk counties, is an entirely suburban region. Although it was given its own designation as a metropolitan area, that was a political act rather than a demographic act. But it doesn""t really have a central city, other than New York. It""s entirely suburban. As a suburban area, it was influenced very heavily by the housing policies that prevailed in the period from 1950 to the mid-1970s. When the suburban housing boom happened, and Levittown was created, and Long Island was built up, these suburbs were deliberately racially segregated by federal, state, and local policies. The Federal Housing Administration basically refused to grant mortgages to black borrowers to buy houses in the suburbs. The agency required inspection approval of the neighborhood as a suitable place to loan, and referred people to what are called residential security maps that coded neighborhoods according to their creditworthiness; black neighborhoods always got red the practice known as ""redlining"". So, basically, FHA policy precluded lending in black neighborhoods and to black individuals. And this was perfectly legal until 1974. Suburban areas on Long Island were segregated by public policy well into the civil rights era, well past when the Fair Housing Act was passed in 1968. There""s a lot of inertia built into the residential distribution on Long Island. Redlining was finally outlawed in 1977, but there was a lot of inertia, and things change very slowly. The fact that discrimination in mortgage lending and in the rental and sale of housing was outlawed didn""t mean the discrimination stopped. It more or less went underground, and became less evident, and could only be discovered by audit studies. The most recent one was that big study that Newsday did in 2019 of discrimination by realtors on Long Island, which found out it was going on even to this very day, at quite high levels—discriminating against blacks in particular, but as the Latino population grew, the Puerto Rican population of New York suburbanized, and new migrants from Mexico and Central America arrived, they were also subject to discrimination. This became a real problem on Long Island because it was a job growth center, but it wasn""t providing housing opportunities for the low-wage workers that they needed to get in order to take local service jobs. So Latinos in particular were moving into suburban areas that were zoned for single-family use, and cramming into houses in suburban areas. And that""s basically because these suburbs had refused to allow the building of affordable housing, and so they were making do, adapting as best they could. Can you talk a little bit more about the idea of inertia? I""m curious when you""re studying patterns of segregation whether that word has a specific meaning for you. Is it just, the idea that people""s minds take a long time to change? Well, yes, people""s minds don""t change, and their behavior doesn""t change unless you make them change. When they could get away with discrimination where it was out of view, they did, and it""s only when you start enforcing fair housing law that you bring about systemic changes. Inertia is also built into the housing stock, because once you build the place and you fill it with white people, it takes time for neighborhood turnover to occur and status quo ante to change. Looking across metropolitan areas all over the country, you find that metropolitan areas with newer housing stock—that is, housing that was built after the Fair Housing and Fair Lending acts—the more housing was built after the civil rights era, the lower the levels of segregation. Inertia also has a legal foundation, and that is that in the postwar period, suburbs increasingly came to be covered by restrictive density zoning rules that precluded construction of multiunit housing, which is basically the cheapest way to provide housing that""s affordable to regular working people. And so that also perpetuates segregation through zoning regulations, which have been shown by research, some of which I""ve done, to be a principal cause of both racial and class segregation in the current era. And even after the civil rights era reforms, these laws are in place, and they""re only beginning to be challenged on civil rights grounds. In New Jersey, the Supreme Court in the ""80s decided that under the state constitution, you couldn""t write zoning regulations to preclude the construction of affordable housing. So New Jersey""s kind of been leading the way and pushing forward to make affordable housing more widely available in metropolitan areas, including white and more affluent suburbs, but it""s been a tough sale to people in New York, and especially on Long Island. Watching the viral coverage of protests and counterprotests in Merrick this week, I was interested to see how clearly it seemed the counterprotestors were willing to articulate exactly what they understood to be the geography of segregation around them. In the videos, you can hear them saying, ""Go west!"" Yes. This is not a new story. When Martin Luther King first took the movement out of the South into the North, he went to Chicago and marched in a Chicago suburb, and faced all kinds of epithets, bottle-throwing, and things. … He said it was worse than anything he faced in the South. And with Trump, with the president saying openly racially discriminatory things, it""s uncorked things people weren""t going to say in public. Explicitly saying, ""Go back to the neighborhood where you belong."" Then again, I did a study using the 2010 census that looked at metropolitan areas, rather than suburbs, that linked ongoing racial prejudice to high levels of segregation. So this isn""t something unique to the Trump era. It""s been around for quite a while."
slate|"Black Lives Matter is reverberating around the world, triggering a fresh reckoning with the racist global history of colonialism and slavery. While Confederate statues began to tumble across the American South, in Bristol, England, a diverse group felled a statue of a slave trader that has long provoked offense. Statues of colonial conquerors of Africa and South Asia have followed, along with a robust discussion of the ways in which such actions make history rather than erase it. These movements abroad are not merely echoes of BLM; BLM itself is global. The shared impetus is a common opposition to racism, of which anti-Black racism has been the most lethal and traumatic. But the history of policing also bridges them. No historical figure makes this clearer than George Orwell, whose name has been increasingly bandied about in recent weeks—by those fretting about the erasure of history as well as those calling out the euphemistic language around policing, such as the use of ""nonlethal"" bullets against protesters. The right and left have long fought over Orwell, who identified as a socialist but authored what many consider the iconic literary critique of socialism, 1984. This is a man who showed us the moral evil of the totalitarian quest for mind control and a culture of denunciation but also compiled a list of untrustworthy leftists for the British Foreign Office; a critic of empire and believer in human equality who persisted in writing and thinking in blatantly racist ways. But his central beef was always with policing, whose tyrannical power he discovered through his own experiences as a colonial police officer. Born Eric Blair, Orwell described himself with characteristic precision and irony as a member of the ""lower-upper-middle class."" He went to Eton but on a scholarship. His family had status but not money. Through University College London""s Legacies of British Slave-ownership project, we know that the Blairs traced whatever status they still had in Orwell""s lifetime to earlier ownership of slaves. Orwell""s great-great-grandfather was a slave owner in Jamaica in a time in which slavery was part of a colonial system connecting Europe, West Africa, South Asia, and the Americas. The Blairs were among the 3,000 slave-owning families who received a total 20 million pounds in compensation (now worth more than $2 billion) when slavery was abolished in the British empire. The Blair family held on to its status thanks to opportunities that continued to be afforded by British colonialism. Orwell was born in India, where his father was an official in the Indian Civil Service. His mother was the daughter of a teak merchant in Burma (today, Myanmar; then part of British India). The humiliation he felt at boarding school for his relatively poorer means prepared him for a life of ""ruin,"" which he understood variously as: ""the colonies or an office stool, perhaps prison or an early death."" Fatefully, he wound up a police officer in British India. But he quit after five years out of a deep sense of shame, evident in his first published piece of writing (still under the name Eric Blair), a short piece titled ""A Hanging"" (1931), in which the narrator, a police officer in Burma, is quietly complicit in the execution of a colonial subject whose crime we are not told—it is irrelevant to the point Orwell wanted to make about the inhumanity of the system that policed and killed him. A dog is the only being that acknowledges the prisoner""s humanity, jumping up to lick his face, to the crowd""s horror. It was in Burma that Orwell first discovered thought-policing: ""You are not free to think for yourself,"" he explained in his first novel, Burmese Days (1934). ""Your opinion on every subject … is dictated for you by the pukka sahibs code,"" in which you too are complicit so that ""your whole life is a life of lies."" Colonial policing also sharpened Orwell""s awareness of the anesthetizing effects of sanitized language, whose apotheosis, he showed us, was the soulless Newspeak of 1984. In this period, in the Middle East, on the Indian frontier, and in East Africa, work previously performed ""by policemen and sticks"" was undertaken by the Royal Air Force, with aircraft and bombs. Orwell summarized aerial policing""s abuse of humanity and language: ""Defenseless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called pacification."" These British innovations would deeply influence the development of American military and policing power. Orwell came to see British rule in India as an ""unjustifiable tyranny"" in which the police were the ""actual machinery of despotism,"" as he confessed in The Road to Wigan Pier (1937). He came to loathe ""the whole machinery of so-called justice,"" never entering a jail without feeling that his place was on the other side of the bars. The claim that colonialism spread the rule of law was a cover story for theft. He suspected police officers in England were likewise ""haunted by a secret horror of what they do."" Indeed, in England too, modern policing had evolved from an effort to enforce the theft of the commons and suppress the collective values on which they depended in favor of private property and individualistic values. In a 1933 work, Orwell called out the police as the true source of the ""immoral conduct"" that they routinely pinned on the poor to justify their brutality. In Burmese Days, the moral path of the colonizer leads to suicide, anticipating the bleak destiny of the Inner Party member in 1984. Orwell himself, however, escaped and sought redemption from ""bad conscience"" by living several years as a tramp in Paris and London. He wanted to expiate ""an immense weight of guilt"" and determined to ""submerge myself, to get right down among the oppressed, to be one of them and on their side against their tyrants."" The English working class, then struggling with deep poverty and high unemployment during the Depression, struck him as analogous to the Burmese: And among them were preserved the collective values the modern world still needed. For Orwell, at home and abroad, policing and incarceration were the essence of oppression; they thus defined his vision of dystopia in 1984. Cold War Americans liked to read the work as a narrow attack on Stalinism, but its target was far more universal. Policing works by corrupting the soul of both police officers and the policed, destroying human bonds—destroying community, as racism does too. A police officer""s ""normal"" feelings are abject bitterness and moral confusion, Orwell told us in ""Shooting an Elephant"" (1936), an essay routinely assigned in high school English classes: ""With one part of my mind, I thought of the British Raj as an unbreakable tyranny …; with another part I thought that the greatest joy in the world would be to drive a bayonet into a Buddhist priest""s guts."" His experiences in Burma and among the poor turned Eric Blair into a political writer; in taking the pen name George Orwell in 1933, he was partly forging a new self from the moral ruin of his policing life. To the extent that Orwell""s ideas now saturate our common understanding of liberty and threats to it, that understanding is based on a realization of the fundamental immorality of policing. We have always known policing is the problem. Orwell wrote 1984 in 1947–49 (it appeared six months before his death), just as the British Empire was beginning to fall apart and spawn an afterlife at home. Policing methods designed to pacify and invigilate subversives abroad were used to discipline the unemployed, women, and crowds at home, precisely (and not coincidentally) when nonwhite immigration to Britain from its former colonies was increasing. Those immigrants also endured the insult of living among statues of slave traders and brutal conquerors—at last being toppled by their descendants today. For many, including perhaps Orwell himself, the totalitarian world of Big Brother and doublethink was not merely the exotic trajectory of Stalinist Russia but the fate of imperial policing everywhere, including Britain. What could be more Orwellian than the proud display of statues of conquerors and slavers in a society continually protesting imperial innocence and devotion to liberty and equality? ""Ignorance is Strength,"" the Ministry of Truth would say. And, ""War is Peace"": Racist militarized American policing remains part of wider racist policing abroad, often from the skies and in the very regions in which the British first devised such policing tactics. Aerial policing is now being applied to the BLM protests against policing. However much we may try to reform modern policing, its fundamental purpose is social control, which, in unhealed parts of the world that are continually retraumatized by a racist past, cannot but depend on a dynamic of criminalizing particular racial and social groups. Orwell may have felt he ought to be on the other side of the prison bars, but he did not seek penance by surrendering himself to the police or prison for his sins; those institutions had no moral legitimacy. Rather, he felt he would find expiation in understanding and giving voice to an oppressed community. What if all police officers heeded the pangs of conscience as Orwell did? It is time for us too to recover the cooperative values that policing seeks to suppress and find community-based forms of moving forward, of redeeming the past and keeping societies safe and just."
slate|"U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves often weaves the nation""s history of discrimination into his analysis. Reeves, a Black man who writes with trenchant candor about racism in America, was appointed to the Southern District of Mississippi by President Barack Obama in 2010. His Tuesday decision in Jamison v. McClendon, however, is much more than a legal history lesson. It is a fiery protest against the injustices of racist law enforcement wrapped in a scholarly critique of the appalling doctrine that lets lawless cops off the hook. He denounced a legal system that favors unconstitutional policing over Black lives. And then he let the officer off the hook. The doctrine of qualified immunity, which protects police officers from lawsuits over their behavior on the job, has suddenly received massive scrutiny in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd and the ensuing Black Lives Matter protests. Judges have begun to grapple with the courts"" role in expanding the doctrine and its dehumanizing consequences. Some judges are now even listening to the protests in the streets. A federal appeals court cited Floyd""s killing in a June opinion denying qualified immunity, explaining that the doctrine risks letting cops disrespect ""the dignity and worth of black lives."" Reeves has now joined the chorus of judges urging the Supreme Court to acknowledge the ""worth of black lives"" and its complicity in using ""legal jargon"" to cover up systemic racism in law enforcement. The facts in Jamison are depressingly familiar. A white Mississippi officer named Nick McClendon pulled over Clarence Jamison, a Black man driving his new Mercedes convertible. McClendon claimed that Jamison""s temporary tag was ""folded up."" (Later, Jamison provided evidence that the tag was never folded.) McClendon ran a background check but found no criminal history. He then asked Jamison if he could search the Mercedes, allegedly (and falsely) accusing Jamison of carrying 10 kilograms of cocaine. Jamison initially refused the search. But after McClendon asked five times, Jamison acquiesced. The officer proceeded to dismantle Jamison""s car for nearly two hours, searching every inch and finding no contraband. In the process, he destroyed portions of the car, inflicting thousands of dollars"" worth of damage. McClendon also deployed a drug-sniffing dog, who found nothing. Jamison then sued McClendon for violating his Fourth Amendment rights. A federal law passed in the wake of the Civil War lets individuals sue state officers who infringe on their constitutional liberties. But the Supreme Court has hobbled this law by imposing an extra-textual requirement: A victim must prove that the officer violated a ""clearly established"" right ""beyond debate,"" meaning a court has previously found that a nearly identical offense violated the Constitution. If a victim cannot meet this burden, the official receives ""qualified immunity""—a shield against the lawsuit. Reeves ruled that McClendon had flagrantly disregarded the Fourth Amendment by unlawfully coercing Jamison to consent to the search. Yet because there is no precedent ""that places the Constitutional question ""beyond debate,"""" the judge held, McClendon is entitled to qualified immunity, and ""Jamison""s claim cannot proceed."" Reeves pointed out that it would be ""naïve"" to hold otherwise, suggesting that his hands were tied by the higher courts. After all, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hears appeals from Reeves"" court. In 2019, the  5th Circuit granted qualified immunity to prison guards who locked an inmate in a frigid cell covered in feces, forcing him to sleep naked on the floor for six days, because an inmate""s right not to be locked in a feces-covered cell for six days was not ""clearly established."" The 5th Circuit has made clear that it believes even the most transparently abusive officer should be shielded from liability. Rather than issue a decision destined to be reversed by the 5th Circuit, Reeves placed Jamison""s ordeal in the context of Black Americans"" broader struggle for equal justice. His opinion began with a list of Black people who""ve fallen prey to that racism. ""Clarence Jamison wasn""t jaywalking,"" Reeves wrote. ""That was Michael Brown."" ""He wasn""t outside playing with a toy gun. That was 12-year-old Tamir Rice."" ""He didn""t look like a ""suspicious person."" That was Elijah McClain."" ""He wasn""t suspected of ""selling loose, untaxed cigarettes."" That was Eric Garner."" ""He wasn""t suspected of passing a counterfeit $20 bill. That was George Floyd."" ""He didn""t look like anyone suspected of a crime. That was Philando Castile and Tony McDade."" And on Reeves went, citing police assaults on nearly two dozen Black people over the last few years. ""Thankfully, Jamison left the stop with his life,"" he noted. ""Too many others have not. … Tragically, thousands have died at the hands of law enforcement over the years, and the death toll continues to rise. Countless more have suffered from other forms of abuse and misconduct by police."" Reeves then embarked upon a powerful condemnation of qualified immunity. ""The harm in this case to one man,"" he wrote, ""sheds light on the harm done to the nation by this manufactured doctrine."" He explained that, during Reconstruction, white Southerners—including law enforcement—tortured and murdered formerly enslaved people to reestablish their brutal racial caste. To end this campaign of ""racial terror,"" Congress passed the Ku Klux Klan Act, the basis of civil rights suits like Jamison""s. Sadly, federal courts promptly ""decided to place their hand on the scale for white supremacy,"" gutting the federal government""s efforts to protect black Americans from both vigilante and state-sponsored violence. That trend continues today in the form of qualified immunity. The Supreme Court has made it almost impossible for victims of police misconduct to sue their tormentors in federal court. Federal judges were intended to be ""guardians of the people""s federal rights,"" yet they have transformed into enablers of system racism and abuse at the hands of the police. Reviewing recent qualified immunity decisions, Reeves noted: With a historian""s eye, Reeves demonstrated that these decisions are not anomalies. They are part of the federal judiciary""s long, dispiriting history of ""slamming shut the courthouse doors"" on the most vulnerable, particularly Black Americans. The Supreme Court has corrected such injustices in the past. It outlawed school segregation in Brown v. Board of Education. And just this year, it abolished non-unanimous jury verdicts, a tradition rooted in bigotry. ""Just as the Supreme Court swept away the mistaken doctrine of ""separate but equal,"" "" Reeves concluded, ""so too should it eliminate the doctrine of qualified immunity."" The Supreme Court declined to reconsider qualified immunity just two months ago. Opponents of the doctrine have a tortuous road ahead, but Reeves encouraged them to strike forward anyway. ""As people marching in the streets remind us today, some have always stood up to face our nation""s failings,"" Reeves wrote, alluding to the Black Lives Matter movement. ""Through their efforts we become ever more perfect."" For more of Slate""s news coverage, subscribe to What Next on Apple Podcasts or listen below."
bipartisan_report|"There is a gigantic mural painted in front of Donald Trump""s primary New York residAll Postsence and office Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, according to The Forbes Magazine. It looks just like the one that the group Black Lives Matter painted on the newly-named street Black Lives Matter Plaza that deadends at the White House in DC. The New York group of painters thoughtfully painted their mural so that when the president is in residence, he can read it right from his windows. Four groups of protesters cross-clashed as tempers flared.    Unfortunately, pro-Trump MAGA people got into it with anti-Trump protesters right at that mural on Saturday. It had been just days since the Black Lives Matter group painted the mural, but that was not the only brawl. About 400 people supporting the New York Police Department (NYPD) were protesting what they felt was defunding and disrespecting local forces. A multi-racial small group of Black Lives Matter counter-demonstrators met up with the mostly white protesters. The New York Post called the New York fracas a ""Blue Live Brawl."" Anti-cop protesters met up with a Blue Lives Matter rally and altercations ensued with shouting, pushing, shoving, and finger-pointing. The two groups were furious. The pro-NYPD protesters escalated the situation against the anti-cop protesters who were carrying Black Lives Matter signs. Lou Gentile, an Army vet came from Staten Island in a three-bus caravan to protest. He said: ""I HAD TO BE HERE TO DEFEND MY POLICE – DEFEND THEM AND TO SHOW THAT I""M IN TOTAL SUPPORT OF THEM. THEY RISK THEIR LIVES EVERY DAY FOR US. WHEN THEY PUT THAT GUN ON AND THAT UNIFORM, THEY RISK THEIR LIVES. WHEN YOU CALL THEM, WHO""S GOING TO COME? A SOCIAL WORKER? I DON""T THINK SO. WHO""S GOING TO COME? HIM, HIM AND HIM.TO PROTECT YOUR LIFE."" A man behind the NYPD officers yelled at the Black Live Matter group: ""THE BLUE LIVES MATTER MARCH – THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A BLUE LIFE, IT""S A BLUE SHIRT. THEY SEEM TO THINK THAT BLACK LIVES MATTER IS A PERSONAL ATTACK ON THEM, ON THEIR WHITE LIVES AND THE POLICE, BUT WHAT WE WANT IS EQUALITY. WE WANT FAIR TREATMENT UNDER THE LAW AND THE POLICE HAS SHOWN THAT THEY CAN NOT DO THAT."" Pro-cop protestor and teacher Natalia Vroublebski defended her local police. She said that the anti-cop rallies were not fair: ""IT""S NOT FAIR TO THEM. WE NEED THEM,  WE ARE SEEING THE CRIME GOES UP AND IT""S NOT GOOD AND WE NEED THEM. THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE CUT THEIR BUDGET. I DON""T AGREE WITH THAT."" One pro-cop protester and union plumber only gave his first name, Anthony, as he waved a Trump/Pence 2020 flag. He said: ""TRUMP, OUR PRESIDENT, IS FOR LAW AND ORDER TO KEEP ALL OF US SAFE — ME, YOU, EVERYBODY NEEDS TO BE, BE KEPT SAFE BY THE NYPD OR ANY POLICE. YOU CAN""T SAY ALL COPS ARE BAD BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT. THE ONES THAT ARE BAD THEY SHOULD BE REMOVED. He added ""it""s really hard to keep us safe:"" YOU ARE TAKING AWAY OUR COPS FROM THE STREETS AND THESE UNDERCOVER COPS THAT DO THEIR JOB – AND IT""S REALLY HARD TO KEEP US SAFE – THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE IN THE MOST JEOPARDY AND IT YOU TAKE THEM AWAY, IT""S GOING TO TAKE AWAY FROM US AT THE END OF THE DAY. ""EVERYBODY DESERVES THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM MY SPEAK. THEY HAVE THEIR RIGHT TO PROTEST AS WELL."" Then, the plumber ended with: ""EVERYBODY BLACK LIVES MATTER SUPPORTERS DESERVES THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM MY SPEAK. THEY HAVE THEIR RIGHT TO PROTEST AS WELL."" Thousands of protesters joined in a pro-cop march in Queens, along the boardwalk in Rockaway Beach. Many of them held American flags and flags reading ""God Bless the NYPD."" To prevent a Black Lives Matter group confrontation, the two groups were separated. Pro-cop protesters said that the police needed the support of the community at this time above all the rest. Local Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis and former police officer Marty Golden, and the family of the police officer who was killed Russel Timoshenko, 23, in 2007. Right before noon, dozens of anti-cop protesters appeared at the corner of 13th Avenue and Bay Ridge Avenue in Dyker Heights in Brooklyn. The pro-police group was made up of predominately white people. First, the shouts began, then at least one fight started, which was begun by the pro-cop group. Pro-cop protesters yelled: ""YOU ARE F—ING COMMUNISTS. GO TO VENEZUELA."" An elderly pro-cop protester tried to start a fight, but there were no arrests in that situation. The anti-cop protesters were barred from joining the rally as it marched up 13th Avenue. No arrests were reported. Not all of the action was in New York. Protesters against the LA (Los Angeles) Sheriff""s Department gathered on Saturday. At the same time, about 100 pro-LA Police Department (LAPD) protesters rallied in support of the police in downtown LA.

bipartisan_report|"With polls consistently showing Donald Trump well behind his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, in the 2020 presidential elections, the president is desperate to convince his base that he""s focused and handling the country""s problems. His main goal seems to be protecting statues of Confederate soldiers, which addresses exactly none of the country""s actual problems.  It was so remarkable that Trump agreed to cancel a golf trip to Bedminster, New Jersey during a new rise in COVID-19 cases, with unemployment at its highest since the Great Depression, and with Americans crying out for policy changes toward racial equality that he felt the need to announce it. Of course, his explanation for the cancelled trip is untrue. New Jersey has a new order mandating that visitors to their state quarantine themselves for at least 14 days upon arrival, an order that the mayor said Trump was exempt from, but the optics of going there without being quarantined is a bad look. Of course, so is golfing at a time like this. Trump is still touting his false claims that mail-in voting will cause massive voter fraud and lose him the 2020 election. Since the fraud claim is untrue, he makes it fairly obvious that he""s more afraid that if more voters have access to the polls, they""ll likely vote against him.

bipartisan_report|"Judge Jeanine Pirro appeared on Fox News last week and railed into Black Lives Matter, claiming that the movement is based on something that is ""not true."" She began by putting down the shooting deaths of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida, and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri as effectively inconsequential. Pirro defended Martin""s killer, George Zimmerman, noting that he was acquitted, while refusing to note the continued history of legal trouble in which Zimmerman has found himself. Zimmerman was acquitted, but that doesn""t erase the fact that to defend him is morally questionable at best. Pirro went on to similarly defend Brown""s killer, Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. She correctly noted that no case against Wilson ever gained traction, but Pirro did not note that a Federal Justice Department Investigation into the policies and procedures of the Ferguson police department found ample evidence of deeply embedded racial bias against African Americans. All of this, Pirro said, shows that Black Lives Matter is ""based on a lie."" So Black lives don""t actually matter, according to Pirro? That sickening statement certainly shone through Pirro""s tirade, playing into the anti-immigrant and anti-foreigner fears stoked by Donald Trump among right wing voters. Besides, the actual basis for the movement claimed by its members is undeniably true. Investigation after investigation has found a deeply set bias against African Americans in police departments across the United States of America. Sure, African American citizens of the United States are as American as Caucasian Americans and Hispanic Americans. The problem is that such is the case in the world of everyone but those who think like Pirro, who will likely be voting for sexual predator turned presidential candidate Donald Trump. Pirro rambled on, saying: ""AS A PROSECUTOR, I PROSECUTED CASES OF COPS NOT DOING THEIR JOBS, BUT THERE IS A SOCIAL CONTRACT IN THIS COUNTRY, AND WE HAVE VIGILANTE JUSTICE IF WE DON""T FOLLOW IT, THAT MEANS, THE POLICE DO THEIR JOB, YOU DON""T LIKE WHAT THEY DO, YOU GO OUT AND MAKE A COMPLAINT. YOU DON""T GO OUT AND KILL COPS LIKE 5 IN DALLAS BECAUSE THEY ARE WHITE."" Huh? So according to Pirro, were the cops killed in Dallas on account of their race or on account of their occupation? Additionally, as others have noted, the killer responsible for the massacre of Dallas cops was black, and that was the extent of his association with Black Lives Matter. The truth is that he was a mentally ill combat veteran who was triggered into the killing by the tensions surrounding him — stoked by fake race war instigators like Pirro. To assert otherwise is, to start, a grave injustice to the multitudes of American combat veterans suffering from mental illness who languish every day on the streets of the United States.

bipartisan_report|"With all the tension between police forces and Black Lives Matter protesters, both the movement and police departments have had their hands full trying to keep things peaceful. Many police officers are taking the protests as a threat, but Wichita, Kansas police chief Gordon Ramsay decided to mirror his U.K. TV namesake and discuss matters over something that everyone can agree on: food. Black Lives Matter held a large demonstration in Wichita last Tuesday, July 12, with hundreds of protesters blocking a ramp to an important thoroughfare in the Midwestern city. The protest was peaceful, if loud, and local police did not interfere with citizens exercising their rights. https://youtu.be/r4IpX-YWYvk As reported on local TV station KAKE, Police Chief Ramsay met with the protesters the following day to figure out how to rectify the situation and address their concerns. Chief Ramsay invited BLM leaders to police headquarters to discuss how to move forward. Chief Ramsay met with the press afterward and spoke about the vast array of issues faced by the protesters. He seemed to understand at an impressive level how the effects of poverty, racism, and profiling meet to increase tensions. Ramsay identified the need to hire officers from within the community and approved by the community. He also recognized how current operating methods exacerbate conflict between the police and citizens and noted that the increase in gun violence has affected how the police operate. Local Black Lives Matter leaders were impressed with the thoughtful response of their police chief and cancelled their plans for another protest. Instead, the BLM organizers and Wichita police decided to throw a community cookout to improve the relationship between the police and citizens. Approximately 1,000 people showed up for the First Steps Cookout, where there were speeches by community leaders and a Q&A session with police. The event was broadcast on Facebook Live for those who could not attend. The Wichita Eagle also reported on the event, saying that it drew attendees of all races and ages from the community. Black, Hispanic, and white community members sat with police officers and discussed ideas for enhancing community policing and cooperation. Several attendees noted that this was the first time in years — or ever — that they""d had a chance to talk with police about improving relationships between the people and the department.

WNBA players decided to wear the shirts as a way to make a political statement and show solidarity following the murders of Philando Castile, Alton Sterling, and the five police officers from Dallas, Texas.

bipartisan_report|"George Zimmerman was heavily criticized recently for auctioning off the gun that he used to kill Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman allegedly sold the gun on UnitedGunGroup for $250,000. Several other auction sites had refused the sale on ethical grounds. The original listing had to be removed due to fake buyers, with names such as ""Racist McShootFace,"" driving up the price as high as $65 million. Despite the scorn he received for selling the weapon he used to kill a 17-year-old boy, Zimmerman does not seem to regret his actions. In fact, according to an interview, Zimmerman has said he is proud of the sale and claimed it was inspired by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton""s supposed anti-gun rhetoric. Zimmerman said ""She has been stumping around for a false campaign for the Trayvon Martin Foundation. She lied saying that I killed him when he was walking home in his daddy""s neighborhood. Which if anyone watched more than seven minutes of the trial they would know that is false."" Zimmerman went on to claim that he would do anything he could think of to ensure that Clinton does not become President and ""turn the greatest country in the world into a communist territory."" Clinton wasn""t the only political figure mentioned in the interview. He also claimed that President Barack Obama and former Attorney General Eric Holder are ""racists"" who are out to get him. Not content to merely call the President a racist and claim Clinton wants to turn the U.S. into some kind of communist dictatorship, Zimmerman went on to attack the Black Lives Matter movement as well. In addition to mocking the movement as ""pansies"" and calling them ""Slime Lives Matter,"" he claimed they were responsible for acts of violence against law enforcement and claimed they burned down the city of Baltimore. ""I WANT ALL THE BLACK LIVES ""ACTIVISTS,"" WHICH I THINK ARE JUST ABSOLUTE PANSIES, TO REALIZE THAT ANYBODY AND EVERYBODY THAT THEY TRY AND HURT, ALL THEY""RE DOING IS GUARANTEEING I""M GOING TO STEP IN AND DOING WHATEVER IT TAKES MAKE THEIR  LIVES 10 TIMES BETTER THAN BEFORE THEIR BLACK LIVES MATTER CAMPAIGN."" The ""people they try and hurt"" that Zimmerman was talking about were law enforcement personnel, though he offered no concrete evidence to support his claims against the movement.

bipartisan_report|"Somebody should be arrested. Not just some random person, though. Taking a treacherous leap into the raging river of Alex Jones""s Info Wars sure makes one uneasy — over him, not the fluffy fairy tales he is spouting. One of his show""s latest guests was ""discussing"" with Jones about how Black Lives Matter protestors are really radical Islamists who are also in Egypt and ""overthrew our ally there."" And, just when you thought it couldn""t get any worse, this man and Jones agreed that ""community defense forces"" should continue to be set up to ""combat"" in war in the streets with these global Black Lives Matter jihadists in the near future. Those weren""t the only detached from reality things that he said. This guest, Stewart Rhodes, also claimed, among other things, that Bernie Sanders is an ""honest Communist"" and the Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law Center are ""espionage groups."" It goes without saying that these two organizations have a record of working for human rights in America, and, at least in the case of the ADL, around the world. And Bernie Sanders, for the millionth time, is a Democratic Socialist, not a Communist. There is a difference. In the world of these men, all of the previously mentioned fanciful notions aren""t just meaningless chatter. The reason for this potency is that they are calling to set up militias that use some creepy, falsely justifiable violence against people who happen to be perceived to be on the ""other side."" Rhodes founded the domestic terror group the ""Oath Keepers,"" a group that makes it its business to encourage these types of activities among veterans. His perspective can be summed up in these comments that he made on the Alex Jones show: ""WHEN SOMEONE DOES DEFEND THEMSELVES AND THEY GET STOMPED, OF COURSE THEY""LL SCREECH AND CALL THEM ""RACIST"" AND ""FASCIST"" AND ""BROWNSHIRTS"" BUT THEY BROUGHT IT ON THEMSELVES SO I JUST HAVE NO SYMPATHY FOR THEM."" So, in other words, it""s not really his fault that he is clamoring for violence, and he is fighting some magical war to save the universe and those who criticize him just need to forget about it. It""s not only not his fault, but its also not the fault of the veterans and other citizens who are, according to Rhodes, going to be almost animalistically drawn into fighting in the streets. At least his facade can be seen through rather easily. None of his words really mean much of anything besides being an attempt to assert himself and feel manly. That""s the way it works. Ideas don""t exist apart from people who think of them. And those people drive why the ideas are there in the first place. So, these magical ideas are just a front for these guys to try and sell shirts — which is really how the segment below ended. You can watch the freakshow t-shirt infomercial below.

bipartisan_report|"While attending a rally for Hillary Clinton, The Hill reports, husband Bill found himself having to attempt to defend his 90s crime bill to a group of protesters. During the former President""s speech, protesters criticized Clinton for his support of the 1994 bill. One protester also held a sign that read ""Clinton crime bill destroyed our communities."" Rather than maintaining presidential decorum, Clinton engaged with the protesters, arguing about the ways his bill benefited black communities. He told the protesters, ""You are defending the people who killed the lives you say matter. Tell the truth."" He continued, ""See these other signs? I don""t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year olds hopped on crack and sent them out in the street to murder other African-American children. Maybe you thought they were good citizens. Hillary didn""t."" Describing the protesters, who were understandably relentless in their criticism, he said, ""I listened to them. They don""t want to listen to me. You never learn anything when you are talking. You can trust them, or you can trust Congressman John Lewis, one of the last remaining heroes of the civil rights movement."" This is not the first time a Clinton has been accosted by Black Lives Matter protesters. In February, Ashley Williams and a colleague were escorted from a Clinton fundraiser, which they each paid $500 to attend. During the fundraiser, Williams held a sign reading ""We have to bring them to heel. #WhichHillary?"" and demanded that Clinton apologize for mass incarceration. Williams"" sign was a reference to Clinton""s comments regarding the people the bill was targeting: ""We need to take these people on. They are often connected to big drug cartels. They are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called ""super-predators. No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel."" The Clintons are beginning to become known for their disregard for protesters in general and Black Lives Matter protesters specifically.

tpm|"Fox News host Sean Hannity seized on the mass shooting at a Colorado supermarket on Monday to undermine protests last summer that raised a banner for racial justice. ""Obviously very scary, horrific shooting in Boulder,"" Hannity said, hours after at least ten people including a police officer, were killed on Monday in an attack at a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado, according to authorities. But the horror of the deadly Colorado shooting, which came just days after a suspected Georgia man shot and killed 8 people, including 6 women of Asian-descent in Atlanta-run spas, quickly turned to an attack on protests from last summer opposing police brutality that Republicans have claimed as a diversion tactic to avoid addressing a fresh wave of calls for gun reform. ""You know, we""re often reminded and then we forget. Remember, ""What do we want? Dead cops. When do we want them, now. Pigs in a blanket. Fry them like bacon."" Bottles, rocks, bricks, molotov cocktails. They""re not riots we were told all summer to over 2,500 cops injured but these are the cops that go put themselves in harms way and in this case we lost one tonight,"" Hannity said. After invoking last summer""s protests, the Fox News host invited frequent guest Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and New York Police Department officer, to join in on bashing those who have called for police reform in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police last May. ""Yeah, Sean, don""t forget with this defund the police crowd, that wasn""t a social worker that walked in there,"" Bongino said, appearing to reinforce law enforcement who secured the area during the attack. ""Everybody else is racing to get the hell out of there,"" Hannity chimed in. ""They""re going up in the other direction. And now we""re going to defund the police, disparage the police, quiet all summer long as they""re hit with rocks, and bricks, and bottles, and molotov cocktails."" The comments, characterizing last summer""s protests as a riotous mess of thrown bricks and an effort to do away with police, comes after Republicans have sought to portray Democrats as a threat to the very existence of law enforcement. That effort, to paint Democrats as a menacing force angling to gut funding to police, comes as House Republicans last week voted against a resolution to award Congressional Gold Medals to honor the officers who risked their lives to defend the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6."
tpm|"The leader of the right-wing street gang the Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, was arrested Monday in Washington, D.C., the Metropolitan Police Department confirmed to TPM. Tarrio was arrested on a destruction of property charge related to a Dec. 12 offense, MPD spokesperson Sean Hickman said. The New York Times reported that the specific destruction of property charge stemmed from the burning of a historically Black church""s Black Lives Matter banner during a pro-Trump protest in D.C., for which Tarrio subsequently claimed credit online. ""So let me make this simple,"" he wrote last month. ""I did it."" At the time Tarrio""s arrest, he also allegedly possessed two high capacity firearm magazines, Hickman told TPM. ""He was additionally charged with Possession of High Capacity Feeding Device,"" Hickman said.

""We believe Enrique has been arrested once he got to DC,"" the prominent Proud Boy Joe Biggs wrote around the same time on Parler in response to the arrest. ""The left can burn right wing people""s flags, signs and banners and nothing happens. One or too sic black supremacist signs get burnt and it""s game over. This country is beyond fucked,"" Biggs added separately. Tarrio was expected in D.C. this week for a pro-Trump protest.

Tarrio claimed credit for burning Asbury United Methodist Church""s banner, but he and other unidentified Proud Boys were also sued Monday by Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church over that church""s burned banner."
tpm|"A poll worker in Memphis, Tennessee, was fired last week after turning away early voters who were wearing ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""I Can""t Breathe"" shirts, an elections official said Monday. The worker was let go after officials received a call from a witness at the Dave Wells Community Center polling station, Shelby County Election Commission spokeswoman Suzanne Thompson told the Associated Press. The North Memphis poll worker had asked at least one early voter on Friday to turn a shirt with a message related to the racial justice movement inside-out, the election commission said, according to CBS affiliate WREG-TV. The Shelby County Election Commission did not immediately respond to TPM""s requests for comment. Elections administrator Linda Phillips told the local station that the fired poll worker had been repeatedly made aware of the rules. ""He was given very clear instructions. He was given clear instructions the next day, and again didn""t pay attention to them. So he was terminated."" Phillips told AP. While it""s a matter of protocol for poll workers to ask voters wearing a shirt with the name of a political candidate or party to turn it inside-out when inside the polling place, the policy wouldn""t have applied to a Black Lives Matter t-shirt. Moreover, state law does not ban voters from donning clothing bearing statements such as ""Black Lives Matter,"" Thompson told AP. The number of voters who were told to leave was not immediately known, Thompson said, suggesting to AP it had been a few. Thompson noted that the poll worker had believed the statements were tied to the Democratic Party. ""That was pretty bad,"" she said. ""They were not supposed to be turned away."" President Donald Trump has often sought to paint Black Lives Matter as a dangerous movement with deep ties to ""antifa"" — which he has designated as a ""terrorist organization"" — blaming it for stirring violence amid protests against racial injustice and police brutality. Attorney General William Barr has echoed those sentiments, claiming groups using ""antifa-like tactics"" had incited violence in Minneapolis after the police killing of George Floyd. The comments, tying the movement for racial justice in recent months with antifa and what Trump has called the ""radical left,"" appear to contradict those made by FBI Director Christopher Wray, who testified before Congress last month, saying that antifa is more akin to an ideology or movement than a singular organization."
tpm|"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — One person was shot and killed late Saturday in Portland, Oregon, as a large caravan of President Donald Trump supporters and Black Lives Matter protesters clashed in the streets, police said. It wasn""t clear if the shooting was linked to fights that broke out as a caravan of about 600 vehicles was confronted by counter-demonstrators in the city""s downtown. Police said the caravan had left the area around 8:30 p.m., and officers heard gunshots at about 8:46 p.m., according to a statement. Officers arrived at the shooting scene ""within a minute,"" police said, but the man who was shot did not survive. An Associated Press freelance photographer heard three gunshots and then observed police medics working on the body of the victim, who appeared to be a white man. The freelancer said the man was wearing a hat bearing the insignia of Patriot Prayer, a right-wing group whose members have frequently clashed with protesters in Portland in the past. Police said the man was shot in the chest. He was not immediately identified. It""s unclear who shot him. Homicide detectives were looking for more evidence, acknowledging that several images and videos had been posted on social media. ""It is important for detectives get a full and accurate picture of what happened before, during, and after the shooting,"" a police statement said. ""If anyone was a witness, has video, or has information about the homicide, they""re asked to contact the primary detectives."" ""This violence is completely unacceptable and we are working diligently to find and apprehend the individual or individuals responsible,"" Chief Chuck Lovell said. Portland has been the site of nightly protests for more than three months since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Many of them end in vandalism and violence, and hundreds of demonstrators have been arrested by local and federal law enforcement since late May. In the two hours following the shooting, protesters gathered downtown and there was sporadic fighting and vandalism, police stated. Some gave speeches in Lownsdale Square Park before the protest petered out. Ten people were arrested, police said. The caravan had arrived downtown just as a protest planned for Saturday was getting underway. The chaotic scene came two days after Trump invoked Portland as a liberal city overrun with violence in a speech at the Republican National Convention as part of his ""law and order"" re-election campaign theme. The caravan marked the third Saturday in a row that Trump supporters have rallied in the city. Trump and other speakers at last week""s convention evoked a violent, dystopian future if Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden wins in November and pointed to Portland as a cautionary tale for what would be in store for Americans. The pro-Trump rally""s organizer, who recently coordinated a similar caravan in Boise, Idaho, said in a video posted on Twitter Saturday afternoon that attendees should only carry concealed weapons and the route was being kept secret for safety reasons. The caravan had gathered earlier in the day at a suburban mall and drove as a group to the heart of Portland. As they arrived in the city, protesters attempted to stop them by standing in the street and blocking bridges. Videos from the scene showed sporadic fighting, as well as Trump supporters firing paintball pellets at opponents and using bear spray as counter-protesters threw things at the Trump caravan. The Black Lives Matter demonstrations usually target police buildings and federal buildings. Some protesters have called for reductions in police budgets while the city""s mayor and some in the Black community have decried the violence, saying it""s counterproductive. Early Saturday morning, fires set outside a police union building that is a frequent site for protests prompted police to declare a riot. An accelerant was used to ignite a mattress and other debris that was laid against the door of the Portland Police Association building, police said in a statement. At least one dumpster had also been set on fire in the street nearby. The commotion followed a sit-in in the lobby of the Portland mayor""s condominium building Friday night."
tpm|"An activist marching in a group from Milwaukee to Washington, D.C. was shot late Monday night, resulting in non-life-threatening injuries, but no charges yet. The shooting, which appeared to be captured in a Facebook Live video stream, occurred less than 20 minutes after a property owner called the police to complain that the activist group was in a private business parking lot in Juniata Township, Pennsylvania, state police told reporters. ""The property owners confronted the activists,"" state police spokesperson Brent Miller told reporters at a press briefing. ""The confrontation escalated and gun shots were exchanged between the property owners and the activists."" Neither the victim nor any alleged shooters have been identified by authorities. Police said they recovered two guns at the scene that had both been fired, a shotgun and a handgun, but they did not answer questions about whether anyone in the activist group had fired a weapon, nor whether both weapons had been fired by the property owners. ""It would be inappropriate to make a determination, or a prosecutorial decision, with the information we have at this point,"" Bedford County District Attorney Lesley Childers-Potts said at Tuesday""s press briefing. One activist marching with the group, Frank Nitty, captured a confrontation on a Facebook Live stream. At one point after the first shots ring out, Nitty zooms in on two men, one of whom appears to be holding a gun. ""We""re leaving!"" someone is heard shouting shortly before the shooting picks up again. Nitty""s footage then shows a bloodied man being driven away. In another video Tuesday, Nitty said the activist group was shot out of nowhere. ""We start walking, and basically we heard a gun shot, a loud bang,"" he said. For a moment, Nitty recalled, the activist group wasn""t sure what the noise was. ""Then we heard another loud bang, and we were like, ""Somebody""s shooting at us."""" Nitty said the men yelled racial slurs at the activists and told them, ""Don""t come through our town."" No one has been charged yet in the shooting, but police said the property owners had been questioned and that charges could be forthcoming."

According to the Associated Press, St. Louis circuit attorney Kim Gardner""s announcement of the charges against the St. Louis couple, who are both personal injury attorneys, included a misdemeanor charge of fourth-degree assault. Gardner told the AP before her official announcement of the charges against the St. Louis couple that their actions during the peaceful protest that occurred outside their home risked creating a violent situation. ""It is illegal to wave weapons in a threatening manner — that is unlawful in the city of St. Louis,"" Gardner told the AP. Gardner is recommending a diversion program instead of jail time for the St. Louis couple if convicted, according to the AP. The attorney for the McCloskeys, Joel Schwartz, told the AP in a statement that he finds the charges ""disheartening as I unequivocally believe no crime was committed."" The filing of charges against the St. Louis couple comes a few days after Missouri Gov. Mike Parson suggested that he would pardon them if convicted during an interview with local radio host Marc Cox. President Trump previously attacked Gardner""s probe of the St. Louis couple, which he characterized as a ""disgrace."" After Parson claimed that Trump would be getting involved in the case, Al Watkins, one of the McCloskey""s lawyers, told TPM last week that he has been in talks with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows."

On Thursday morning, New York 1 News reporter Lindsay Tuchman tweeted that the city had shut down the street in preparation of the project.  Local NBC News affiliate News 4 New York reported on Wednesday night that city workers would begin painting the mural the following morning. Trump, who has thrown his support behind the police amid recent protests against anti-Black police brutality, had bashed the project on Twitter last week by claiming a Black Lives Matter sign was a ""symbol of hate"" and that painting it on the upscale street will ""antagonize New York""s Finest."" ""Maybe our GREAT Police, who have been neutralized and scorned by a mayor who hates and disrespects them, won""t let this symbol of hate be affixed to New York""s greatest street,"" he tweeted.

tpm|"President Trump criticized New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday for the second-term mayor""s decision to cut roughly $1 billion from the city""s police department budget.

Spend this money fighting crime instead! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 1, 2020  In tweets, the President called the installation of a street painting reading ""Black Lives Matter"" — a phrase associated with a movement of the same name — ""a symbol of hate."" The BLM movement has condemned racism and police violence in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis over Memorial Day weekend. Trump also suggested that the sign reflected the mayor""s disrespect for the police. The move to pit police against a movement for racial justice is the latest in the president""s continued attempts at putting his reelection at the center of a culture war that demonizes the nation""s reckoning with racial inequality. Ironically, de Blasio was the subject of faltering enthusiasm last month among former supporters who criticized his response to anti-racism protests which yielded many instances of police violence against largely peaceful demonstrators. In a press conference on Tuesday, the mayor called the trimming of one-sixth of the NYPD""s $6 billion budget a ""balancing act."" It will involve the cancellations of plans to hire roughly 1,160 officers in July.  It will also shift officers away from school safety and away from policing illegal vendors and homeless people on the street. In spite of the cuts, the New York Times reported that a fall class of officers is still expected to begin training in October. That fact has upset some lawmakers who have noted that a hiring freeze by the city for some others —  including teachers — will remain in place for the next year. ""Defunding police means defunding police,"" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said in a statement on Monday, criticizing the mayor for using ""budget tricks"" and ""funny math"" that moves police officers from one city budget to the next. The mayor told MSNBC""s Joe Scarborough in an interview on Wednesday that the ""Black Lives Matter"" sign could help the President, who just days ago retweeted a video that included a man crying ""white power,"" grasp a message ""that he still doesn""t understand."" ""Maybe seeing it outside of his doorstep will help him get the point,"" de Blasio said."

The vice president described Floyd""s death as a ""tragedy,"" then dodged Taff""s question.

The anchor pointed out the importance of recognizing Black lives specifically given how it was uniquely anti-Black systemic racism that led to the killings of Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and other African-American victims of violent policing.

Upon the removal of the banners on Monday, the embassy told Bloomberg that U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Harry Harris did not intend ""to support or encourage donations to any specific organization"" and that he ordered the removal of the ""Black Lives Matter"" banner ""to avoid the misperception that American taxpayer dollars were spent to benefit such organizations.""

cnbc|"Salesforce has said before that Black lives matter, but a message posted to the software company""s LinkedIn account last Friday expressed the sentiment about racial equality more vigorously than usual. ""Hey everybody, we just want you to know what while CPAC is going on, BLACK LIVES STILL F-----G MATTER. PEACE,"" read a post on Salesforce""s account, which has more than 2 million followers. (Last week, conservatives gathered in Florida to attend the annual Conservative Political Action Conference.) The post has since been deleted. The incident highlights the challenges that minorities have faced inside Salesforce and other technology companies that have sought to boost diversity. ""Last Friday, we became aware of unauthorized access to one of our social media accounts. We took quick action and secured it,"" a Salesforce spokesperson told CNBC in an email on Wednesday. The spokesperson didn""t comment on the content of the LinkedIn post but did point to a February blog post showing the status of diversity efforts. As of November, 3.4% of Salesforce employees in the U.S. were Black, up from 2.8% in November 2018, according to the company""s diversity reports. Black people represented 12.8% of the U.S. population in 2019, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate based on the American Community Survey. In recent weeks, two Black people have come forward to talk about their struggles working at Salesforce. Cynthia Perry, a senior manager who worked on design research, said in the resignation letter she posted on LinkedIn that she had ""been gaslit, manipulated, bullied, neglected and mostly unsupported"" as a Salesforce employee. Vivianne Castillo, who had been a manager for design research and innovation, posted her resignation letter on LinkedIn as well, saying she was regularly asked to help with internal diversity, equity and inclusion efforts for free on top of her work. Castillo alluded to miners sending canaries into coal mines to check for safety risks before going in. ""I""ve grown tired of watching the canaries of underrepresented minorities leave Salesforce, only to watch Salesforce ramp up their efforts to throw more canaries into the culture that caused the previous ones to leave or worse -- suffer in silence."" In July, following protests of the killing of George Floyd while in police custody, Salesforce said it hoped to increase the number of Black employees in the U.S. by 50% by the end of 2023. Other companies also want to hire more Black workers, although not every effort is a smash hit. CNBC reported last month on issues that Black college students encountered while going through Google""s Howard West program, including discriminatory treatment from Google employees, with fewer participants than planned. After Salesforce""s LinkedIn account published the message on Friday, hundreds reacted with emojis such as the thumbs up and heart, and some users left comments. ""Ohanaaaaa,"" one Salesforce employee wrote, using the Hawaiian word for family, which Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff regularly uses. ""Yessss! You""re part of ours,"" the Salesforce account wrote in reply.

""Language,"" another Salesforce employee wrote in response to the original post. ""I""m Salesforce, b----,"" the company account replied. ""You are not,"" the employee wrote back.

Brooklyn Center Police Chief Tim Gannon described the shooting death Sunday of 20-year-old Daunte Wright as ""an accidental discharge."" It happened as police were trying to arrest Wright on an outstanding warrant. The shooting sparked violent protests in a metropolitan area already on edge because of the trial of the first of four police officers charged in George Floyd""s death. ""I""ll Tase you! I""ll Tase you! Taser! Taser! Taser!"" the officer is heard shouting on her bodycam footage released at a news conference. She draws her weapon after the man breaks free from police outside his car and gets back behind the wheel. After firing a single shot from her handgun, the car speeds away, and the officer is heard saying, ""Holy (expletive)! I shot him."" President Joe Biden urged calm on Monday, following a night where officers in riot gear clashed with demonstrators. The president said he watched the body camera footage. ""We do know that the anger, pain and trauma amidst the Black community is real,"" Biden said from the Oval Office. But, he added, that ""does not justify violence and looting."" The governor instituted another dusk-to-dawn curfew, and law enforcement agencies stepped up their presence across the Minneapolis area. The number of Minnesota National Guard troops was expected to more than double to over 1,000 by Monday night. While dozens of officers in riot gear and troops guarded the Brooklyn Center police station, more than 100 protesters chanted Wright""s name and hoisted signs that read ""Why did Daunte die?"" and ""Don""t shoot."" Some passing cars flew Black Lives Matter flags out of their windows and honked in support. Organizers from the Movement for Black Lives, a national coalition of more than 150 Black-led political and advocacy groups, pointed to Wright""s killing as yet another reason why cities must take up proposals for defunding an ""irreparably broken, racist system."" Wright ""should not have had his life ripped from him last night. The fact that police killed him just miles from where they murdered George Floyd last year is a slap in the face to an entire community who continues to grieve,"" said Karissa Lewis, the coalition""s national field director. Gannon said at a news conference that the officer made a mistake, and he released the body camera footage less than 24 hours after the shooting. The footage showed three officers around a stopped car, which authorities said was pulled over because it had expired registration tags. When another officer attempts to handcuff Wright, a second officer tells Wright he""s being arrested on a warrant. That""s when the struggle begins, followed by the shooting. Then the car travels several blocks before striking another vehicle. ""As I watch the video and listen to the officer""s command, it is my belief that the officer had the intention to deploy their Taser but instead shot Mr. Wright with a single bullet,"" Gannon said. ""This appears to me from what I viewed and the officer""s reaction in distress immediately after that this was an accidental discharge that resulted in the tragic death of Mr. Wright."" A female passenger sustained non-life-threatening injuries during the crash, authorities said. Katie Wright said that passenger was her son""s girlfriend. The state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was investigating. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said any decision on charges against the officer will be made by the Washington County attorney under an agreement adopted last year by several county prosecutors aimed at avoiding conflicts of interest. Freeman has been frequently criticized by activists in Minneapolis over his charging decisions involving deadly use of force by police. Gannon would not name the officer or provide any other details about her, including her race, other than describing her as ""very senior."" He would not say whether she would be fired following the investigation. ""I think we can watch the video and ascertain whether she will be returning,"" the chief said. Court records show Wright was being sought after failing to appear in court on charges that he fled from officers and possessed a gun without a permit during an encounter with Minneapolis police in June. In that case, a statement of probable cause said police got a call about a man waving a gun who was later identified as Wright."" Wright""s mother, Katie Wright, said her son called her as he was getting pulled over. ""All he did was have air fresheners in the car, and they told him to get out of the car,"" Wright said. During the call, she said she heard scuffling and then someone saying ""Daunte, don""t run"" before the call ended. When she called back, her son""s girlfriend answered and said he had been shot. Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott called the shooting ""deeply tragic."" ""We""re going to do everything we can to ensure that justice is done and our communities are made whole,"" he said. Elliott later announced that the city council had voted to give his office ""command authority"" over the police department. This ""will streamline things and establish a chain of command and leadership,"" he wrote on Twitter. He also said the city manager had been fired, and that the deputy city manager would be taking over his roles. According to the city""s charter, the city manager has control of the police department. Now-former City Manager Curt Boganey, speaking earlier Monday to reporters, said the officer who shot Wright would get ""due process."" Wright""s family hired civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represented the Floyd family in its $27 million settlement with the city of Minneapolis. ""This level of lethal force was entirely preventable and inhumane,"" Crump said in a statement. ""What will it take for law enforcement to stop killing people of color?"" Speaking before the unrest Sunday night, Wright""s mother urged protesters in Brooklyn Center, a city of about 30,000 people on the northwest border of Minneapolis, to stay peaceful and focused on the loss of her son. Biden referred to her comments on Monday, saying ""we should listen to Daunte""s mom calling for peace and calm."" The president said he had not yet called the family but that his prayers were with them. Shortly after the shooting, demonstrators began to gather, with some jumping atop police cars. Marchers also descended on the Brooklyn Center Police Department, where rocks and other objects were thrown at officers. About 20 businesses were broken into at the city""s Shingle Creek shopping center, authorities said. To guard against more unrest, authorities accelerated security measures planned for when the Floyd case goes to the jury. Gov. Tim Walz warned anyone who chooses to ""exploit these tragedies"" with violence ""can rest assured that the largest police presence in Minnesota history"" will be prepared to arrest law breakers. At least a half-dozen businesses began boarding up their windows along Minneapolis"" Lake Street, the scene of some of the most intense violence after Floyd""s death. National Guard vehicles were deployed to a few major intersections, and a handful of soldiers in camouflage, some carrying assault-style weapons, could also be seen. Several professional sports teams in Minneapolis called off games because of safety concerns. The trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis officer charged in Floyd""s death, continued Monday. Floyd, a Black man, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd""s neck. Prosecutors say Floyd was pinned for 9 minutes, 29 seconds. The judge in that case refused Monday to sequester the jury after a defense attorney argued that the panel could be influenced by the prospect of what might happen as a result of their verdict."
cnbc|"Target said it will hire more Black-owned companies, launch a program to identify and support promising minority entrepreneurs and add products from more than 500 Black-owned brands to its shelves or website. Altogether, the discounter said Wednesday, it will spend more than $2 billion with Black-owned businesses by 2025. ""We have a rich history of working with diverse businesses, but there""s more we can do to spark change across the retail industry, support the Black community and ensure Black guests feel welcomed and represented when they shop at Target,"" chief growth officer Christina Hennington said in a news release. The killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and protests across the country have ratcheted up pressure on corporate leaders to advance racial equity and do more than simply cut a check — or risk losing business. The uneven death toll of the coronavirus pandemic and financial toll of the recession also spotlighted the country""s sharp racial disparities with health care and economic opportunity. Floyd was killed in Target""s hometown of Minneapolis, now the site of the murder trial for the police officer who kneeled on Floyd""s neck. One Target store, located near the site of Floyd""s death, had to be completely rebuilt and some of its other stores were damaged during rioting. Companies have spoken out about diversity and inclusion as consumers pay attention and some direct their dollars toward businesses that align with their values. Generation Z — the group of teens and early 20-somethings who are aging into shopping and establishing relationships with brands — care more about social justice compared with former generations, according to an annual survey of teens by Piper Sandler released Wednesday. Teens surveyed by the firm ranked racial equity as their most important political and social issue, followed by the environment and Black Lives Matter. Over the past year, major retailers like Nike, Walmart and Ulta Beauty have rolled out their own pledges, such as devoting more shelf space to Black-owned products, evaluating how they hire and promote employees, featuring more Black people in their ads and reducing the number of police or security in stores to prevent racial profiling. A growing number of retailers, including Macy""s, Sephora and Gap, have signed on to the 15 Percent Pledge, which aims to make Black-owned products on store shelves proportional to the country""s Black population. Among Target""s changes, the retailer said it will more actively seek out advertising firms, suppliers, construction companies and other kinds of businesses that are Black-owned. It said it will create a program called Forward Founders for early-stage start-ups led by Black entrepreneurs to help them develop, test and scale products to sell at mass retailers like Target. It will be modeled off of Target Accelerators, a program for start-ups that the retailer uses to foster up-and-coming brands and ultimately, to sell fresh and exclusive products that attract customers and help it differentiate from competitors. In some categories, such as beauty, Target said it already has 50 Black-owned and Black-founded brands — but would like to add more for other kinds of merchandise. Target previously committed to increasing Black representation in its workforce by 20% over the next three years. The company and its foundation are also giving $10 million to nonprofit organizations focused on addressing barriers for Black communities."
cnbc|"LONDON — There are no Black executives in the role of chair, chief executive or chief financial officer at Britain""s 100 biggest companies for the first time since 2014, according to a report on boardroom diversity.

This was according to annual research released Wednesday by U.K. executive recruitment and diversity consultancy agency Green Park. The initial findings from the Green Park Business Leaders 2021 index, which looked at the background of 6,172 workers in the U.K., showed that just 10 of the 297 people, or just over 3%, in the top three roles of FTSE 100 companies have ethnic minority backgrounds. This was the same proportion as when Green Park started its analysis of FTSE 100 companies in 2014. Green Park said that while the number of workers from most other ethnic minority groups in those top positions had slightly increased in the last six years, the number of Black leaders had stalled and then fallen to zero. The number of Black executive and non-executive directors on the boards of FTSE 100 companies had also fallen to 1.1% from 1.3% in the last six years, Green Park said. The prospect of greater Black representation at the top of the some of the U.K.""s biggest companies in the future was also found to be diminishing. The percentage of Black employees in the leadership pipeline had fallen to 0.9% from 1.4% in the last year, while wider ethnic minority representation had declined to 9% from 10.7%. Trevor Phillips, chair of Green Park, said that the findings ""put some flesh on the bone"" of last year""s Black Lives Matter protests. The international movement for racial justice led to a resurgence of protests in May and June last year, prompted in part by the killing of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor by police in the U.S. Phillips said there was no shortage of qualified candidates to fill these top roles in the FTSE 100. ""Yet the snowy peaks of British business remain stubbornly white,"" he said. The data coincided with the U.K.""s first ever ""Race Equality Week,"" which was co-founded by Green Park following last year""s Black Lives Matter protests, with the slogan: ""Let""s not go back to normal."" ""Corporate leaders need to stop telling us how much they care and do something to show us that black lives really do matter,"" Phillips said."
cnbc|"Michael Jordan is taking the next step to his $100 million commitment to the Black community. Through his Jordan Brand company, the basketball icon will offer social organizations funds from a $1 million community grant program to help meet objectives in combating issues that plague Black communities. Firms with budgets of $3 million or less will be considered for the grants. Applicants can apply until April 30, are required to be U.S.-based and 501(c)(3) confirmed. Non-profit group Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors is coordinating the program, which will distribute money from Jordan brand""s $100 million pledge to fight racism and income inequality. ""Since announcing our commitment to the Black Community in June of 2020, we""ve been focused on two things – action and impact,"" Jordan brand president Craig Williams said in a statement. ""I""m excited about the impact these grants will have in the Black Community. We know that when we create positive change for the Black Community, there is a benefit for almost every other group."" Jordan""s brand joined top companies who donated funds to the Black community following a series of high-profile police killings in 2020, including George Floyd""s death. Former police officer Derek Chauvin is currently standing trial for killing Floyd and faces charges of second and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The Jordan brand made donations of up to $1 million last July, distributing money from the pledge to the NAACP, the Formerly Incarcerated and Convicted People and Families Movement (FICPFM), and Black Voters Matter organization. Phoenix Suns vice-chairman Jahm Najafi also donated $10 million to the National Basketball Association""s foundation on Wednesday. The money is in addition to the $10 million the Suns pledged. Najafi is the CEO of Arizona-based venture capital firm Najafi Companies. The league and its players union donated $300 million to enhance social and economic opportunities in the Black community through the NBA Foundation last year. Najafi made the headlines in February when he joined former NFL star Colin Kaepernick to form a special-purpose acquisition company (Mission Advancement Corp). The company aims to address race and diversity matters by acquiring direct-to-consumer sports and financial technology companies. Mission Advancement raised $345 million after an IPO on March 5 and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol ""MACC."" ""This past year I have been inspired by the NBA family""s efforts to advance social justice, especially through the Board of Governor""s long-term commitment in creating the NBA Foundation,"" said Najafi in a statement. ""I""ve seen firsthand how economic opportunity can change lives, and I look forward to supporting the Foundation over the next 10 years as they impact the lives of Black youth."""
cnbc|"Carla Harris, Morgan Stanley""s vice chair of Global Wealth Management, said Wednesday that the acceleration of the Black Lives Matter movement has come in tandem with an uptick in investing interest in diverse and female-led companies. Harris, who spoke via video call at the annual Delivering Alpha conference presented by CNBC and Institutional Investor, added that investors in the modern era no longer have an excuse for being unable to find investments that prioritize a diverse c-suite and workforce. ""Especially since the Black Lives Matter movement has accelerated, more of the venture capitalists that that we talked to last year are now saying that they are actively looking for investment opportunities with multicultural and female entrepreneurs,"" Harris said. The Morgan Stanley executive added that it""s also important for an investor considering a stake in a diverse company to themselves have multicultural colleagues. ""I""ll tell you some of the suggestions that we made in our last white paper that they actually have embraced,"" she continued. ""They""re things like making sure that you give feedback when you have an entrepreneur who comes to you and you decide not to invest: Give them the feedback on what they can do to enhance and maybe come back and get another bite at the apple."" ""Expanding your network, showing up at the conferences and the convenings where these entrepreneurs are trafficking,"" Harris said. ""More importantly, make sure that you have a multicultural partner at the table because that obviously gives you an opportunity to access to a network that you may not have."" Harris, one of Wall Street""s most powerful women, was joined on the panel by Kewsong Lee, the chief executive of The Carlyle Group. As one of the globe""s largest and most-recognized private equity firms, Carlyle has for years stressed diversity among the companies it works with, Lee said. ""Companies that are more diverse in our portfolio grow 12% faster than companies that are less diverse,"" Lee told CNBC""s Sharon Epperson. ""That""s just proof that it shows up in better performance if we can drive better performance."" ""It absolutely helps drive performance,"" he added. The comments from Harris and Lee come amid what many consider a fundamental change in the way investors analyze and invest in companies toward one that factors a firm""s impact on the environment, society at large and how it conducts its own governance. Shortened to the acronym ESG, Morgan Stanley wrote last month that the new focus is ""likely to dominate financial markets during the 2020s"" due to societal trends driving change across consumer, corporate and investor behavior. Companies with more diversity, for example, tend to score better all else equal when an investor is evaluating a prospective stake. But firms like Morgan Stanley and Carlyle stress that their focus on ESG isn""t purely altruistic, but rather critical to to understanding a company""s growth potential as well as possible risks, among other things. ""The Covid-19 crisis has brought social and governance elements to the fore, and these have gained a lot of traction with investors,"" the firm said in a note to clients. ""In particular, there has been an added focus on how companies treat their employees, suppliers, customers and society as a whole, as investors incorporate the treatment of stakeholders into their investment process."""
cnbc|"Apple, Amazon and Google recently updated their smart voice assistants. They now explain the Black Lives Matter movement when asked ""Do black lives matter?"" and also provide updated responses to ""Do all lives matter?"" It shows how tech companies need to quickly update their technology to align with world events. Voice assistants need to be able to understand nuance and properly respond to a question now and in the future. Separately, during the spread of coronavirus, for example, Google, Amazon and Apple updated their voice assistants to provide additional information on Covid-19.

cnbc|"In tweets, corporate statements and letters to their employees, some of the nation""s top business leaders are expressing relief at the guilty verdict in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in the murder of George Floyd. They are also calling for the country to continue to fight against systemic racism and for police reform. Chauvin was found guilty of all three charges, including second-degree murder and third-degree murder, on Tuesday. Last spring, Floyd""s murder catalyzed Black Lives Matter protests across the country and the globe. A video taken by a teenage bystander, Darnella Frazier, outside of a Minneapolis convenience store, showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd""s neck for about nine minutes. In Floyd""s final moments, he struggled to breathe and called out for his mother. As protestors marched in the streets, companies faced scrutiny for their own records on racial equity. They were pushed to do more than simply put out statements — prompting a series of corporate commitments from overhauling how companies recruit and hire Black employees to backing mandatory deescalation training for police. Here is a round-up of reactions to the Chauvin verdict by business leaders and companies, in alphabetical order: ""There are countless examples of violence against Black men and women that don""t end this way. In the past year, a number of brutal and senseless murders of Black Americans – from Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor to Daunte Wright and many others – remind us of the stark reality and persistence of systemic racism in our country. They sparked anger, awareness and dialogue; but not the change needed to address injustice in our communities and institutions. As an airline, we bring people of all races, ethnicities and backgrounds together every day."" ""We believe Black lives matter. We know there is more work to do to achieve racial justice and equity in our society, and we remain committed to the journey."" — Excerpts from a letter sent to employees Tuesday night by American Airlines executives, CEO Doug Parker, President Robert Isom and Cedric Rockamore, vice president of global people operations and diversity and inclusion — Tim Cook, Apple CEO, said on his personal Twitter account ""While this verdict in the murder of George Floyd symbolizes some measure of progress toward racial equity and accountability, it does not fully erase our nation""s history of systemic and institutional racism. We still have a long way to go in our fight for racial justice in this country, and Best Buy""s unwavering commitment to this work is as strong as ever."" — Statement from Best Buy ""Today""s verdict confirms that George Floyd was the victim of a senseless crime. Though today""s verdict is a step toward justice in this case, unarmed Black men and women continue to die in encounters with the police. To ensure true justice and healing, our country needs to take steps to address its long history of racial inequity in law enforcement. Business Roundtable will continue to work with Members of Congress and the Administration on bipartisan policing reforms that implement national policing standards, and greater accountability, training, community engagement and transparency."" — Statement by group of CEOs, which is led by its chairman, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon — Chuck Robbins, Cisco CEO, said on his personal Twitter account ""George Floyd""s murder almost one year ago sparked a much needed reckoning on racism in America. It rightly pushed us as individuals and as a company to examine what we can and should do — what we must do — to take action to create a more equitable society. The verdict in the trial today sparks a great deal of emotion for many of us. It feels like justice has been finally served, yet it doesn""t end the grief felt by so many. It underscores the EMT""s executive management team""s commitment — shared by so many of you — to be allies, to fight systemic racism at every level, and to support all those facing injustice.

However, the systemic racism and social injustice apparent in the killing of George Floyd and countless other terrible episodes in our country are deeply rooted. Together, we must remain thoughtful and determined in addressing this reality, including the unacceptable abuse of authority and power and the pain it causes – disproportionately for the Black community and other people of color.

The solidarity and stand against racism since then have been unlike anything I""ve experienced. Like outraged people everywhere, I had an overwhelming hope that today""s verdict would provide real accountability. Anything short of that would have shaken my faith that our country had truly turned a corner. Today""s guilty verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial is another sign of forward progress. As I think about the Minneapolis Police Department denouncing the brutality George Floyd faced, and the disgrace expressed by multiple witnesses, the jury""s verdict reassures me that we will not go backward.

fox_news|"Fox News 'Outnumbered' panel weighs in on Sen. Tim Scott getting praise for rebuttal to Biden's speech. Some prominent liberal groups, including Black Lives Matter and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), haven't weighed in on the ""Uncle Tim"" Twitter insults lobbed at Sen. Tim Scott Wednesday night. Scott, R-S.C., the only Black Republican in the Senate, delivered Republicans' response to President Biden's address to a joint session of Congress. The senator, who is behind a push for police reform legislation and had a bill on the issue blocked via filibuster by Senate Democrats last year, made headlines by declaring ""America is not a racist country."" ""I've also experienced a different kind of intolerance,"" Scott also said. ""I get called Uncle Tom and the N-word by progressives, by liberals. Just last week, a national newspaper suggested my family's poverty was actually a privilege."" TIM SCOTT RESPONDS TO 'STUNNING' ASSAULT FROM LEFT: 'THEY'RE LITERALLY ATTACKING THE COLOR OF MY SKIN' Those comments and other elements of his speech led many liberals to write Twitter posts changing the racial insult ""Uncle Tom"" to ""Uncle Tim"" in reference to the senator. Some Black people used the term, including left-wing activists Bree Newsome and Tariq Nasheed, as well as commentator Touré. But some White progressives also used the term, including television personality Scott Nevins, who later apologized. The term was trending for hours before Twitter eventually blocked it Thursday morning, saying the move was ""in line with our policies on Trends... to promote healthy conversations on Twitter."" Republicans widely condemned the use of the term to refer to Scott. And Scott himself addressed the comments on ""Fox & Friends"" Thursday morning. ""Intolerance so often comes from the left with words like 'Uncle Tim' and the 'n-word' being used against me,"" Scott said. ""And last night what was trending in social media was 'Uncle Tim,' and they doubled down on this concept of liberal oppression. It is stunning in 2021 that those who speak about ending discrimination want to end it by more discrimination."" LIBERALS ERUPTED ON TIM SCOTT FOR SAYING AMERICA ISN'T RACIST, BUT KAMALA HARRIS AGREES ""The left has... doubled down that they are going to, not attack my policies, but they're literally attacking the color of my skin,"" he added. ""You can't step out of your lane according to the liberal elite left."" But the NAACP and Black Lives Matter, two groups whose mission is to fight discrimination, have not made any statements on the attacks against Scott. Neither group responded to requests for comment from Fox News on Thursday. The only apparent public reaction to Scott's speech from either group was a Wednesday night tweet from the NAACP that was critical of Scott's comment that ""America is not a racist country."" ""America is not a racist country!?!"" the group posted. ""@TimScottSC we should have a Word or a Word of Prayer!"" Scott, who is seen by some as a potential 2024 presidential contender, was widely praised by Republicans for his Wednesday response. Those on the right are likely to continue to discuss Scott's speech and the Democrats' reaction to it as Congress moves ahead with discussions on police reform. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP New Hampshire Republican Party Chairman Steve Stepanek on Thursday said comments directed against Scott by ""the left"" are ""outrageous.""

In a previous conversation, Garcia told Velshi she wanted to see Biden tackle: an uprooting of racism in every aspect of daily life, the reallocation of resources and the strengthing of oversight measures for law enforcement agencies. BLACK LIVES MATTER CALLS FOR 'MONTHLY' STIMULUS CHECKS FOR FAMILIES CRUSHED BY PANDEMIC ""Let's talk about that first one, uprooting racism in policing,"" Velshi said. ""You made a really good point the other day. This is racism. It's not the same as bad cops."" ""So here's the thing about uprooting systemic racism, one it's everywhere. It's almost like the air we breathe,"" Garza replied. ""So that is why we have to actually know what we're looking for in order to not just diagnose the problem but to address it."" She added that racism is about rules that have been manipulated to give power to one group over another. ""That is why we have such deep racial inequities when you look at health care, when you look at education... policing and law enforcement,"" she said. ""It is because there are rules and policies that are being enforced that actually hold up these disparities."" Garza said she focused on the issue because of the nationwide racial reckoning and protests seen last year after the death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody. ""We have not gone far enough,"" Garza said. ""Consciousness is good but changing rules and making new and better ones is even better.""

""I'm just simply making the argument that the words are not complicated,"" she said. ""Police in this country actually have more rights than civilians do. Also, police budgets and military budgets in this country are incredibly bloated and at the same time we have .. schools that are underresourced."""

""But that's deception by understatement. Black Lives Matter is not a collection of marchers with signs. It's not a conventional political lobby like Planned Parenthood or the NRA ...

""Republican leaders brag about their strong conservative convictions, but mostly they just want to be on the winning team, whatever that is,"" Carlson said. ""That is why they pause before offending China. It's why when Black Lives Matter tells them to take a knee, they do. ""It's all pretty strange when you think about it.

""Imagine a world,"" the host said later, ""where you are punished for questioning the behavior of the president or for insulting your local mayor. You probably can't imagine that because it's too bizarre. It is un-American but that is where we are right now.

Black Lives Matter accused President-elect Joe Biden of ignoring their request for a meeting and disregarding the Black voters that helped secure his White House victory. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris haven't responded to their request for a post-election conversation and even excluded BLM from a recent meeting with civil rights groups, according to the group. ""For the newly elected administration (that ran on promises of racial justice) to ignore our ongoing request to meet with them and refuse us a seat at the table is demeaning to our movement,"" Black Lives Matter Global Network said in an email to supporters on Thursday in urging activists to make noise.

It's demeaning to the countless times we took our protest to the streets to call for justice for our Black brothers and sisters taken from us at the hands of police."" The Biden transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Patrisse Cullors, Black Lives Matter co-founder, sent Biden and Harris a request for a meeting on Nov. 7 to talk of the agenda to address systemic racism and got support from 64,000 backers who signed a petition. Cullors said Black voters put Biden in office and ""we want something for our vote."" Black Lives Matter says they haven't gotten a response in the month since. What's more, they were shut out of a Tuesday meeting with Biden, Harris and Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., an incoming senior adviser, to discuss recommendations for the Attorney General nominee and police and criminal justice reforms. ""To set up a meeting with civil rights leaders, without BLM, is unacceptable,"" BLM tweeted.

fox_news|"In a new episode of Fox Nation's ""No Interruption,"" Tomi Lahren sat down with the president of Black Lives Matter of Greater New York, Hawk Newsome, who argued that his organization and others like it are justified in using destruction to call attention to their grievances with American society. ""The riot is the language of the unheard,"" said Newsome, who compared modern-day protests to The Boston Tea Party. Original Series, Documentaries, Movies & more that Celebrate America The quote ""language of the unheard"" is from Martin Luther King Jr""s ""The Other America"" speech, delivered in 1967 and 1968. In the speeches, King did not defend rioting but said it was the result of understandable anger. ""What if you throw a whole bunch of tea in the water and start a war?"" Newsome continued at another point in the interview. ""That's what this country was built on."" Lahren specifically challenged Newsome over recent anti-police protests in the New York area and, most notably, a Jan. 31 demonstration involving reportedly thousands of protesters who flooded transportation stations and hubs around New York City. The protests were reportedly organized by a collection of 30 grassroots groups called ""Decolonize This Place."" Protesters carried signs with slogans like ""F--- the Police"" and ""No cops! No fares!""  NYPD Chief Terence Monahan said in a tweet that some individuals even attempted to ""physically assault"" police officers. ""There are a lot of black people who say 'f--- the police,'"" said Newsome. ""But the majority of the people out there who are saying 'f--- the police', in these particular events, are white people."" ""You have to really start to ask why people say, 'f--- the police,'"" he continued. ""You really have to take away this fetish or the way that we fantasize policing and really look at it for what it really is."" ""From day one, black people's interactions with the police had been negative,"" argued Newsome, who says that the ""institution of policing"" is racist. ""They started out with slave patrols,"" he said, pointing to the federal Fugitive Slave Acts of 1793 and 1850, which allowed for the capture and return of enslaved people. ""The Fugitive Slave Act, where they would take black people, stop them in the street, ask them for their papers, if they couldn't produce them they'd send them back into slavery,"" he said. ""Sometimes they sent free people back into slavery. The interaction between black people and police in this country has never been good."" While Lahren said she disagreed with Newsome's assessment of the police, she said she wanted to focus on the tactics of the movement. ""I'm not going to disagree with what you believe in... What I'm saying is this -- when we're talking about solving problems, the methods in which I've seen groups like Black Lives Matter advance their ills or societal grievances -- when it turns into burning, looting in the streets, I don't see it being productive,"" said Lahren. Newsome claimed that destructive protests are rare, but he did not condemn them. ""The white supremacists who built this country never earned anything peacefully. They did it through bullets and blood.  And that's the American way."" ""For a country that drops bombs on people, for a country that incarcerates people, for a country that enslaves people -- to criticize us for vandalism is preposterous,"" said Newsome. ""I want to make sure I'm getting you clearly,"" pressed Lahren. ""It is OK to vandalize, to light things on fire and to loot businesses because the United States of America drops bombs on other countries, and because we have problems... people have grievances."" ""It is OK to act in that manner? And you co-sign on to that as the chairman of Black Lives Matter. You were saying that that is OK?"" VIRAL VIDEO SHOWS INDIVIDUAL THREATENING PRO-TRUMP STUDENT GROUP ""I think that it is a tool of white supremacy to say if you want freedom, then you get it by protesting peacefully,"" said Newsome. ""Why is it a tool of white supremacy?"" he concluded. ""Because the white supremacists who built this country never earned anything peacefully. They did it through bullets and blood.

Trump, who has remained at the top of the GOP primary polls for weeks, came on Bill O'Reilly's prime-time show to promote his protest Wednesday alongside his 2016 rival Sen. Ted Cruz against President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran. As per usual, he did not have any kind words for the president's proposal. ""It""s one of the most incompetently drawn contracts I""ve ever seen,"" Trump told O'Reilly. ""We don""t get anything, we""re getting nothing from this deal."" The real estate mogul went on to say that if he is elected president he would ""make it much, much better,"" adding ""how Obama got away with it is beyond anybody's comprehension."" The GOP candidate's remarks on a host of other issues were a little bit more eyebrow-raising. RELATED: Trump boasts of 'military life' — despite never serving Although Trump is far from the first Republican presidential candidate to condemn the Black Lives Matter movement, he went further than most, alleging that ""they're trouble, I think they're looking for trouble."" He said he thinks ""it's disgraceful the way that they're being catered to by Democrats,"" and repeatedly stated that ""all lives matter."" When O'Reilly pointed out that Colin Powell, a registered Republican, has expressed support for the movement, Trump scoffed, ""He's wrong, he's totally wrong,"" adding ""He's obviously catering to someone."" Trump distanced himself from reports that he would be open to continuing government funding of Planned Parenthood. A testy Trump told O'Reilly he must have ""bad researchers"" because he ""never"" said he would provide funds for Planned Parenthood. ""A lot of people say it""s an abortion clinic, I""m opposed to that,"" Trump said Tuesday. However, during a CNN interview earlier this month, Trump did say he would be open to funding ""parts"" of the controversial women's health organization. ""I would look at the good aspects of it,"" Trump said. ""I""m sure they do some things properly and good for women and I would look at that, and I""d look at other aspects also, but we have to take care of women. We have to absolutely take care of women. The abortion aspect of Planned Parenthood absolutely should not be funded,"" he said at the time. Conservative supporters of Trump might have been surprised to hear that he believes Kentucky clerk Kim Davis was wrong to refuse to grant marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples. Although Trump said, ""I am very strong believer in Christianity and religion,"" he acknowledged that the clerk position ""was not the right job for her,"" which puts him at odds with candidates like Mike Huckabee, who has fully endorsed Davis' decision to not follow the law. ""Whether you like the decision or not you have to go along with the Supreme Court,"" Trump said. Trump, who would later be greeted with boos at the U.S. Open tournament in New York City, also held court on the migrant crisis in Europe (he said he feared some of the refugees might be affiliated with ISIS) and Syria (he advocated military intervention, in ""retrospect""). He also lamented that ""Paris doesn't look like Paris anymore,"" but failed to extrapolate on how and yet again, laid the blame at the foot of President Obama.

msnbc|"When Elizabeth Neumann was a Trump-appointed official at the Department of Homeland Security, she served as assistant secretary for threat prevention and security policy. Her focus, as her title suggested, was focused on identifying possible domestic security threats. What Neumann discovered, however, was that it was effectively impossible to convince Donald Trump to take seriously the threat posed by violent right-wing extremists. The president, the then-leading official at DHS came to realize, simply wouldn't listen. (Neumann, who voted for Trump in 2016, publicly endorsed Joe Biden last week.) It appears, however, that Team Trump will take seriously the possibility of a perceived domestic security threat, just so long as it fits into the White House's ideological predispositions. TPM noted this morning: Fox News' Tucker Carlson pressed the acting Homeland Security chief on possible criminal charges against ""the leaders of antifa and BLM."" Wolf said he'd spoken directly to Attorney General Bill Barr about this, adding, ""I know that they are working on it."" The acting secretary added that the Justice Department is ""targeting and investigating the head of these organizations, the individuals that are paying for these individuals to move across the country."" Asked about punishing protest ""funders,"" Wolf went on to say, ""Again, I would say that again the Department of Justice, who has the lead in all of those investigations, are certainly moving as quickly as possible."" A few hours earlier, Donald Trump stood at the podium in the White House briefing room and declared, ""The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice are announcing a joint operation center to investigate the violent, left-wing civil unrest."" The president, naturally, made no reference to right-wing violence. It's difficult to say with confidence what to make of rhetoric like this. It's certainly possible that Trump has no idea what he's talking about, there is no ""joint operation center,"" and Chad Wolf made baseless on-air comments as a way of making Tucker Carlson happy during an interview the president was likely watching. It's also possible that leading Trump administration officials are gearing up to prosecute Americans the president perceives as menacing enemies. Barr has already demonstrated an eagerness to politicize federal law enforcement, so it's hardly outrageous to think this would be the next step. Watch this space."

Activists with the Black Lives Matter movement have roiled Democratic politics in recent months, interrupting speeches by the party's presidential candidates as they try to force the party to prioritize their issues.

""We all have a responsibility to face these hard truths about race and justice honestly and directly,"" the former secretary of state said. Standing alongside several mayors in the packed Brookland Baptist Church in West Columbia, South Carolina, Clinton championed the work being done at the local level and called for what she termed ""flexible federalism,"" a system in which the federal government and local communities work hand-in-hand. RELATED: Progressive movement confronts its own 'demons' on race ""We have worked hard to come back from the Great Recession,"" Clinton said. ""With President Obama""s leadership and the determination of the American people, we are standing. But we need to start running together."" Clinton earned big applause for her lines on income inequality and women in the workforce. But her most powerful remarks came early on, when she addressed the recent killings of African-Americans in South Carolina. In April, Walter Scott, an unarmed black man, was fatally shot by a white police officer during a daytime traffic stop. The officer, Michael T. Slager, has been charged with murder. Two months later, nine African-American parishioners were killed during a Bible study session at the historic Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. The accused shooter, 21-year-old Dylann Roof, has been charged with murder, hate crimes, firearms violations, and obstructing the practice of religion. ""I think it""s been a remarkable time for South Carolina and, as President Obama recently said, an example of true grace,"" Clinton said. ""That did not come from above; that came from people in communities rising up, speaking out, acting together."" The Charleston shooting sparked a national conversation over the Confederate flag, a symbol that appears frequently in photos of Roof. Clinton said Thursday that ""we were all grateful when the leaders of this state did the right thing and removed the Confederate battle flag from the statehouse grounds."" But, she added, ""the work of healing our communities and taking on the challenges of systemic racism is far from finished."" Clinton also addressed the recent death of Sandra Bland, an African-American woman who apparently committed suicide after being arrested during a traffic stop in Texas. ""I was heartbreaking to read about,"" Clinton said of Bland. ""It is essential that we all stand up and say loudly and clearly, ""Yes, black lives matter."""" The line, as well as the sentiments expressed in the speech more broadly, stood in stark contrast to recent fumbles on the same topic by Clinton""s primary opponents, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O""Malley. Last weekend, black activists interrupted a presidential candidate forum at the Netroots Nation conference in Phoenix, Arizona, forcing Sanders and O""Malley into uncomfortable territory as they struggled to respond to questions on race relations and police violence from representatives of the Black Lives Matter movement. O""Malley has since apologized for adding ""white lives matter, all lives matter"" to the protesters"" calls. On a larger scale, however, the exchange targeted the progressive movement as a whole for allowing racial justice issues to fade into the background.

And yet, listening to only Republican senators' questions would lead you to believe that last year's nationwide protests against police brutality were just as violent and riotous as the attempt to overturn the election. Wednesday was 30 years to the day since Los Angeles police beat Rodney King during a traffic stop, setting off protests that engulfed the city and riveted the country. It feels at times like we're no closer to ending police brutality than we were then. For these senators to draw lines of comparison between people seeking justice and a mob set on hurting their colleagues is a shameful deflection from these members, no matter how much they try to mask their intentions. Well, to be fair, it wasn't much of a mask. Did any of these GOP senators actually say the name ""Black Lives Matter"" during their questioning? No. But in most cases, what they meant in their repeated references to ""last spring"" and ""last summer"" was perfectly clear. ""In the past year, we have seen massive rioting and violence as extremists, many of them leftist extremists, took to the streets across the country,"" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said during FBI Director Christopher Wray's testimony Wednesday. He then asked Wray what the FBI is ""doing to counter this ongoing pattern of domestic terrorism."" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., upped the stakes Wednesday during a hearing with the head of the D.C. National Guard and officials from the departments of Defense, Justice and Homeland Security. Bouncing off one witness's answer, Hawley referred to ""the events of the spring, which we're all familiar with."" ""I mean, we had the attack on the White House, where 60 Secret Service officers were injured, the president had to be evacuated into a bunker, the church across the street was lit on fire,"" Hawley said. To echo The Washington Post's Philip Bump, calling what happened in late May 2020 an ""attack on the White House"" is a real bit of historical revisionism. That's especially the case when you consider what former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund told Congress on Feb. 23. When asked about the difference in preparations for Jan. 6 compared to last summer, Sund was unequivocal: To repeat: The Capitol Police were way more worried about the gathering of former President Donald Trump's supporters than about any Black Lives Matters protest that took place last year. And even with that extra preparation, it was the mob that Trump whipped into a frenzy that stormed the Capitol and sought to harm the people inside. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have tried to make it clear that despite the conspiracies floating around the conservative and far-right infospheres, the Jan. 6 attack wasn't a scheme to make Trump look bad. ""Is there any evidence at all that it was organized or planned or carried out by groups like antifa or Black Lives Matter?"" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., asked Wray. ""We have not seen any evidence to that effect thus far in the investigation,"" Wray responded. Now, knowing all that, let's give the senators the benefit of the doubt for a moment. Let's assume that they really are just asking these questions to form their own baselines for comparison. After all, these are two major events that involved massive deployments of law enforcement. That would be understandable, to a degree. What I don't get, though, is being unwilling to say — on Twitter, in an op-ed, somewhere — that you've been told that Jan. 6 was different from the Black Lives Matter protests, even if you don't agree with those protests' aims. That yes, these are the people who the FBI says took part in the riot, and there's no reason to doubt that assessment. And if you're honestly seeking more information about how law enforcement treats the far left, why is this forum — a set of hearings about a specific attack — the right place to raise those points if not to diminish the severity of the right-wing attack? Like I said last week, when it comes down to brass tacks, the two events aren't comparable — not in terms of the threat that they posed to the country and not in terms of the police response. The temptation to use the fight for Black equality as a punching bag must be a strong one, especially as a way to shield your compatriots from their role in inciting mob violence. It's truly outrageous, though, how disrespectful it is to draw this false equivalency between the two again and again, even as the Capitol girds itself for a possible repeat of the violence of Jan. 6 and the police brutality denounced in the streets in 2020 continues to this day. Meanwhile, the House passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act on Wednesday night. If it passes in the Senate and onto President Joe Biden's desk would be a big step towards making the Black Lives Matter protests obsolete. And isn't that what these Republicans want? For the protests to end?I look forward to reading about their newfound support."
msnbc|"Major groups associated with the Black Lives Matter movement will host Democratic presidential candidates for a town hall focusing on social and racial justice. The Democratic National Committee approved the extra forum for 2016 hopefuls on Wednesday, but remained steadfast against adding another candidate debate to the schedule, according to letters first obtained by the Washington Post. The letters, sent from the DNC to prominent activist groups the #BlackLivesMatter network and Campaign Zero, affirm the party's support of the growing social movement and heed their request to hold a forum that explicitly addresses issues of race and social justice. ""We believe that your organization would be an ideal host for a presidential candidate forum — where all of the Democratic candidates can showcase their ideas and policy positions that will expand opportunity for all, strengthen the middle class and address racism in America,"" Amy K. Dacey, chief executive officer of the DNC, wrote in the letters obtained by the Post. ""The DNC would be happy to help promote the event."" The Democratic Party has seen factions within its ranks in recent weeks over the number of debates scheduled for candidates -- top leaders and candidates have pressured for more head-to-heads. But the inclusion of a racial justice themed forum speaks to the outsized political clout activist organizations have earned in a social movement that is little more than a year old. Grassroots groups created in the aftermath of unarmed black teen Michael Brown's death at the hands of a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, last August have sparked a nationwide push for social justice and police reform. The groups' influence has extended into the political arena, with Black Lives Matter provisions now included in the Democratic Party's official plank and candidates rushing to court their favor after stumbling in the past. But prominent leaders within the Black Lives Matter umbrella have said that is not enough. After seeing just one question directly address race and police reform in the first Democratic presidential debate earlier this months, groups have been in talks with the DNC for a racial justice-specific forum. DeRay Mckesson, a prominent leader in the movement with a wide-reaching social media presence, told The Washington Post that he hopes to team up with the social network Twitter in hosting the candidate town hall."
msnbc|"Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump criticized the Iran deal, the Black Lives Matter movement and even embattled Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis during an appearance Tuesday on Fox News' ""The O'Reilly Factor."" Trump, who has remained at the top of the GOP primary polls for weeks, came on Bill O'Reilly's prime-time show to promote his protest Wednesday alongside his 2016 rival Sen. Ted Cruz against President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran. As per usual, he did not have any kind words for the president's proposal. ""It""s one of the most incompetently drawn contracts I""ve ever seen,"" Trump told O'Reilly. ""We don""t get anything, we""re getting nothing from this deal."" The real estate mogul went on to say that if he is elected president he would ""make it much, much better,"" adding ""how Obama got away with it is beyond anybody's comprehension."" The GOP candidate's remarks on a host of other issues were a little bit more eyebrow-raising. RELATED: Trump boasts of 'military life' — despite never serving Although Trump is far from the first Republican presidential candidate to condemn the Black Lives Matter movement, he went further than most, alleging that ""they're trouble, I think they're looking for trouble."" He said he thinks ""it's disgraceful the way that they're being catered to by Democrats,"" and repeatedly stated that ""all lives matter."" When O'Reilly pointed out that Colin Powell, a registered Republican, has expressed support for the movement, Trump scoffed, ""He's wrong, he's totally wrong,"" adding ""He's obviously catering to someone."" Trump distanced himself from reports that he would be open to continuing government funding of Planned Parenthood. A testy Trump told O'Reilly he must have ""bad researchers"" because he ""never"" said he would provide funds for Planned Parenthood. ""A lot of people say it""s an abortion clinic, I""m opposed to that,"" Trump said Tuesday. However, during a CNN interview earlier this month, Trump did say he would be open to funding ""parts"" of the controversial women's health organization. ""I would look at the good aspects of it,"" Trump said. ""I""m sure they do some things properly and good for women and I would look at that, and I""d look at other aspects also, but we have to take care of women. We have to absolutely take care of women. The abortion aspect of Planned Parenthood absolutely should not be funded,"" he said at the time. Conservative supporters of Trump might have been surprised to hear that he believes Kentucky clerk Kim Davis was wrong to refuse to grant marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples. Although Trump said, ""I am very strong believer in Christianity and religion,"" he acknowledged that the clerk position ""was not the right job for her,"" which puts him at odds with candidates like Mike Huckabee, who has fully endorsed Davis' decision to not follow the law. ""Whether you like the decision or not you have to go along with the Supreme Court,"" Trump said. Trump, who would later be greeted with boos at the U.S. Open tournament in New York City, also held court on the migrant crisis in Europe (he said he feared some of the refugees might be affiliated with ISIS) and Syria (he advocated military intervention, in ""retrospect""). He also lamented that ""Paris doesn't look like Paris anymore,"" but failed to extrapolate on how and yet again, laid the blame at the foot of President Obama. The ""Stop the Iran Deal"" rally, featuring Trump and hosted by the Tea Party Patriots among others, will kick off Wednesday at noon in Washington, D.C. Trump will share the stage with not just Cruz, but outspoken former Fox host Glenn Beck and former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin."
msnbc|"When Elizabeth Neumann was a Trump-appointed official at the Department of Homeland Security, she served as assistant secretary for threat prevention and security policy. Her focus, as her title suggested, was focused on identifying possible domestic security threats. What Neumann discovered, however, was that it was effectively impossible to convince Donald Trump to take seriously the threat posed by violent right-wing extremists. The president, the then-leading official at DHS came to realize, simply wouldn't listen. (Neumann, who voted for Trump in 2016, publicly endorsed Joe Biden last week.) It appears, however, that Team Trump will take seriously the possibility of a perceived domestic security threat, just so long as it fits into the White House's ideological predispositions. TPM noted this morning: Fox News' Tucker Carlson pressed the acting Homeland Security chief on possible criminal charges against ""the leaders of antifa and BLM."" Wolf said he'd spoken directly to Attorney General Bill Barr about this, adding, ""I know that they are working on it."" The acting secretary added that the Justice Department is ""targeting and investigating the head of these organizations, the individuals that are paying for these individuals to move across the country."" Asked about punishing protest ""funders,"" Wolf went on to say, ""Again, I would say that again the Department of Justice, who has the lead in all of those investigations, are certainly moving as quickly as possible."" A few hours earlier, Donald Trump stood at the podium in the White House briefing room and declared, ""The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice are announcing a joint operation center to investigate the violent, left-wing civil unrest."" The president, naturally, made no reference to right-wing violence. It's difficult to say with confidence what to make of rhetoric like this. It's certainly possible that Trump has no idea what he's talking about, there is no ""joint operation center,"" and Chad Wolf made baseless on-air comments as a way of making Tucker Carlson happy during an interview the president was likely watching. It's also possible that leading Trump administration officials are gearing up to prosecute Americans the president perceives as menacing enemies. Barr has already demonstrated an eagerness to politicize federal law enforcement, so it's hardly outrageous to think this would be the next step. Watch this space."
msnbc|"MINNEAPOLIS -- The Democratic National Committee passed a resolution Friday afternoon supporting the Black Lives Matter movement at the party's summer meeting. The national party also affirmed a resolution supporting same-sex marriage in every state and another honoring the son of Vice President Joe Biden, Beau Biden, who passed away in May. Activists with the Black Lives Matter movement have roiled Democratic politics in recent months, interrupting speeches by the party's presidential candidates as they try to force the party to prioritize their issues. ""The DNC joins with Americans across the country in affirming 'Black lives matter' and the 'say her name' efforts to make visible the pain of our fellow and sister Americans as they condemn extrajudicial killings of unarmed African American men, women and children,"" the resolution states. It also calls for Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform, and calls for minimizing the use of ""weapons that were used to police peaceful civilians in the streets of Ferguson, Missouri"" last summer. RELATED: Walker on Black Lives Matter: 'Who knows who that is?' The resolution passed the party's resolutions committee Thursday afternoon, and then was affirmed by the larger meeting of hundreds of DNC delegates Friday. Racial justice was also the key theme of the invocation given Friday morning by Rabbi Michael Adam Latz, who said ""we've replaced Jim Crow with mass incarceration."" The resolution honoring Biden, who was attorney general of Delaware and slated to run for governor, comes as his father takes a closer look at a White House bid that would pit him against Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, who addressed the party meeting Friday."
msnbc|"Attempting to soar where her rivals have recently floundered on issues of racial justice, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton addressed a crowd of nearly 400 in South Carolina Thursday and said unequivocally: ""Yes, black lives matter."" ""We all have a responsibility to face these hard truths about race and justice honestly and directly,"" the former secretary of state said. Standing alongside several mayors in the packed Brookland Baptist Church in West Columbia, South Carolina, Clinton championed the work being done at the local level and called for what she termed ""flexible federalism,"" a system in which the federal government and local communities work hand-in-hand. RELATED: Progressive movement confronts its own 'demons' on race ""We have worked hard to come back from the Great Recession,"" Clinton said. ""With President Obama""s leadership and the determination of the American people, we are standing. But we need to start running together."" Clinton earned big applause for her lines on income inequality and women in the workforce. But her most powerful remarks came early on, when she addressed the recent killings of African-Americans in South Carolina. In April, Walter Scott, an unarmed black man, was fatally shot by a white police officer during a daytime traffic stop. The officer, Michael T. Slager, has been charged with murder. Two months later, nine African-American parishioners were killed during a Bible study session at the historic Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. The accused shooter, 21-year-old Dylann Roof, has been charged with murder, hate crimes, firearms violations, and obstructing the practice of religion. ""I think it""s been a remarkable time for South Carolina and, as President Obama recently said, an example of true grace,"" Clinton said. ""That did not come from above; that came from people in communities rising up, speaking out, acting together."" The Charleston shooting sparked a national conversation over the Confederate flag, a symbol that appears frequently in photos of Roof. Clinton said Thursday that ""we were all grateful when the leaders of this state did the right thing and removed the Confederate battle flag from the statehouse grounds."" But, she added, ""the work of healing our communities and taking on the challenges of systemic racism is far from finished."" Clinton also addressed the recent death of Sandra Bland, an African-American woman who apparently committed suicide after being arrested during a traffic stop in Texas. ""I was heartbreaking to read about,"" Clinton said of Bland. ""It is essential that we all stand up and say loudly and clearly, ""Yes, black lives matter."""" The line, as well as the sentiments expressed in the speech more broadly, stood in stark contrast to recent fumbles on the same topic by Clinton""s primary opponents, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O""Malley. Last weekend, black activists interrupted a presidential candidate forum at the Netroots Nation conference in Phoenix, Arizona, forcing Sanders and O""Malley into uncomfortable territory as they struggled to respond to questions on race relations and police violence from representatives of the Black Lives Matter movement. O""Malley has since apologized for adding ""white lives matter, all lives matter"" to the protesters"" calls. On a larger scale, however, the exchange targeted the progressive movement as a whole for allowing racial justice issues to fade into the background. Clinton, who skipped this year""s Netroots, was spared from the ambush. But she""s far from perfect on the issue of racial justice in activists"" minds."

abc|"— -- The mother of a 25-year-old black man who was killed in a police-involved shooting in Chicago this weekend said that ""words cannot describe"" the pain she feels right now. Joshua Beal was killed on Saturday afternoon while he was in town from Indianapolis to attend the funeral of his cousin, according to his mother, Tiffaney Boxley. ""Joshua was a laid back guy, he enjoyed spending time with his family, especially his children; his children was his world,"" Boxley told ABC News, adding that he was a father to two young sons, ages 4 and 2. The shooting occurred after a vehicle leaving the funeral service at a nearby cemetery stopped in traffic in front of a Chicago firehouse, police said, according to local ABC-owned station WLS. The station reported that police said an off-duty firefighter told the driver that they were illegally blocking the fire lane. The occupants then exited the vehicle and an altercation ensued, according to authorities, WLS reported. An off-duty Chicago police officer inside a nearby business noticed the altercation and came out to assist the firefighter, police said. Then, a Chicago police sergeant driving to work stopped when he observed a man with a firearm in his hands, police said, according to WLS. After the man ""failed to drop his weapon, shots were fired striking the individual multiple times,"" according to authorities, WLS reported. After the incident, Beal was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center, where he was later pronounced dead, according to WLS. Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that both the sergeant and the off-duty officer fired their weapons, according to The Chicago Tribune. It's not clear which of their shots hit Beal, Guglielmi said, The Tribune reported. Beal's handgun was recovered at the scene, according to Guglielmi. When asked for comment by ABC News, the Chicago Police Department referred all inquiries to the Independent Police Review Authority, which is investigating the incident. Boxley described her son as a devoted father. ""My son Joshua was a family man, he took care of two little children, he was engaged to his fiancée,"" she said. ""How do I tell my 4-year-old grandson that his daddy is not coming back?"" Boxley added. Boxley said she wasn't there when her son was shot, ""but my daughter, and his fiancée, and several other family members were eyewitnesses to him being gunned down like an animal in the street."" Beal's family said that he did not provoke the officer and was trying to tell the officer that he had a concealed weapon permit when he was shot, according to WLS. Beal's death sparked protests in Chicago on Sunday after multiple recordings of the shooting surfaced online. WLS reported that there were tense clashes between Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter groups. Mia Sissac, a spokesperson for the Independent Police Review Authority, told ABC News that the Beal shooting was a ""complicated case,"" and said that the agency expected to publicize findings in the incident ""within the next 60 days."" Sissac said that the early efforts of the agency are centering around examining the video evidence that has appeared online. ""One of our first priorities is to try and authenticate any recordings that have circulated,"" Sissac said. Michael Edison Hayden contributed to this report."
abc|"— -- Prosecutors dropped all charges against the three remaining Baltimore police officers charged in the death of Freddie Gray despite holding firm in their belief that Gray's death was a homicide. ""We do not believe that Gray killed himself. We stand by the medical examiner's determination that Freddie Gray""s death was a homicide,"" Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn J. Mosby told reporters Wednesday, delivering a strong defense for her decision to prosecute six officers involved in Gray's death. ""Those that believe that I""m anti-police, that is simply not the case, I am anti-police brutality,"" Mosby said, adding that she was elected as chief prosecutor for Baltimore City and took an oath to seek justice. ""I take my oath very seriously,"" she said. Earlier Wednesday morning, prosecutors announced they would not pursue the remaining cases related to the arrest and death of Gray at the pre-trial motions hearing for Officer Garrett Miller, the fifth officer to stand trial. Their decision to drop the charges brought to an end one of the most closely watched police prosecutions in the country. The gag order against all parties involved, including prosecutors and defense attorneys and their clients, was also rescinded. ""After much thought and prayer it has become clear that without being able to work with an independent investigatory agency from the very start, without having a say in the election of whether cases proceed in front of a judge or jury, without communal oversight of police in this community, without substantive reforms to the current criminal justice system, we could try this case 100 times and cases just like it and we would still end up with the same result,"" Mosby said, standing across the street from the location where Gray was arrested in April 2015. Mosby charged six officers last year for their role in the arrest and death of Gray, a 25-year-old black man who died while in police custody after he suffered a fatal spinal injury while being transported in the back of a police van. Prosecutors aimed to show that the officers who arrested him were criminally liable for failing to secure Gray with a seat belt after he was loaded into the transport vehicle. Gray died seven days after sustaining his injuries. On the day of Gray's funeral, the city of Baltimore erupted into chaos, with violent protests and rioting taking hold of the city. But prosecutors failed to convict four officers who were tried in separate trials earlier this year. Three officers were acquitted by Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Barry Williams, who decided the outcome of the trials because the defendants each chose to be tried by him rather than a jury. Officer Edward Nero was found not guilty of all charges in May. Officer Caesar Goodson, the driver of the police transport van, faced the most serious charge of second-degree depraved heart murder for giving Gray an alleged ""rough ride"" was found not guilty earlier this summer. And Lieutenant Brian Rice, the highest-ranking officer involved with the case, was cleared of all charges just two weeks ago. The only officer to elect a jury trial was Officer William Porter, who""s trial ended with a hung jury last December. He was due to be retried in September of this year. Sgt. Alicia White""s trial was slated for October, the sixth and final officer to stand trial. All of the officers involved in the case pleaded not guilty. Throughout the trials, prosecutors tried honing in on each officer's experience and training, suggesting that they should have known the consequences and risks of failing to secure a shackled prisoner with a seat belt. But Williams disagreed and delivered not guilty verdicts for Nero, Goodson, and Rice, and said prosecutors failed to prove in court that the defendants acted in a grossly negligent manner, and that they could not prove the officers acted unreasonably because there was no way to determine if they knew the risks involved. He also said that prosecutors were unable to provide evidence to prove that the officers acted in a corrupt manner. Williams was oftentimes incredulous throughout the trials, repeatedly admonishing prosecutors for their failure in bringing forth any credible evidence that could prove criminal wrongdoing. During Nero's case in May, Williams grilled prosecutors during closing arguments -- questioning whether a crime was even committed. ""So, every time there""s an arrest without probable justification – it is a crime?"" Williams asked. ""I""m trying to make sure it was a criminal assault. Touching Freddie Gray is assault?"" ""We believe that the search and arrest without justification are assault, your honor,"" Deputy State""s Attorney Janice Bledsoe responded. ""There""s no question about that."" Mosby on Wednesday said despite the acquittals from Williams, ""We must respect the verdict rendered by the judge,"" and that her goal all along was to ""always seek justice over convictions."""
abc|"— -- Thousands of people took to the streets of cities across the U.S. Friday night -- many against the backdrop of watchful riot gear-wearing police -- following the police shootings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota, and the deadly sniper attack on police officers in Dallas. Howard University student George Wyche, who took part in a rally outside the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., conveyed a sentiment common among those taking to the streets to seek an end to police violence: ""It's a time for belief in the greater good of humanity,"" he told The Associated Press. While most of the gatherings nationwide were peaceful, at least 90 people were arrested or detained by law enforcement officials across the country, with pepperballs and stun guns unleashed by riot gear-wearing police in some cities. The most chaotic demonstrations were those in Phoenix; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Rochester, New York. The scene in Phoenix was dramatic, with riot gear-wearing police unleashing non-lethal pepperballs against protesters at a rally that began outside city hall, organized by civil rights leader Rev. Jarrett Maupin. Despite the seemingly chaotic imagery, only three individuals who threw rocks at officers were arrested. About 1,000 people chanted ""black lives matter"" and ""hands up, don't shoot"" as they marched in downtown Phoenix. Minor scuffles broke out when a man wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" T-shirt and holding a Donald Trump campaign sign pushed his way into the protest. Police pulled the man aside to let the marchers continue. Sergeant Vince Lewis of the Phoenix Police Department said in a statement, ""Phoenix Police responded to the downtown area for the 'Rally for Justice' demonstration. A specific route was provided to police; however that route was changed and at one point the group expressed intent to march onto the I-10 freeway...A skirmish line was established and non-lethal pepperballs were deployed to move advancing demonstrators back. Three arrests were made of subjects who had thrown rocks at police. Officers were struck on their helmet(s) and protective gear, but no injuries to officers were reported. As many as six injuries to citizens occurred, reportedly related to the pepperballs or fall related injuries. Meanwhile, at a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Rochester, New York, 74 people were arrested for a variety of charges, including disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, police chief Michael Ciminelli said at a press conference early Saturday. Chief Ciminelli said 112 officers covered the gathering, including state police and members of town police departments. No officers were injured and there was no property damage, even though some protesters threw rocks at police officers. After the size and intensity of the rally grew, officers eventually were put into protective gear. It took police officers about three hours to clear the area. Some of those arrested were detained on sidewalks in handcuffs before being hauled into police vans. Two locals reporters were arrested but Ciminellu apologized, and they were subsequently released. In Baton Rouge, hundreds of protesters who descended upon the vicinity of police headquarters clashed with riot gear-wearing officers, who reportedly detained at least a dozen individuals. A group of protesters formed a human chain on one street, sitting down to block the street. It was then then that two officers tried to grab a young woman (video below), but other protesters wrestled her away. During that scuffle, one officer drew his weapon, upping the intensity of the situation, but the weapon was later reholstered. An officer also pulled out their stun gun and pointed it at a protester. And in Baltimore, about 200 people assembled at McKeldin Square (below) Friday night, marching from there to police headquarters. After a couple of hours, some members of the group failed to comply with officers and refused to move from out of the roadway, resulting in the arrest of four individuals, according to police. In Atlanta, a peaceful march of more than a thousand people – organized by the NAACP and Black Lives Matter -- kicked off at Centennial Olympic Park at 6 p.m. and didn""t dissipate for another nine hours, according to ABC Atlanta affiliate WSB-TV. The march was relatively peaceful, with only some protesters blocking an exit to I-75. At 11:25 p.m. Atlanta police chief George Turner said there were no arrests, but by Saturdat morning, WSB-TV was reporting there were a ""few arrests."" The exact number remained unknown. In California, events were held in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento. In L.A. rappers Snoop Dogg and The Game led a march to police headquarters, where they met with mayor Eric Garcetti, LAPD chief Charlie Beck and other city officials (below). ""We are here to show love and support to the Los Angeles Police Department,"" Snoop Dogg said. ""Thank y""all for allowing us to have conversation. We appreciate it."" About 2,000 protesters marched across downtown San Francisco to a rally outside City Hall under a huge banner that read, ""Stop the Racist Police Terror in the U.S."" Black Lives Matter supporters descended upon President Barack Obama's Chicago home, where activist Jedidiah Brown said there is more the president can do to combat deaths of African-Americans at the hands of police. In another demonstration, activist priest the Rev. Michael Pfleger and actor Nick Cannon led 100 people through the city's violence-plagued Auburn-Gresham neighborhood. ""It's very apparent that we're all in pain and we're frustrated,"" Cannon said. Other notable demonstrations included those in Detroit's Campus Martius Park, attended by 1,000 people, as well as protests in New York City's Union Square and Omaha, each attended by about 300 people. In Pittsburgh, 150 people peacefully marched downtown, and in Washington, D.C., a few dozen people rallied outside the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as The White House. And the Black Lives Matter movement even drew supporters overseas, with hundreds of people marching through central London, as drivers honked their horns in support.

Zianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears streaking her face, brought into focus the stress police shootings place on children, as well as the pain the black community of Charlotte has suffered in the wake of Scott's death last week. ""I""ve been born and raised in Charlotte. And I never felt this way until now and I can""t stand how we""re treated,"" the grade-school girl said, wiping away tears. She expressed the hardship that children face when a parent dies. Scott himself, who was African-American, had seven children. ""It""s a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. And we have tears. We shouldn""t have tears. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side,"" she said. Zianna, as well as the protesters in the room who chanted ""no justice, no peace"" after she spoke, helped to underscore the degree to which communal wounds have been slow to heal in North Carolina""s most populous city since the shooting. Protests started on the streets of Charlotte after news of Scott's shooting broke last Tuesday and, occasionally, became violent as they continued deeper into the week. The scene grew especially tense Wednesday night when police clad in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators. Some people in the crowds threw bottles and rocks at officers and passing cars, blocked an interstate highway, surrounded and jumped on vehicles, looted businesses and stormed the entrance of a Hyatt hotel, injuring two of its employees. At the city council meeting, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts called for decorum at several points during public remarks. At several points, protesters yelled criticism of her and Police Chief Kerr Putney. After the meeting wrapped up, The Charlotte Observer reported, more than 20 protesters moved to the lobby of the Government Center. ""Release. Release. The whole damn tape,"" the protesters chanted, according to the newspaper. Ray Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, Monday called for the release of the entire video of his shooting in an interview with ABC News. Chief Putney has released body and dashboard camera videos of the fatal police shooting of Scott, answering to demands made by community leaders, protesters and politicians. But it is not entirely clear from those videos or from the one taken by Scott's wife, Rakeiya Scott, that the victim had a gun on his person, as the police allege. It is also not entirely clear that he brandished it in such a way that would have posed a threat to the officers who approached him."
abc|"— -- Keith Lamont Scott's alleged possession of a firearm at the time of his shooting death would not on its own be a reason to forcibly disarm him, according to two legal experts. Police announced on Saturday that lab analysis revealed the presence of Scott's DNA and fingerprints on a loaded handgun recovered from the scene by investigators. Charlotte Police Chief Kerr Putney released body and dashboard camera videos of the fatal police shooting of Scott, answering to demands made by community leaders, protesters and politicians, but it is not entirely clear from those videos or from the one taken by Scott's wife, Rakeiya Scott, that the victim had a gun or that he brandished it in a way that would pose a threat to the officers who approached him. Police also released evidence of an ankle holster and a marijuana cigarette. Police have alleged that Keith Lamont Scott was rolling a ""blunt"" in his car. ABC News spoke to E. Gregory Wallace, a professor at Campbell University School of Law in North Carolina, and Joseph E. Kennedy, a law professor at the University of North Carolina, about the state's open-carry gun laws, and they agreed that short of brandishing a gun, the presence of a handgun on Scott would not on its own justify an attempt by officers to disarm him. States like California and New York bar carrying handguns in public, and some states allow open carry with a license. North Carolina is among 31 states that do not require a license for open carry. There are limitations to the law, however; criminal history, drug use or immigration status can forfeit a person's right to carry a gun. Wallace noted that if the police saw the marijuana cigarette in combination with the gun, it might be enough to justify forcibly disarming Scott because of the implication of illegal activity, but police would have needed to see both at the same time. ""The mere display of a firearm in the city of Charlotte doesn't give police cause to detain or disarm a citizen,"" Wallace said. Wallace said the videos fail to show the encounter that led to his shooting, leaving many questions about the incident unanswered. Wallace separates the incident into two parts: the decision to disarm Scott, followed by the decision to shoot. ""The video doesn't cover any time prior to having guns drawn,"" he said. ""My question is, What was the cause of the initial approach?"" The video released by police shows Scott exiting a white SUV. He backs away from it with his hands at his sides and doesn't appear to be acting in a threatening manner. Officers can be heard shouting, ""Drop the gun!"" in the video. Scott was shot multiple times. He can be heard in the video moaning in pain as officers put handcuffs on him. Kennedy told ABC News that in North Carolina, someone may legally challenge a police officer's request to put a gun down. ""Having a gun makes you armed, but it doesn't necessarily make you dangerous,"" he said. He spoke critically of open-carry laws and said that the laws put both citizens and police officers in an ""impossible situation"" because of the legal justification for citizens to be armed in public. He added that without a gun in Scott's hand, the shooting of him should be considered ""grossly negligent"" on the part of police. Wallace said that if it could be determined that Scott had his weapon in his holster at the time of the shooting, it would be a ""game changer,"" noting that it would not have put the police in enough danger to warrant shooting him. Ray Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, called today for the release of the full police video, saying he hopes that Americans will take ""an absolute unflinching look"" at prejudice and police-involved shootings and that ""we as a nation tell the truth about who we are."" It is unclear whether the full video will make clear what happened during the initial approach to Scott's vehicle and whether he had a gun in his hand at the time he was shot by police."
abc|"A video of a white couple confronting a person of color stenciling Black Lives Matter in chalk outside his San Francisco home has been viewed more than 12 million times. James Juanillo posted the video to his Twitter account late last week. In the nearly 2-minute video of the June 9 incident, a woman and man ask if that is his property and if he is ""defacing private property."" ""If I did live here, and it was my property, this would be absolutely fine?"" Juanillo can be heard asking them. ""And you don't know if I live here, or if this is my property?"" The woman, who identifies herself as Lisa in the video, says she knows ""the person who lives there."" Juanillo encourages them to call the cops and they walk off. In an interview with San Francisco ABC station KGO, Juanillo said the cops did arrive shortly after and they recognized each other. ""They did not even get out of the car,"" said Juanillo. Juanillo called the incident ""polite racism."" ""What she did was everyday,"" he told KGO. ""It's polite racism. It's respectable racism. 'Respectfully, sir, I don't think you belong here at all.'"" He said if he was able to speak with the woman, he would ask her ""why?"" ""Why did she feel that what I was doing hurt her?"" he said. KGO reported that the woman in the video is Lisa Alexander, who is the owner of the skin care brand Laface according to the subscription service Birchbox. Following the release of the video, Birchbox said it officially cut ties with the brand. In a statement to KGO, Alexander apologized for her actions and said that she ""should have minded her own business."" ""The last 48 hours has taught me that my actions were those of someone who is not aware of the damage caused by being ignorant and naive to racial inequalities,"" said the statement. ""When I watch the video I am shocked and sad that I behaved the way I did. It was disrespectful to Mr. Juanillo and I am deeply sorry for that."" ""I did not realize at the time that my actions were racist and have learned a painful lesson,"" it continued. Alexander said in the statement that she wants to have coffee with Juanillo and apologize in person. Juanillo has yet to respond publicly to her offer. The episode marks the latest in a string of viral videos on social media showing encounters in which white people have called 911 to report people of color in seemingly everyday scenarios. Last month, a cellphone video capturing a white dog owner in New York City's Central Park calling 911 and claiming an African American birdwatcher was ""threatening myself and my dog"" went viral. The woman, Amy Cooper, was fired from her job and later apologized."
ny_post|"Those protesting the St. Louis grand jury""s decision now have a new chant: ""black lives matter."" Of course they do. But the protesters have the equation backward. It""s not policing that is the threat to black life today. More often, it""s the lack of policing. President Obama spoke to this truth after the grand jury""s decision Monday, noting that ""nobody needs good policing more than poor communities with higher crime rates."" Unfortunately, too many American cities leave their most vulnerable communities under-policed and under-protected. Starting with Mayor Rudy Giuliani and then-Commissioner Bill Bratton, New York chose a different route: Police would go where the criminals were. Murder rates began dropping, and Mayor Mike Bloom­­berg and Commissioner Ray Kelly built on this success to take them to record lows. Because of this work, there are hundreds of black citizens walking around today who would likely be dead otherwise. That""s the basis of Giuliani""s claim that he ""saved more black lives than anyone as mayor"" — with the possible exception of Bloomberg. So yes, black lives matter. And though police must always look for ways to improve ties with the communities they serve, the truth is this: Because the NYPD refused to write off minority neighborhoods to hoodlums, no big city in America has a better claim to protecting black life than ours."
ny_post|"Mayor de Blasio did it again. He implicitly endorsed another slur against cops — this time, that they ""intentionally discriminate"" against minorities. He did this in his settlement of the remaining stop-and-frisk case, Davis v. the City of New York. This suit accuses cops of overly aggressive, race-based stops and trespassing arrests in public-housing buildings. Under the settlement, the NYPD will change its rules, making it harder for cops to detain or arrest suspects in these buildings. It will also pay out $270,000 to some defendants. As bad as the slur on the cops may be, it""s the residents — minority kids and grandmothers — who""ll suffer most. Without aggressive policing, the lobbies and stairwells of these buildings can turn into hangouts for dangerous gang members or others who make life miserable for everyone else living there. Residents know this well: A 2012 survey showed 65 percent of residents felt the steps in place back then to stop trespassers weren""t tough enough. ""Trespassers make it unsafe,"" one complained. Another demanded greater ""police presence during the evenings to stop drug dealing and groups loitering."" Yet this week""s settlement will likely just lead to more trespassing — and more crime, large and small — in public housing, not less. Back during the campaign, de Blasio and the other Democratic candidates spent a night in an East Harlem public-housing project. Two days later, an African-American woman was shot dead in the same project. If black lives matter, shouldn""t New York be helping cops keep these areas safe rather than making the jobs there more difficult?"
ny_post|"If the Black Lives Matter crowd is correct, bloodthirsty, racist cops are blasting black men like clay pigeons at a shooting range. The pace of this alleged slaughter is breathtaking. ""Every 28 hours, a black person is murdered by police,"" Black Lives Matter activist Cherno Biko told Fox News Channel""s Megyn Kelly. ""It feels like we""re in a war."" If true, killer cops are rubbing out some 313 innocent, law-abiding blacks annually. Rise Up October asserts that there are ""over 1,000 people a year killed by police."" Wrong! And more than doubly so. University of Toledo criminologist Dr. Richard R. Johnson examined the latest data from the FBI and Centers for Disease Control. From 2003 through 2012, law-enforcement officers killed an average of 429 people per year in ""legal interventions."" These include a relatively small number of innocent people killed by cops and many more who died due to reasonable use of force. When a bank robber thrusts a loaded Glock into a teller""s neck, that""s a really good time for the police to kill him. Anti-police protesters chant the well-known names of several black males who lately have died at the hands of cops: Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Tamir Rice and Walter Scott. Some cops (such as Darren Wilson, who shot Michael Brown) have been exonerated, even by Obama""s Justice Department. Others face trial — such as Officer Michael Slager, who shot Walter Scott in the back in North Charleston, SC, and the three white and three black Baltimore cops in whose custody Freddie Gray died. What this controversy sorely needs is a strong dose of facts. Actual crime data reveal that this movement is based on mythology. Thanks to the Ferguson Effect, blistering anti-law-enforcement rhetoric and sometimes fatal attacks on police have made cops timid, if not terrified. The result? A murder explosion that, ironically, is killing the very black people whom Black Lives Matter claims to champion. Year to date, homicides are up 8.3 percent in New York, 19.2 percent in Chicago, 51.5 percent in St. Louis and 52.5 percent in Baltimore. On average, 4,472 black men were killed by other black men annually between Jan. 1, 2009, and Dec. 31, 2012, according to the FBI""s Supplementary Homicide Reports. Using FBI and CDC statistics, Professor Johnson calculates that 112 black men, on average, suffered both justified and unjustified police-involved deaths annually during this period. This equals 2.5 percent of these 4,472 yearly deaths. For every black man — criminal or innocent — killed by a cop, 40 black men were murdered by other black men. The, at most, 2.5 percent of the problem generates relentless rage. And, yet, it is rude-to-racist to mention 97.5 percent of the problem. As America""s largest police force, one would expect the NYPD to be a major player in this alleged mass murder of innocent blacks. Wrong again! The supposedly trigger-happy, bigoted NYPD killed a whopping eight people last year, according to its meticulous, 73-page ""2014 Annual Firearms Discharge Report."" Of these, four were black. All of them were armed with cutting instruments (scissors, a hatchet, a boxcutter and a knife) and wielded them when they fatally were shot. Rather than NYPD gunfire, the high-profile Eric Garner case involved a police chokehold that may have given the overweight Garner a lethal coronary. Still, these five deaths (at least four of them justified) total last year""s NYPD ""genocide"" against black men. They equal 4.95 percent of Gotham""s 101 black-on-black murders in 2014. Other blacks are 20 times deadlier to black New Yorkers than is the NYPD. Yes, some police are overzealous, twitchy-fingered and — surely — racist. NYPD Officer James Frascatore""s heavy-handed takedown of tennis player James Blake outside a Manhattan hotel in September confirms that some cops need leashes. But the notion that America""s cops simply are gunning down innocent black people is one of today""s biggest and deadliest lies. Deroy Murdock is a Manhattan-based Fox News contributor."

Alston had never been to a protest before, but after watching the Black Lives Matter movement""s momentum grow following George Floyd""s May 25 death, she wanted to be a part of it. ""I never went out to protest before, but I was like, ""This is the time,'"" she tells Insider. ""Seeing police brutality hits close to home because it could be anybody.""

ny_post|"Talk about missing the point. An international journal devoted to politics and philosophy is apologizing for publishing an issue on the Black Lives Matter movement without a black author""s perspective, calling the glaring omission a ""grave"" oversight. Robert Goodin, editor of the Journal of Political Philosophy, posted an open letter to apologize on a philosophy blog on Thursday after a professor of African-American studies and philosophy at Yale and others criticized the absence of black voices in its June issue. ""We accept the point eloquently and forcefully made by our colleagues that this is an especially grave oversight in light of the specific focus of Black Lives Matter on the extent to which African-Americans have been erased and marginalized from public life,"" the apology reads. ""Part of the mission of the JPP is to raise awareness of ongoing injustices in our societies. We appreciate and encourage having an engaged and politically active scholarly community willing to hold everyone working in the profession to account."" To avoid such gaffes in the future, the journal has scheduled a meeting with its editors to review procedures for its symposiums, which are ""plainly inadequate,"" according to Goodin""s statement. The journal will also invite at least two African-American philosophers to its editorial board, which currently consists of six people of color, but no African-American thinkers. ""More generally, we will be working harder to encourage work from philosophers and political theorists of color as we have done with women and young scholars in the past, and we will revise our editorial guidelines to reflect this commitment,"" Goodin""s statement continued. The striking exclusion of black voices in the issue caught the eye of Chris Lebron, an assistant professor at Yale who recently published a book on the philosophical foundation of the movement. ""So, if you might – please do – try to imagine my distaste when it was brought to my attention that your journal published a philosophical symposium on ""black lives matter"" with not one philosopher of color represented, without one philosopher of color to convey her or his contextualized sense of a movement that is urgently and justifiably about context,"" Lebron wrote. ""It certainly cannot be said there was no one to ask. I should know."" Lebron, who will join Johns Hopkins University as an associate professor of philosophy later this summer, also claimed that the quarterly journal has not published a single essay on the philosophy of race, despite articles on other topics like voting, elections, immigration and even a special issue on philosophy, politics and society. ""You can see, then, how at this point the generous reading of the mishandling of the symposium comes under significant pressure,"" Lebron""s post continued. ""So much pressure, in fact, that it becomes compressed into something else: strained hope. The hope that intelligent and imaginative people can see the landscape of morality in its complexity and be sensitive to life-worlds beyond their range of experience."" A message seeking additional comment from Goodin was not immediately returned."
ny_post|"First published by the Washington Examiner Sept. 3. The Black Lives Matter movement has been feted repeatedly at the White House and honored at the Democratic National Convention. Hillary Clinton has incorporated its claims about racist, homicidal cops into her presidential campaign pitch. This summer""s assassinations of police officers haven""t slowed the anti-cop demonstrations or diminished the virulent hatred directed at cops during those protests. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refuses to stand for the national anthem to protest the alleged oppression of blacks, while pop singer Beyoncé has made the Black Lives Matter movement the focal point of her performances. Yet the Black Lives Matter movement is based on a lie. The idea that the United States is experiencing an epidemic of racially driven police shootings is false — and dangerously so. The facts are these: Last year, the police shot 990 people, the vast majority armed or violently resisting arrest, according to the Washington Post""s database of fatal police shootings. Whites made up 49.9 percent of those victims, blacks 26 percent. That proportion of black victims is lower than what the black violent crime rate would predict. Blacks constituted 62 percent of all robbery defendants in America""s 75 largest counties in 2009, 57 percent of all murder defendants and 45 percent of all assault defendants, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, even though blacks comprise only 15 percent of the population in those counties. In New York City, where blacks make up 23 percent of the city""s population, blacks commit three-quarters of all shootings and 70 percent of all robberies, according to victims and witnesses in their reports to the NYPD. Whites, by contrast, commit less than 2 percent of all shootings and 4 percent of all robberies, though they are nearly 34 percent of the city""s population. In Chicago, 80 percent of all known murder suspects in 2015 were black, as were 80 percent of all known nonfatal shooting suspects, though they""re a little less than a third of the population. Whites made up 0.9 percent of known murder suspects in Chicago in 2015 and 1.4 percent of known nonfatal shooting suspects, though they are about a third of the city""s residents. Gang shootings occur almost exclusively in minority areas. Police use of force is most likely in confrontations with violent and resisting criminals, and those confrontations happen disproportionately in minority communities. But the Black Lives Matter narrative has nevertheless had an enormous effect on policing and public safety, despite its mendacity. Gun-related murders of officers are up 52 percent this year through Aug. 30 compared to last year. The cop assassinations are only a more extreme version of the Black Lives Matter-inspired hatred that officers working in urban areas encounter on a daily basis. Officers are routinely surrounded by hostile, jeering crowds when they try to conduct a street investigation or make an arrest. Resistance to arrest is up, officers report. Cops have been repeatedly told by President Obama and the media that pedestrian stops and public order enforcement are racist. In consequence, they are doing less of those discretionary activities in high-crime minority communities. The result? Violent crime is rising in cities with large black populations. Homicides in 2015 rose anywhere from 54 percent in Washington, DC, to 90 percent in Cleveland. In the nation""s 56 largest cities, homicides rose 17 percent in 2015, a nearly unprecedented one-year spike. In the first half of 2016, homicides in 51 large cities were up another 15 percent compared to the same period last year. The carnage has continued this year. In Chicago alone, at least 15 children under the age of 12 have been shot in the first seven months of 2016, including a 3-year-old boy who is now paralyzed for life following a Father""s Day drive-by shooting. While the world knows Michael Brown, whose fatal police shooting in Ferguson, Mo., spurred Black Lives Matter, few people outside these children""s immediate communities know their names. Black Lives Matter activists have organized no protests to stigmatize their assailants. For the past two decades, the country has been talking about phantom police racism in order to avoid talking about a more uncomfortable truth: black crime. But in the era of data-driven law enforcement, policing is simply a function of crime. The best way to lower police-civilian contacts in inner-city neighborhoods would be for children to be raised by their mother and their father in order to radically lower the crime rate there. Here""s a broader look at violent crime across the country: Heather Mac Donald is the author of the newly released ""The War on Cops."""
ny_post|"Black Lives Matter, the slogan of the movement that began in earnest after the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., is a lie. Taken at face value, the phrase is a truism, since obviously all lives matter. But the people who use it as a shibboleth don""t care about black lives per se so much as scoring points against the police. When there is some awful tragedy involving a cop shooting or harming a young black man (sometimes justifiably, sometimes not), they muster every ounce of their moral dudgeon and stage demonstrations eagerly covered by a sympathetic media. Baltimore was an obsession of the Black Lives Matter crowd and of the news media after the death of Freddie Gray from a terrible injury suffered in police custody. But now that 35 people have been murdered in the month of May, the highest in a month since 1999, the response has been muted. A few Baltimore organizations are staging anti­violence protests, but they won""t command major media attention. There have been headlines and TV reports about the killing spree, but not ubiquitous calls for yet another national ""conversation."" Let""s be honest: Some black lives really don""t matter. If you are a young black man shot in the head by another young black man, almost certainly no one will know your name. Al Sharpton won""t come rushing to your family""s side with cameras in tow. MSNBC won""t discuss the significance of your death. No one will protest, or even riot, for you. You are a statistic, not a cause. Just another dead black kid, politically useless to progressives and the media, therefore all but invisible. The same Memorial Day weekend when nine mostly young people were murdered in Baltimore, demonstrators were out in force — not to protest the violence, of course, but the state of Maryland funding a youth jail in a city that rather desperately needs a youth jail. Just as the Freddie Gray unrest was initially stoked by an inadequate police response, the wave of shootings has been enabled by less aggressive police patrols. According to The Baltimore Sun, arrests have dropped by about half in May. The implication is clear: More people need to be arrested in Baltimore, not fewer.
And more need to be jailed. If black lives truly matter, Baltimore needs more and better policing and incarceration to prevent a lawless few from spreading mayhem and death. Why have the police pulled back? Baltimore""s police commissioner, according to the Sun, has said that in West Baltimore ""officers have been routinely surrounded by dozens of people, video cameras and hostility while performing basic police work."" Daniel Webster of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research told Vice News that he thinks the rioting carried its own toxic message of disrespect for the law. Meanwhile, anonymous police officers say they feel that city authorities don""t have their back, understandably enough when Baltimore City State""s Attorney Marilyn Mosby rushed to announce charges against the Freddie Gray officers to placate the mob. It is wrong for the police to shrink from doing their job, but the past month in Baltimore shows how important that job is. This is especially true in dangerous, overwhelmingly black neighborhoods. They need disproportionate police attention, even if that attention is easily mischaracterized as racism. The alternative is a deadly chaos that destroys and blights the lives of poor blacks.
It is a paradox that a figure who is anathema to the Black Lives Matter movement, Rudy Giuliani, saved more black lives than any of his critics ever will. He did it by getting the police to establish and maintain basic order and defending the cops when the likes of Al Sharpton maligned them. Now that Mayor de Blasio has pulled back, shootings are trending up in New York City. But it""s OK, as long as nameless young black men are the ones being shot at. For progressives, only some black lives matter."
cbs|"Once upon a time in New York, Chicago, and other large tightly-packed cities, tuberculosis and pneumonia ran rampant. Nearly 25% of African American deaths at the turn of the 20th century in New York were from tuberculosis. As one prescription, community leader Conrad Norman and others advocated physical activity. In 1904, Norman established the Alpha Physical Culture Club in Harlem and fielded a basketball team known as the Alpha Big Five. The Alphas, the Savoy Big Five, the Second Story Morrys, and dozens of other hoops teams thrived during the Black Fives Era – a period of basketball before the NBA launched in 1946 and became integrated four years later. ""Fives"" is a reference to the five starting players in basketball. Barred from the Whites-only gymnasiums and athletic clubs, Black Fives teams played in church basements, armories, meeting halls and dance ballrooms. Rather than just isolated basketball games, these bonafide events also involved music and dance before and after games during an age of jazz — a celebration that sounds like NBA All-Star Weekend. Today, Black NBA players have achieved royalty status around the world. And many of the league's biggest stars have spoken out forcefully against social injustice during an era of Black Lives Matter. But compared to the storied Negro Leagues of baseball, the history of the Black Fives has largely flown under the radar. Claude Johnson, a longtime marketing executive who once worked at the NBA, has made it his mission to change that. His Black Fives Foundation focuses on honoring the pre-NBA history of African Americans in hoops. The nonprofit recently entered into a multi-year partnership with Puma in support of Black history education reform, using the legacy of Black basketball to connect the current generation to the past. ""The Black Fives played somewhat comparable roles in the Black community to what the Negro Leagues and sandlot baseball had done,"" said Rob Ruck, a sports history professor at the University of Pittsburgh. The Black Fives built community, celebrated culture and created wealth. Ruck thinks that one reason this history has been slow to surface is that hoops didn't really grab the American psyche until the Jordan era. ""Intelligentsia was fixated on baseball. Novels. Movies. Archives. But there was none of that for basketball. It just didn't have that grip,"" Ruck adds. Johnson, a Stanford-trained engineer, initially juggled his day job while moonlighting at Schomburg Center in Harlem, combing through archives. He secured much of the foundation's 1,000 artifacts, including photographs, ticket stubs, laced balls and footwear, through auctions, families of descendants and eBay. One discovery, Edwin ""Teddy"" Horne, was a founding member of Smart Set Athletic Club, and father of Lena Horne. Eventually, Johnson's hard work started paying off. In 2013, when Barclays Center emerged as the new home for the Brooklyn Nets, over 40 descendants from the Smart Set Athletic Club, Spartan Girls Club (an all Black women's team), and others were honored. Life-size murals were added to the concourse of the new arena. One year later, Johnson served as guest curator of the ""Black Fives"" exhibition at New-York Historical Society. But as far as a full-throated integration of Black Fives history into the NBA, this hasn't happened yet. ""I can't say I have a ton of explicit conversations about the origins of Black basketball,"" says Sherrie Deans, the acting chief operating officer of the National Basketball Players Association and executive director of the NBPA Foundation. Deans is doing her part to unearth some of this history, including funding a documentary on Earl Lloyd, the first Black American to play in the NBA. She also approved an NBPA Foundation grant to support Johnson's work at the Black Fives Foundation. To date, 12 players from the Black Fives Era have been posthumously inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, including Cumberland Posey Jr. of Pittsburgh, an all-around athlete also enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame. ""The mystic wand of Posey ruled basketball with as much eclat as 'Rasputin' dominated the Queen of all the Russias,"" so declared Harlem publication The Interstate Tattler in 1929. Sam Presti, the wunderkind general manager of the Oklahoma City Thunder, who drafted Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook, wants to elevate the history of the Fives. Presti became interested in the late John McClendon, the pioneering Black basketball coach, and invited Johnson to Oklahoma City to share the history of the Black Fives to Thunder players and staff. ""I think the history is so rich and meaningful that there would be a strong interest in taking it to maybe a broader and a centralized level, but I can't speak for the league office,"" Presti said. The Brooklyn Nets, Washington Wizards and New Orleans Pelicans have also expressed interest in Black Fives, according to Johnson. Johnson believes the constant movement in today's game — especially to free up outside shooters or to set up the pick and roll — was born during the Black Fives Era. And while younger fans claim that LeBron James could have been dominant in football, Jackie Robinson actually played professional basketball as a member of the Los Angeles Red Devils. Some historians say he shot a Spalding even better than he hit a Rawlings. Back at that Black Fives Barclay's event, John B. King Jr., the secretary of education under former President Barack Obama, honored his late uncle Dolly King, a star for the New York Renaissance. From 1923 to 1948, mainly playing on the road against all White competition, the ""Rens"" won a whopping 83% of their nearly 3,000 games. For King, the Black Fives represent Black excellence and a reminder that while racism has always been a reality of the Black experience in America, it is not the sole reality. ""It's important to hear the story of the Black Fives,"" King said. ""The narrative of the African-American experience is about facing these barriers, building vibrant alternate institutions, and then overcoming racism to demand a seat at the table."""
cbs|"A North Carolina deputy shot and killed a Black man while serving a search warrant Wednesday, authorities said, spurring an outcry from community members who demanded the immediate release of body camera footage. Authorities in Elizabeth City didn't provide details of the shooting. But an eyewitness said that Andrew Brown Jr. was shot while trying to drive away, and that deputies fired at him multiple times. The car skidded out of Brown's yard and eventually hit a tree, said Demetria Williams, who lives on the same street. Williams said after hearing one gunshot, she ran outside, where she saw other shots being fired at the car. ""When they opened the door he was already dead,"" Williams told The Associated Press. ""He was slumped over."" She said officers tried to perform chest compressions on him. A car authorities removed from the scene appeared to have multiple bullet holes and a broken rear windshield. An unspecified number of Pasquotank County Sheriff's deputies were placed on leave pending a review by the State Bureau of Investigation, Sheriff Tommy Wooten II said Thursday. Court records show Brown was 42 years old and had a history of drug charges and a misdemeanor drug possession conviction. Pasquotank County Chief Deputy Daniel Fogg said the warrant was ""surrounding felony drug charges."" ""Mr. Brown was a convicted felon with a history of resisting arrest,"" Fogg said in a video statement released Thursday. ""Our training and our policies indicate that under such circumstances, there is a high risk of danger."" Dozens of people gathered at the scene of the shooting in Elizabeth City, a municipality of about 18,000 people 170 miles northeast of Raleigh, where they expressed their anger and rallied around Brown's family members. The city's population is more than 50% Black and about 40% white, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Nearly 23% of residents live in poverty. A large crowd later stood outside City Hall while the City Council held an emergency meeting, some holding signs proclaiming ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Stop killing unarmed Black Men."" As the evening wore on, a group gathered in the parking lot of the sheriff's office and a crowd that grew to more than 200 blocked traffic on a main thoroughfare of the city, forcing cars to turn around. ""The police didn't have to shoot my baby,"" said Martha McCullen, an aunt of Brown who said she raised him after his parents died. McCullen stood on the stoop of Brown's rental home, her eyes moist with emotion. ""Andrew Brown was a good person,"" she said. ""He was about to get his kids back. He was a good father. Now his kids won't never see him again."" Wooten said deputies shot Brown at about 8:30 a.m. He said there is body camera footage of the shooting, but said he had not viewed the footage himself, CBS affiliate WNCN-TV reports. ""The sheriff's office trusts the ability of our North Carolina State Bureau of Investigations and we will be transparent and we will take the proper actions based on the findings of that investigation,"" Wooten said. Williams, the eyewitness who also was among those demonstrating outside City Hall on Wednesday evening, said Brown, who was known by neighbors as ""Drew,"" wasn't a violent person. ""I didn't believe that (officers) really did that because he wasn't a threat to them. He was driving off even though he was trying to get away,"" Williams said. During the emergency meeting, Black members of the City Council spoke emotionally about the fears of their community amid multiple police shootings across the country and implored investigators to remain transparent. ""I'm afraid as a Black man,"" an emotional Councilman Gabriel Adkins told his colleagues. ""I'm afraid that I may be the next one that my family might have to see on the news that I was gunned down."" Adkins said businesses in the neighborhood of the shooting had begun boarding up their windows in anticipation of violence. ""Not only do we need transparency ... we need accountability,"" said City Councilman Darius Horton, who called for the immediate release of bodycam footage, the search warrant and a speedy explanation of what led to the shooting. ""We need answers. ... Let's not hide behind anything."" Among those who gathered at the scene of the shooting was Keith Rivers, president of the Pasquotank County chapter of the NAACP. ""When is it going to stop? We just got a verdict yesterday,"" Rivers said in a phone interview, referring to the guilty verdicts handed down Tuesday in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd. ""Is it open season now? At some point, it has to stop. We have to start holding the people in charge accountable."" The State Bureau of Investigation will turn the findings of its review over to District Attorney Andrew Womble, who pledged a thorough and deliberate inquiry. ""What we are looking for at this time will be accurate answers and not fast answers,"" Womble told a news conference. ""We're going to wait for the full and complete investigation ... and we'll review that and make any determinations that we deem appropriate at that time. This will not be a rush to judgment."""
cbs|"The national Black Lives Matter foundation raised more than $90 million dollars in 2020, with an average donation of about $30, the organization announced in a report Tuesday. Millions were donated to local organizations and local Black Lives Matter chapters in an effort to uplift the community. ""This has been a record-breaking year for fundraising, which has been matched with just as historic an amount in campaign budgets and grant disbursements,"" the organization wrote in its 2020 Impact Report. The announcement follows a year where protests swept the nation, with calls for racial justice and policing reform. The foundation said its website saw a nearly 5,000% increase in traffic, with over 24 million visiting the website to learn more during the second half of 2020. The donations were made up of both partner and individual donations — 10% were recurring, the report said. The foundation spent around $8.4 million in operating costs and committed about 23% of its total assets, leaving it with a fiscal balance of $60 million. Black Lives Matter also distributed $21.7 million to 30 organizations and local BLM chapters, 22 of which are led by LGBTQIA organizers. The report also outlined its impact with global partners, grassroots voting efforts like in the Georgia runoff, and future plans for additional anti-racism policy to hopefully be implemented at both the state and national level. ""Many elected officials remain fearful of the phrase 'Black Lives Matter' and refuse to act with all that it takes to sustain Black life and Black joy,"" Patrice Cullors, co-founder and executive director, wrote in the report. ""We will no longer wait until this moment comes. We will create it."""
npr|"Robert E. Lee High School in Jacksonville, Fla., was segregated — whites only — until the 1971-1972 school year. Its school colors are blue and gray, the colors of the Confederacy, and its sports teams are called the Generals. But a lot has changed since the 1970s: Now, the student body is 70% Black. Students run an Instagram page to document racism they experience at school. And a student group called the EVAC Movement, focused on reframing Black youth in Jacksonville from ""at risk"" to ""at hope,"" met with then-President Barack Obama in 2016 and presented before the U.S. Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. In January 2020, a former member of the EVAC Movement, Reginald Boston, was killed by the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. That fall, Amy Donofrio, an English teacher at Lee and co-founder of the EVAC Movement, hung a Black Lives Matter flag outside her classroom to mark it as a safe space for students to process Boston's death. ""His life mattered. Period,"" Donofrio said. ""Walking beside his family, his mom, and seeing what it looks like in real life, there's no possible way that you can't stand by the belief that Black lives matter."" This March, Jacksonville's public school district told Donofrio to take the flag down, saying it violated district policy on political speech by employees. Donofrio said no. So she was taken out of the classroom and reassigned to non-teaching duties. Donofrio is now represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. The suit alleges the flag's removal was a violation of her First Amendment rights. Donofrio alleges that the school district consistently undermined the EVAC program by demoting it from a class to a club to an informal group, turning down private funding and blocking her from using non-teaching days to take students on field trips. It felt like the school didn't support its Black students. The conflict over the flag was just the final straw. ""It's a question of whether or not this is a matter of great public significance, whether or not this speech is protected,"" said Cathleen Scott, a civil rights attorney who is representing Donofrio alongside the Southern Poverty Law Center. ""Ms. Donofrio was speaking out against racism. And that's a very important value."" That argument might face an uphill battle in court, said Rachel Arnow-Richman, a professor of labor and employment law at the University of Florida. ""We think of the First Amendment as a foundational principle of our democracy, and it is, but it's subject to many limitations,"" Arnow-Richman said. Until recently, the free speech rights of public employees were balanced against the interests of the government as an employer. Courts could consider, on a case-by-case basis, whether a public employee's speech was disruptive to the government's interests in that workplace. But in 2006, the Supreme Court took the position that when they're on the job, public employees speak for the government, not themselves. Because of that case, Arnow-Richman said, ""public employment is one of the most profound limitations on First Amendment rights."" In her lawsuit, Donofrio is pushing back against that, citing a Florida statute that says school districts may not infringe upon school staff's rights under the Constitution in the absence of written consent. Arnow-Richman said the law may not have fully wrestled with society's conflicting goals. ""That's to say, this general rule that public employees do not speak for themselves but speak for the government and lack First Amendment protections is at odds, I would say, with our societal interest in wanting teachers to have leeway to communicate and teach students about current issues, bringing to bear their expertise as educators,"" the professor said. The school district declined to comment for this story. For Amiyah Jacobs, a senior at Robert E. Lee High, the Black Lives Matter flag was comforting and she felt the school taking it down was disrespectful. She said she missed seeing Donofrio at school. ""Since we are a Title I school, not everybody has access to the right resources. So she helps out with kids who need hygiene or food or even help applying to college,"" Jacobs said. ""She was just very sweet. And she cared for the students. It wasn't always just about 'Do your work.' "" Jacobs is one of more than 16,000 people who have signed a student-led petition to bring the teacher back to the classroom. Donofrio said it's stressful to sue her employer, but it also feels like a relief. ""There are educators all over this country that want to stand with our children, that are advocating for our children, and are being retaliated against and pushed back against as a result. And so my goal, my hope, is that by doing this, we can empower more educators to stand beside our kids."""
npr|"Bureaucratic prose is often written not to make things plain, but explain them away. It may be especially telling this week, when 12 jurors found former police officer Derek Chauvin guilty in the murder of George Floyd, to reread the first report the Minneapolis Police media relations office gave of Floyd's death. ""Man Dies After Medical Incident During Police Interaction,"" their May 25, 2020, bulletin began. They said officers responded to, ""a report of a forgery in progress. Officers were advised that the suspect was sitting on top of a blue car and appeared to be under the influence."" Let's make plain here that no testimony established that George Floyd was ""under the influence"" of anything that led to his death — he died because Chauvin crushed his knee into Floyd's neck and back on the street for more than nine minutes. Dr. Bill Smock, a forensic surgeon who appeared as a prosecution witness, told the court that when you see the video of George Floyd, he's not overdosing: ""He's breathing. He's talking. He's not snoring. He is saying, 'Please, please get off of me. I want to breathe. I can't breathe.' "" The police bulletin went on to say that the suspect, ""physically resisted officers. Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress."" As experts testified, Floyd's ""medical distress"" was caused by Chauvin, choking the life out of him, after he was already handcuffed. The report says, ""Officers called for an ambulance."" It does not say they administered CPR. But Smock pointed out that police officers have the training, and legal responsibility, to give medical care to anyone they take into custody, even before an ambulance arrives. A line near the end of that official report now sounds especially cold: ""No officers were injured in the incident."" John Elder, the Minneapolis Police Department's director of public information, told the Los Angeles Times last year he had simply relayed the information received from police on the scene. ""Had we known that this situation was what we saw on the video,"" he told the newspaper, ""that statement would have been completely different."" Of course it was because a 17-year-old named Darnella Frazier was on that corner and recorded what happened on her cellphone that Floyd's murder became known, a movement grew, and the man who killed him was held responsible. This week, you may wonder how many other killings dismissed in bureaucratic prose as, ""Medical Incident During Police Interaction,"" have just been filed away."
npr|"A new law in Oklahoma increases penalties for demonstrators who block public roadways and grants immunity to motorists who unintentionally kill or injure protesters while attempting to flee. Critics of the bill say it is intended to limit demonstrations and puts the people involved in them at risk. Gov. Kevin Stitt signed the legislation on Wednesday, making Oklahoma the latest Republican-led state to crack down on protests in the wake of last summer's nationwide demonstrations against racism and police violence. ""This is an important protection for citizens who are just trying to get out of a bad situation,"" state Rep. Kevin West, a sponsor of the bill, said in a statement. ""When fleeing an unlawful riot, they should not face threat of prosecution for trying to protect themselves, their families or their property."" Under the new law, obstructing the use of a public street or highway during a protest is considered a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in county jail and/or a fine ranging from $100 to $5,000. Another provision grants civil and criminal liability protection to motorists who unintentionally cause injury or death while ""fleeing from a riot."" State Sen. Rob Standridge, also a sponsor of the bill, said in a video recording that it sets a high bar. The harm must be unintentional, he stressed, and the vehicle occupants must feel like they are in imminent danger, ""like people are trying to break open the windows or trying to drag somebody out of the vehicle."" ""In those instances, and we've seen them, even here in Oklahoma, it does protect them,"" Standridge said. ""Hopefully everything quiets down around the country, and this bill won't be needed for anybody, but if things come to Oklahoma like have been happening, this will protect some folks."" The bill passed the state House and Senate largely along party lines, with no House Democrats voting in favor, and it will take effect on Nov. 1. It was introduced in response to a widely publicized incident in Tulsa last May when a pickup truck drove through a crowd that had gathered on an interstate to protest the police killing of George Floyd. The truck, which was pulling a horse trailer, hit and injured three people, including a 33-year-old man who was left paralyzed from the waist down after falling from an overpass. The Tulsa County District Attorney's Office announced in July it would not press charges against the driver, writing in a memo that he, his wife and two children were all ""in a state of immediate fear for their safety"" and had been the victims of a ""violent and unprovoked attack by multiple individuals who unnecessarily escalated an already dangerous circumstance by obstructing an interstate highway."" ""The prosecutor declined to file charges, but that may not always be the case,"" Standridge said. ""This bill will protect innocent people trapped by a rioting mob."" While similar incidents played out across the country last summer, data shows that the vast majority of protests associated with the Black Lives Matter movement have been peaceful. A report by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project found that demonstrators did not engage in violence or destructive activity in more than 93% of such gatherings in the period between May and late August. Critics of the law say it stifles protesters' First Amendment rights and worry it will disproportionately harm people of color, who are generally at the forefront of demonstrations calling for an end to racism in policing. ""In this state, it is oftentimes the marginalized voices that aren't oftentimes heard, and these are why they do the protests that they've done, this is why they speak on the things that they speak on,"" Joshua Harris-Till, president of Young Democrats of America and an Oklahoman, said in March, as Public Radio Tulsa reported. He called the bill ""the worst anti-protest bill in the nation"" in a tweet this month. Some 35 demonstrators marched through the state Capitol on Wednesday to protest several pieces of advancing legislation they described as ""anti-protest bills,"" The Oklahoman reported. Stitt also signed HB 1643, which makes it a crime to doxx police officers, or post anything online that could include personally identifying information with the intent to threaten, stalk or harass them. The American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma issued a statement when both bills passed the state Senate, describing lawmakers as ""trampling the rights and liberties of Oklahomans in favor of those with the most power and access, themselves included."" Advocates denounced the legislation as an effort to silence constituents' voices and criminalize their calls for racial justice. ""In a body that prides itself on prioritizing freedom, a majority of members of the Oklahoma Senate advanced key legislation today in an anti-freedom agenda unrivaled by any other state legislature in its unabashed attempts to center power, order, and white supremacy over the rights, liberties, and lives of Oklahomans, especially Black and Indigenous Oklahomans,"" said Nicole McAfee, director of policy and advocacy for the ACLU of Oklahoma. Several other states experienced high-profile clashes between protesters and motorists during last summer's nationwide reckoning over racial justice, during which blocking traffic was a commonly used tactic. In Minneapolis, for example, a tanker truck barreled through protesters marching on an interstate in June, though it left no serious injuries. Other incidents were deadlier: One person was killed and another injured when a man drove his car through protests on a Seattle freeway, and a man in St. Louis was fatally struck by a FedEx truck during demonstrations in May. Oklahoma is also not alone in advancing measures that critics say will stifle protests. The International Center for Not-for-Profit Law, which tracks state and federal initiatives limiting the right to protest, said there are more than 60 such measures currently pending across the country. Arkansas and Kansas recently passed laws strengthening penalties for protesters around gas and oil pipelines. And earlier this week, Florida's governor signed a law he called the ""strongest anti-rioting, pro-law enforcement measure in the country."""
npr|"On April 11, Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, was shot and killed by a police officer during a traffic stop in Brooklyn Center, Minn. It was the latest in a long line of killings of Black people by police in America. An officer's body camera captured footage of Wright's shooting, but podcast host Saidu Tejan-Thomas Jr., who lost a close friend from college to police violence a few years ago, doesn't plan on watching it. ""I choose not to put myself through that,"" he says. ""I know if I watch that, I'll just be frozen ... with grief and frozen with fear, too. And I can't move like that."" Tejan-Thomas Jr.'s ""Resistance"" podcast explores different aspects of the Black Lives Matter movement. The podcast has been mostly devoted to the protests that started last summer after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, but it also chronicles Tejan-Thomas Jr.'s personal history. Born in Sierra Leone, Tejan-Thomas Jr. experienced that country's civil war before coming to the U.S. at the age of 8. He says the violence Black people experience in America at the hands of police brings back traumatic memories from his childhood. ""I think it probably does tap into some more fundamental fear that I have of being killed unnecessarily and folks that I love being killed unnecessarily,"" he says. On his friend who was killed by police My friend was having a mental health episode, and he was going throughout Richmond with his clothes off ... he just took off his clothes and was running around Richmond because he was obviously experiencing something. And he drove on to the highway and I think he crashed into a tree and then he came out of his car. By that point, the police had been called and the policeman got out of his car and tried to Tase him, and I guess it didn't work. And so the policeman decided to shoot him. ... As far as I know, there wasn't any consequences. And for context, in a town not too far away from Richmond, there was a man who literally had the same thing happen. He was having a mental health episode and he fought with the cop, they engaged with him for a while using nonlethal forces and took him in. And he was a white man. So that ended very differently. And it was around the same time. On what he remembers of the war in Sierra Leone as a kid It's hard for me to fully characterize it, because I was like a kid, but what I do remember was when the war came, things changed really drastically, and we had to get out of the city and go to somewhere in the countryside where it was rumored to be safer. And one of the things we had to do was my dad gave me over to one of the people that he knew to smuggle me out of the city. And the way we did that was literally through the sewers, like we had to go down in the sewers and walk miles until it was safe and then come up somewhere where it was safe and then go meet .... whoever we were supposed to meet at the safer place. I remember the shooting. I remember the fires. I remember the uncertainty. And I was so young that I don't think I really wrapped my head around it because I was very much complaining about things like not having the kind of food that I was used to eating, because we had to ration food and eat ... meals that were easy to cook. All of that was happening. But it was because I was so young, I think I was just kind of like experiencing it and hoping that the people that I loved and myself, I was just hoping that we would be safe. And for the most part we were. But family members ... knew people who were actually really, really ravaged by the war. On the trauma he carries from the war I remember when I came to America ... open windows scared the hell out of me because I was afraid that bullets would fly through the window and hit me, or, like, somebody would be trying to pick me off through the window. I always ignored that feeling. But, yeah, it was definitely a result of the war, because one of the things we had to do was hide underneath our beds when the shooting was especially bad and you just couldn't go outside. All the windows were closed. ... I went back home recently, a couple of years ago, and there were still marks in the walls from where the bullets had hit the walls. And that really resonated with me because I was like, ""Oh, this was my childhood."" And for some reason I think I ignored a lot of that. I think it definitely, definitely traumatized me. On learning what it means to be Black in America I think I fell into the trap that a lot of Black and African immigrants do ... when we come here, which is that ... I knew that I was here to get an education, try to live a better life, and for the longest time, I don't really think I engaged with race. And I didn't really engage with what it meant to be Black in America. And, in fact, I think I thought that I was not Black ... and maybe that precluded me from whatever violence was going to happen, because I thought, ""Oh, whatever kind of racism happens in this country is obviously directed at African Americans. ... Whatever the hell is going on here, I'm not a part of it. ..."" As I got older, I expressed those views to other Black people, and they very clearly told me, ""Listen, when a cop sees you, he does not see an African immigrant. He doesn't see Sierra Leonean. He sees Black, like he sees you the same way he sees me. And when you are applying for a job, when you're doing all these things, people are not going to see you as separate from this because you are literally just the same as the rest of us. And you are not higher than us. You're not better than us."" And that took a while for me to really understand. And I think it was because part of it was ... there being a divide between me being African and people being African Americans and not feeling quite accepted in that community because of my difference. But after a while, I realized we're all on the same side, like, there's no difference between me being where I'm from and them being where they're from — and we're all faced with the same kind of threats. On writing a poem (""Play"") about being sexually abused by his uncle as a 6-year-old I hadn't spoken about that really with anybody. ... I was scared. I was freaking terrified of what reading this poem out loud could mean. I'm glad I wrote that poem. I'm glad it's out there. But ... it's a poem that I wrote before, I think, I was ready to write it. ... I got a lot of good responses from people who felt like they had had similar experiences and it touched them and that was really good. What I was afraid of was some of the things that I even explored in the poem, which was just like, if I put this poem out there, what does this poem about being sexually assaulted say about my masculinity? What does it say about me as a man? And what does it say about me as a Black man? Like, am I soft now? Am I just weaker because of this? Will people see me that way? But that's not at all how people responded to it. And I really appreciated that. On regretting getting rid of his accent I did have an accent, but I worked so hard to get rid of it because I think I really have an ear for sound I was really good at masking it and getting rid of it to the point where halfway through the school year, they forgot that I was an immigrant and they never put me in any English as a second language classes because I was just working so hard to get rid of it. And I regret it. I wish I still had my accent. I really wish I did ... because that's who I was and that's who I am. A lot of the time I do feel very distant from home. I do feel very distant from that part of me that I left back home and I feel like the accent is like a reminder of who you are and it's a reminder of where you come from and to own that and to embrace that I think is a powerful thing. But I was just so young and I wanted to fit in and I got rid of it. So I really regret that I did that. Heidi Saman and Kayla Lattimore produced and edited the audio of this interview.

npr|"As some of the most contentious Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 erupted in Portland, Ore., last spring, 29-year-old Cameron Whitten started getting a deluge of messages. Friends from all corners of his life were checking in on him. ""At first I was like, 'Did something happen to me?' "" says Whitten. Realizing people were just concerned about his well-being, he reached out to other Black people to ask: ""Are you having white people message you too?"" It wasn't just that people were wanting to discuss with him the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Whitten says. They wanted to make sure he was genuinely OK. This was a first. ""Never in my lifetime of Black Lives Matter activism ever has that happened before."" He was OK, but he saw an opportunity to leverage this new-found concern from the white community to help those who weren't. On May 31, he posted on Facebook asking for donations from white allies to give cash to Black Portlanders who were struggling. The first day he raised $11,000, the next day $55,000. On the third day he raised more than $155,000. The Black Resilience Fund was born. In less than a year the organization raised more than $2 million in donations from corporations, foundations, government and thousands of individuals. Co-founder Salomé Chimuku joined the project as it got off the ground in those first few weeks. When Whitten told her about the project she had a hunch it was going to take off. ""I was like this is gonna be a lot bigger and take a lot more work than you think,"" she says. ""I became the systems person."" With a background in community engagement, Chimuku worked to quickly build internal structures of accountability and process. Needing infrastructure, they legally folded the Black Resilience Fund into another Portland-based nonprofit Whitten had already established: Brown Hope. They found an office, hired staff and solicited volunteers, of which there were many. Trapped at home during quarantine and watching the Portland protests, people were eager to help. At one point Chimuku oversaw a team of 400 people a day who had joined the effort. Elected officials including both of Oregon's U.S. senators endorsed the project. Researchers from Princeton studied them and wrote a report on them. Through all this work, they've helped more than 7,000 Black Portlanders through payments of a few hundred dollars. One recipient, Trayla Lomax, found herself living out of her car with her three young children after an eviction. ""It was devastating,"" Lomax says. ""It was really, really hard just getting them used to living here and there, having to go shower at peoples' houses."" Historic forest fires were raging across Oregon last summer and Lomax was at times dodging evacuation zones, when a friend told her about a guy named Cameron Whitten who was helping out people like her. She completed an online application and brief screening process in which she asked for money to put a security deposit on an apartment. Lomax says the process of receiving aid from the Black Resilience Fund was a compassionate one. ""It's so hard for me to ask for help sometimes,"" she says. ""It didn't make me feel 'less than.'"" Whitten understands first-hand the necessity of trusting recipients. He landed in Portland in 2009 after fleeing an abusive father and hitching a ride with two friends from the Virginia suburb where he grew up — a Black, queer kid with no place to go. He spent years crashing on couches and living in shelters, but eventually worked his way through college and took jobs in government and the nonprofit sector. Now that he's in the position of helping others, he's determined to make the process of getting aid less dehumanizing than what he experienced. For that reason, the organization is committed to a minimal screening process, without requiring extensive paperwork or proof of income in the form of paystubs, eviction papers or bank statements. Black Portlanders, says Whitten, have long been in crisis. ""Black folks have always needed a real economic jumpstart, like a stimulus package, in order for there to be parity with our racial wealth gap,"" Whitten says. That wealth gap is laid bare in the kinds of things recipients report using the money for: food, rent and power bills. There are also many unique stories: The woman who needed to fly home for her sister's funeral, the mom who needed equipment to homeschool her child with autism. More recently, donations have waned and the Black Resilience Fund has struggled to keep up with requests for help. But the founders are planning a new fundraising effort around the one-year anniversary of George Floyd's death."
npr|"The Facebook message instantly struck Andrew as suspicious. The note was from a stranger in Virginia named Cody who claimed to be a distant relative based on the uncommon last name they share. NPR is withholding it for security reasons. Cody's profile picture showed a burly masked man in militia-style get-up with a semiautomatic rifle slung across his chest. ""Um. Yeah. I was concerned,"" recalled Andrew, a 31-year-old music producer in Los Angeles. ""That's probably the nicest way I could say it."" Andrew figured it was an identity-theft scam. Or, because the note had arrived during last summer's racial justice protests, maybe a right-wing infiltration attempt related to his work as an organizer with Black Lives Matter groups. ""I was very hesitant, obviously,"" he said. ""But I also was intrigued. I've never met another person with my last name that I didn't have a direct relationship to."" Andrew warily accepted Cody's offer to trace his genealogy. Cody returned with records showing that they were eighth cousins; the research checked out with Andrew's own. ""Once he got all the way back to the 1700s,"" Andrew said, he was convinced that Cody was legit. He wanted to learn more. But there was still that unsettling profile pic with the body armor. The AR-15. ""I was like, 'This guy's a Proud Boy,' "" Andrew said. ""And we're related."" Cody, 24, is not part of the violent Proud Boys, but he does belong to a different segment of right-wing extremism. About two years ago, he joined a small Virginia-based gun group that's aligned with the Three Percenters, a cornerstone of the anti-government militia movement. Two members — not Cody — were at the Jan. 6 rally at the U.S. Capitol. When the two saw it descend into violence, Cody said, ""they booked it,"" and didn't join the mob. ""You gotta be kidding me. Some dude with horns on his head running around?"" Cody said, mocking the rioters. ""It was ridiculous."" In Andrew, Cody couldn't have stumbled upon a more different relative if he'd tried. At demonstrations against police violence, Andrew wears the black bloc uniform of militant leftists, along with a gas mask and a helmet inscribed with ""Black Lives Matter."" He's an organizer, ""a white ally,"" with Black-led activist groups fighting for reparations and the abolition of policing systems. With a laugh, Andrew described his politics as ""about as far left as you can get."" Andrew and Cody sit on opposite coasts and opposite sides of the political spectrum, each representing movements accused by the other of fueling domestic terrorism. It's unlikely they ever would've met, much less struck up a dialogue, were it not for their chance connection through a German settler who lived two centuries ago. In separate interviews with NPR, the cousins said they recognize that their bond runs counter to national trends of deep polarization and mistrust. At the same time, they're careful not to present what Andrew called ""a buddy-buddy, antifa-Three Percenter love story."" Their talks are deep and respectful, they said, but the differences are real. ""He knows what I do. I know what he does,"" Cody said. ""He'll talk to me about his reparations march, and I'll talk to him about, you know, the gun lobby."" According to the FBI, the extreme right is the deadliest and most active threat in the U.S.; far-left violence is much less frequent and seldom fatal. Still, no matter how lopsided the picture, the ""both sides"" framing persists. Millions of Americans believe the threats are equivalent, thanks in large part to the former Trump administration and conservative media outlets exaggerating the risk of the ""radical left."" Now, there's a barbed question at the heart of the Biden administration's pledge to fight violent extremism: Who's an extremist? And as federal authorities insist they police criminal action, not ideology, there's renewed debate over how and when extremists should be monitored. Does Cody's militia affiliation make him a national security risk even if he doesn't violate any laws? Should authorities track militant leftists like Andrew? As they began their correspondence, Andrew clicked through Cody's Facebook photos and was relieved to see that gun rights seemed to be his focus. There were no MAGA hats or racist posts, he recalled. The cousins latched onto common interests, such as music. Cody plays the banjo; Andrew produces hip-hop and K-pop. They also traded family lore about moonshiners and war deserters. Eventually, gingerly, they broached the harder parts of their history, the parts that linger in modern-day unrest. They wrestled with the discovery of Confederate relatives. Another was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. But stretching back even earlier, Cody said, their first ancestors on U.S. soil were German Baptists whose sect ardently opposed slavery. The cousins' dialogue has since expanded to today's thorny issues of race and identity and to the type of nation each of them envisions. Like many Americans, Andrew and Cody are struggling with the pain of estrangement from close family members who disagree with their politics. The Capitol riot illuminated the uncomfortable what-ifs of their own relationship. They've each privately wondered whether divisions would get so bad that one day they'd be on opposite sides of an armed conflict, like their ancestors in the Civil War. ""Through Cody, I've learned more about my family history than any other person,"" Andrew said. ""And the more I learn about it, the more I feel like it kind of ties back into what's going on right now. Family and history Deep in the Blue Ridge Mountains one recent afternoon, Cody knelt at the grave of a long-dead relative, smoothing the earth for a new headstone. He then pressed the granite slab into place, restoring a name to a great-great-aunt's unmarked grave. ""That's one of my big fears — is to be forgotten,"" Cody said. ""To be laid up here somewhere and then just forgotten, like nothing you ever did in your whole life mattered anymore."" Family and history are woven into his favorite hobbies. Genealogy quests take him along winding mountain roads to cemeteries where some old graves are still adorned with colorful memory jugs, an Appalachian tradition. Cody's relatives have played bluegrass music for generations, another legacy he has kept alive by learning the dulcimer, mandolin and fiddle. And then there's the militia. Cody said his forebears survived war and hardship because they were resourceful. Today, he said, wider unrest seems inevitable given the recent turmoil, and he wants to be similarly prepared. ""I've always been taught: Hope for the best, expect the worst,"" he said. For Cody, that starts with self-defense, a right he considers absolute. He dismissed all gun control laws as ""infringements."" Nicknamed ""Sasquatch"" for his shaggy hair and linebacker build, Cody married his high school sweetheart a year ago. He said he only reluctantly voted for Donald Trump and despises white supremacists. A self-described libertarian, Cody advocates universal health care, believes systemic racism must be dismantled and supports marijuana legalization, marriage equality and abortion rights. Cody sounds like a Bernie bro — until it comes to guns. In the nation's political tribalism, the Second Amendment is claimed by the right, so that's where Cody drifted. His interest in gun rights led him to right-wing online forums, which in turn piqued his interest in organized Second Amendment groups. Militia groups. ""Everyone was so reclusive,"" Cody said of his attempts to make contact. ""You had to be a vetted member and all that stuff before they even talked to you."" Eventually, Cody joined a small, southeastern Virginia faction that focuses on self-defense and prepping. He said the group rejects white supremacist ideology and includes Black and Puerto Rican members. Cody says the idea is to be prepared for civil unrest, not to provoke it. ""Even if the FBI planted somebody in our group, you're going to find a bunch of fat dudes running around in the woods,"" he said. ""You're not going to find any crime."" When NPR first met Cody at a gun rally in January, he was dressed as he was in the Facebook pic that alarmed his cousin Andrew: tactical gear, plus the AR-15 loaded with armor-piercing rounds. He stood on a street corner by the statehouse in Richmond with other members of his militia group, outnumbered by journalists who'd come to see ""the far-right threat"" up close. Nearby, a few ""boogaloo"" extremists whom Cody is friendly with were yelling into a bullhorn about armed rebellion against the government. They posed with their rifles under signs saying that weapons were banned in the area by local ordinance. That was Jan. 18, not two weeks after the storming of the U.S. Capitol. Throngs of police watched closely but made no move against them. The scene outside the Virginia statehouse encapsulated a long-standing laissez-faire approach by authorities toward predominantly white paramilitaries. So-called patriot groups have been allowed to build armed movements whose stated goal is the eventual overthrow of the ""tyrannical government."" Despite high-profile standoffs with the federal government, they've operated as if they're untouchable — their rhetoric protected by the First Amendment, their arsenals by the Second. The Capitol attack, however, could be a game-changer. Outrage over the deadly breach is turning into demands for ""war on terror""-style tactics to combat the violent right. So far, more than 320 people face federal charges in the Capitol siege; semi-organized factions such as the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers were slapped with conspiracy cases. Right-wing groups that once were comfortable are beginning to find themselves in the crosshairs. Even Cody's tiny startup militia has lost its Facebook page twice. Last month, Cody personally felt the squeeze. He said someone alerted his employer to his Facebook photos, the ones of him in body armor, including one where his work badge was visible. He said company security guards searched his desk and grilled him about his whereabouts on Jan. 6. He went along with it, Cody said, because he had nothing to hide, but he warned that such moves would backfire. ""We can train and be as scary looking as they want,"" Cody said. ""The moment they start investigating us and sending people to our houses, then they're picking the fight."" Incensed over the trouble at work, Cody said, he decided to post more Facebook pictures. Again, they showed him wearing tactical gear and carrying his rifle. This time, the caption read: ""To my secret admirers, you know who you are."" He ended the post with a kissy-face emoji. A political transformation On a phone call from Los Angeles, Andrew began the tale of his long-lost cousin who happens to be in a right-wing militia by acknowledging that everything about it is bizarre, including the backdrop. ""It's kind of a very random story that probably could've only happened during quarantine,"" he said. That first message from Cody arrived while Andrew was in lockdown, with more time than usual to go down a genealogical rabbit hole. As their correspondence deepened, he spent weeks learning about his ancestry, as well as about Cody's world of guns and doomsday preppers. Andrew said it make him think about his own evolution, from growing up in a conservative Republican household in Florida to getting pepper-sprayed by cops on the streets of Los Angeles. ""I would've been one of those Proud Boy, Trump people when I was 18,"" Andrew said. ""But it was through my friends that didn't just throw me to the curb and said, 'Hey, no, I think you're wrong. Let's talk about this. I challenge that idea. Tell me why you think you're right,' and actually having these back-and-forths, I was able to grow."" Andrew said his transformation began at a family reunion in the hills of West Virginia. He'd grown up with his father telling him stories about their Appalachian heritage, but Andrew hadn't visited in person. When he did, Andrew said, he found that his paternal relatives were ""the sweetest people."" Until it came time for after-dinner conversation. ""After we had gotten done eating our big family dinner, I heard them referring to Black people as the N-word,"" Andrew said. ""And this is only in 2010 or so."" He recalled looking around the room, waiting for an adult to object. No one did. That moment, he said, set him down an activist path. ""There's 90 people at this family reunion,"" Andrew said. ""How many other American families does that represent?"" Andrew said his politics quickly moved from conservative to libertarian, then from liberal to leftist. By 2011, he said, he was participating in Occupy-era protests, his first experience with serious organizing. Fast-forward to 2021, and Andrew's Instagram feed, a showcase for his latest music, also shows him in full street-battle gear with his fist in the air or with fellow activists chanting, ""F*** the police!"" at protests. His comments are laced with references to ""direct action,"" a more confrontational activism in response to police violence or threats from right-wing vigilantes. ""NOW is the time to get out and FIGHT against systemic racism and police brutality!"" Andrew wrote in one caption. As it turns out, the Second Amendment is an area of agreement for Andrew and Cody. While Andrew doesn't share his cousin's zero-restrictions stance, he does support gun ownership, especially as protection for Black and other communities of color. ""When you see how these white mobs are able to get away with what they do, I think one of the biggest common factors is that they're all armed,"" he said. Andrew said he was also pleased to hear Cody thinking seriously about reparations, a key plank in Andrew's activism. They've spent long calls talking about the immeasurable pain and loss caused by slavery. They said the eradication of Black history comes into sharp relief against their own easy connection through family records dating back centuries. Andrew told Cody about a reparations march he was helping to organize in Washington, D.C. It was scheduled for Jan. 21, the day after the presidential inauguration. The goal was to force attention to the issue on the Biden administration's first full day in office. ""We'd been in the process for months and months of planning this event,"" Andrew said. ""Had tickets booked, Airbnb booked and everything."" Then he heard from Cody in Virginia. Cody was watching his right-wing circles rev up for a big pro-Trump rally on Jan. 6. He told Andrew the mood was tense, angry. This one, he warned, could be big. ""I'm getting messages from Cody, like, 'Yo, man, you shouldn't go to the Capitol. I'm just looking out for you. I want to make sure my cousin is safe,' "" Andrew said. On Jan. 6, Andrew watched the rioters on TV and saw the dream of a reparations march evaporate. He was on the phone with other activists, discussing logistics and security concerns and ""trying to decipher what was going on."" ""Are these people going to leave? Are they going to stay? Are they going to take over the country? It was one of the most chaotic times of my life,"" Andrew said. ""It changed everything overnight. We had people saying there's no way in hell we can do this march."" Once the initial shock wore off, Andrew said, he thought again about Cody's warning from ""the other side."" He thought about where the country is heading, where it has been. ""It made me really think about the Civil War in terms of, yeah, there were families fighting against each other,"" Andrew said. ""Brothers, sisters, cousins, you know. And I'd learned that in history, but it never really clicked with me what that was like."" ""We've got to live in the same country"" After the storming of the Capitol, the area became a ringed-off fortress patrolled by the National Guard. With calm restored, the reparations march eventually received new permits for a new date: Feb. 14, Valentine's Day. Andrew flew to D.C. from L.A. with several Black activists. Cody drove three hours from Virginia to meet his cousin in person for the first time. On the morning of the march, Cody showed up to the Lincoln Memorial, a big white guy in jeans and work boots looking a bit lost among the Black activists chanting reparations slogans or posing for photos with their fists raised. A DJ played go-go music. Volunteers arranged pamphlets and buttons at booths. Cody scanned the crowd until he spotted a white organizer dressed in a leather jacket with ""Black Lives Matter"" scrawled across the back. It was Andrew. The cousins greeted each other with COVID-19-era elbow bumps, their smiles showing behind their masks. ""Nice to meet you, cuz!"" ""You too!"" There was no awkwardness. Within minutes, Cody was helping Andrew set out folding chairs. Andrew introduced him to Tara Perry, a Black activist and lead reparations organizer, explaining that Cody was a ""cousin I just met five seconds ago."" ""Hi, Cody. Welcome!"" Perry said. ""Howdy,"" Cody replied. This was not the reception Cody had envisioned. He admitted that he'd imagined ""some Black Panther dudes in the hats"" confronting him and asking what he was doing there. He laughed when asked whether his militia buddies would ever attend an event like this. ""If they were here, they would be here for me, and they would probably all be armed and keep their eyes about them,"" Cody said. ""Just because of the stereotypes about Black Lives Matter."" Andrew said he knows that some people in his own activist circles wouldn't approve of his bond with Cody. To many, he said, a militia is a militia is a militia. And the label is often used interchangeably with ""white supremacist"" or ""domestic terrorist."" Talking about nuances on the right isn't exactly popular, and it became even less so after Jan. 6. Andrew quickly added, as a disclaimer, that he wasn't advocating giving platforms to dangerous racists. He has no problem slapping a ""domestic terrorism"" label on violent hate groups. But he said he's uncomfortable with broad-brush portrayals of everyone on the right as irredeemable hatemongers. That's not how Andrew sees Cody. ""I know Cody, but everyone else is going to look at him and see him the same as every Proud Boy, boogaloo, Three Percenter militia person,"" Andrew said. ""But I think it's worth pursuing at least some sense of commonality because we've got to live in the same country as a lot of other people we disagree with."" Besides, Andrew noted, only a few months ago, his side was the one the White House portrayed as enemy No. 1. ""Like Black Lives Matter, the whole summer it's been, 'Oh, this is chaos in the streets,' and Trump saying, 'We need to hit these animals hard' and stuff like that — really incendiary language being used against us,"" Andrew said. ""We've got to be careful because all it takes is the next person in power feeling like you're a terrorist and then all of a sudden you're in that group."" It was still early. Marchers weren't expected for at least another hour, so Andrew and Cody walked down to the monument's famous reflecting pool. They had a lot to talk about. Senior producer Walter Ray Watson contributed editing and sound design to this report."
npr|In the fight against violent extremism, there's a hot debate: Who's an extremist? Two cousins, one a far-right militia member and the other aligned with Antifa, bring that debate to life.
npr|"A Georgia sheriff's office is reopening an investigation into the 2013 death of Kendrick Johnson, a Black teenager whose body was found inside a rolled-up gym mat in his high school gymnasium. Lowndes County Sheriff Ashley Paulk, who was retired at the time of Johnson's death, confirmed to NPR that his office officially reopened the investigation on Friday. It did so after receiving documents it had long requested from a Justice Department investigation that closed in 2016. ""I'm not accusing anybody of anything, but I want to start fresh with it and look at it all the way through,"" Paulk told Atlanta NBC affiliate WXIA on Monday. "" I think the community deserves it."" Questions, investigations and lawsuits have abounded in the years since Johnson's body was discovered at Lowndes High School in Valdosta, Ga., in January 2013. The 17-year-old disappeared one afternoon and was found the next morning with his head facing down inside an upright rolled-up gym mat and his feet sticking out of the top. State authorities ruled his death an accident in 2013, suggesting he dove into the mat to retrieve a shoe and got trapped inside, after an autopsy found that he died of ""positional asphyxia."" The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office closed the case, but Johnson's family still suspected foul play. A second autopsy, done at the family's request, determined the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the right side of Johnson's neck and the ""manner of death was not an accident,"" according to federal investigators. In October 2013, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Georgia announced a federal criminal civil rights investigation into Johnson's death. Officials interviewed nearly 100 people, scoured tens of thousands of emails and texts, reviewed surveillance videos from the high school and consulted with independent medical examiners. The Justice Department closed the case in June 2016, saying it could not meet the high legal threshold needed to file federal criminal charges — it would have needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that someone had killed Johnson, and was motivated by racial animus to do so. ""We regret that we were unable to provide Johnson's family and friends with more definitive answers about Kendrick's tragic death,"" Acting United States Attorney Carole Rendon said at the time. Assembling the case records for a new investigation Paulk, who served as sheriff for 16 years before retiring in 2012 and returning to win reelection in 2016, told NPR the Johnson case has been ""very divisive for a long time,"" with questions still swirling in the community. Upon returning to office, he said, he had pledged that if he could get all the files from state and federal agencies, he would go through them and look for discrepancies. Paulk had been trying to obtain those federal investigation documents since April 2019. His initial request was denied, but the Johnson family continued their pursuit. They did so through Marcus Coleman, a community activist who has served as their family spokesperson for the last eight years. In a phone interview with NPR, Coleman said his renewed push to gain justice for Johnson started in October, on the heels of the country's reckoning over racial injustice and police brutality following the high-profile killings of Black people including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. ""As I engaged in community activities myself here and across the country, it just never sat well with me the way that Kendrick Johnson's case was closed,"" Coleman said. ""And the uprising — as I like to call it — this summer just gave me the energy to pursue reopening this case."" Coleman said he initially sought the release of 2015 grand jury proceedings, after Kentucky's attorney general did so in Breonna Taylor's case. That journey took him first to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Georgia, which he learned had recused itself from the case, then to that of the Northern District of Ohio, where it had been transferred. Coleman said he and Johnson's parents eventually met with the then-U.S. attorney in Cleveland in November, and asked to have the case reopened. He said the process appeared to be underway, albeit slowed by the holiday season and the pandemic. Last month the sheriff's office received what Paulk described as 17 ""filing cabinet boxes"" of evidence including documents and hard drives. Coleman said he and Johnson's family felt the number of boxes was symbolic, as it matches the years of Johnson's short life. Paulk met with the family on March 5 to tell them he had formally reopened the investigation. ""When the news came down, I can say that, in one breath, they're grateful, they're thankful for the reopening,"" Coleman said. ""But in that same breath, 'cautiously optimistic' probably would be the most accurate label. And I mean it's just rightfully so considering all of the letdowns that they've had over the years."" ""This is a case we have to look at."" Coleman said the Johnsons believe their son was struck with an object ""which was ultimately the start of his demise,"" and want his death certificate listed as blunt force trauma rather than asphyxiation. He said they believe many of the answers to their questions — such as about the state of his body when it was discovered — are contained in those 17 boxes. Paulk said he will personally lead the reopened investigation, which will include some officials who worked on it the first time as well as some new to it. He plans to re-interview some individuals and talk to new people, and has already conducted one interview this week, Paulk told WXIA. He clarified that the 17 boxes contain evidence pertaining to the federal investigation, and that his office already had access to the materials from the state's earlier investigation. Paulk noted that he was born and raised in Valdosta, and has known the Johnson family for decades, but emphasized that his office is ""not starting out with it's a murder it's an accident. We're starting out with this is a case we have to look at."" Paulk said the process will take at least six months, as there is a lot of material to parse. He reiterated he is not accusing anyone of wrongdoing, but wants to examine all the evidence together to make sure nothing was missed. ""This will be the first time anybody's had everybody's evidence in one place, so I'm planning to go through every bit of it,"" Paulk said. ""If we find a contradiction we're going to resolve any contradiction, or try to."""
npr|"A Des Moines Register reporter has been found not guilty by an Iowa jury of failing to disperse and interfering with official acts. She was arrested by police last summer as she was covering a Black Lives Matter protest last summer. Andrea Sahouri's case has drawn international concerns over its implications for press freedom amid what First Amendment advocates have said is a sharp increase in recent arrests of journalists in the U.S. Sahouri, 25, was arrested on May 31 during a protest that took place days after George Floyd's killing in Minneapolis. She said that a police officer, identified as Luke Wilson, deliberately pepper-sprayed her and zip-tied her wrists even after she identified herself as a journalist. If she had been found guilty, Sahouri's misdemeanor charges could have resulted in fines and up to 30 days in jail. Taking the stand on Tuesday, the second day of the trial, Sahouri told the six-person jury that her actions were professional and that she announced to the arresting officer that she was a journalist. ""I wasn't doing anything wrong,"" Sahouri said, as Iowa Public Radio reported. ""I said, 'I'm press, I'm press, I'm press.' He grabbed me, pepper-sprayed me and as he was doing so said, 'That's not what I asked.' "" Police body cam video that was shown to the jury supported Sahouri's version of events, showing that as she dealt with the effects of the pepper spray, she told the officer: ""This is my job ... I'm just doing my job. I'm a journalist."" Sahouri said she was running away from police in riot gear who fired tear gas into the crowd as they moved to disperse protesters near a Des Moines shopping mall. When she saw Wilson coming toward her, she said, she put up her hands. Sahouri's then-boyfriend, Spenser Robnett, was also arrested and charged. The jury also found him not guilty. Another Register reporter, Katie Akin, was also at the protest. Robnett, who also took the stand on Tuesday, said that after Sahouri was pepper-sprayed, he told Wilson that Sahouri was a reporter. The officer then pepper-sprayed Robnett, who was knocked to the ground, he said. Akin, who testified that she yelled that both she and Sahouri were journalists and showed her press credentials, said that she was surprised when Sahouri was arrested because ""I didn't understand us to be breaking any laws."" The Register's executive editor, Carol Hunter, has acknowledged that Sahouri was not wearing a press badge, which she said had been left in the reporter's car, The Associated Press reports. Hunter called it a ""red herring,"" saying the police knew she was a journalist. Wilson, who has served on the force in Des Moines for 18 years, testified that he found a ""riotous mob"" when he responded to the scene of the protest. He said that his unit was ordered to clear a parking lot and blanketed the area with pepper spray. Wilson told the jury that he decided to arrest Sahouri when she didn't leave the area. He said he was not aware that she was a journalist at the time of her arrest. He said he pepper-sprayed Robnett after he tried to remove the officer's arm from Sahouri, according to the AP. On cross-examination by Sahouri's attorney, Wilson said he charged her with interference because she briefly pulled her left arm away while he was arresting her, the AP said. He acknowledged that his police report doesn't mention that accusation. The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker said 128 journalists were arrested or detained in the U.S. last year – the vast majority at protests — compared with just nine in 2019. Besides Sahouri, 13 other journalists currently face criminal charges, it added. In a statement ahead of this week's trial, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press said that ""the decision to move forward with Sahouri's prosecution flies in the face of the First Amendment."" ""Law enforcement should never have arrested Andrea Sahouri in the first place simply for doing her job as a reporter,"" the group's executive director, Bruce Brown, said. ""Andrea and other journalists like her played an essential role in informing their communities about the protests for racial justice and police accountability that took place last year, and how law enforcement responded to those demonstrations."""
npr|"An Iowa newspaper reporter arrested as she covered a Black Lives Matter protest last spring goes on trial Monday in a case that has drawn international concern over press freedom. The Des Moines Register reporter, Andrea Sahouri, was arrested on May 31 as protesters clashed with police during a demonstration near a shopping mall in the Iowa capital. Sahouri's then-boyfriend, Spenser Robnett, accompanied her for ""safety reasons,"" the Register says. Despite repeatedly identifying herself as ""press,"" police deliberately pepper sprayed her and then zip-tied her for arrest, she said. Sahouri and Robnett were later charged with failure to disperse and interfering with official acts, misdemeanors that could carry fines and up to 30 days in jail. In video taken by local television station KCCI, a masked Sahouri and another person, presumably Robnett, are shown seated on the pavement in front of a storefront with their hands secured behind their backs. Shortly after her arrest, Sahouri posted a video of her own, posted to Twitter from inside a police vehicle. In it, she recounts the incident, saying she was ""just reporting"" when she was taken into custody. In the video, she says Robnett was hit by a teargas canister. ""As I was seeing if his leg was O.K., police came closer and we went around the corner and I was saying, 'I'm press. I'm press. I'm press,'"" Sahouri said. Des Moines police and John Sarcone, the attorney for Polk County, contend that at the time of her arrest, Sahouri wasn't wearing any media credentials and appeared to be participating in an unlawful assembly. Police had issued an order to disperse about 90 minutes before, according to the Register. The Associated Press reports that the newspaper's executive editor, Carol Hunter, has acknowledged that Sahouri was not wearing a press badge, which she said had been left in the reporter's car. Hunter called it a ""red herring,"" saying the police immediately knew Sahouri is a journalist and that carrying press credentials is not necessary to enjoy Constitutional protections. ""Freedom of the press rests on newsgathering,"" Hunter said, according to the AP. ""This really is an attack on a fundamental part of being able to bring people the news."" On Friday, prosecutor Bradley Kinkade argued at a pretrial hearing that Sahouri being a journalist ""is irrelevant to her charges."" ""This is a standard misdemeanor trial,"" he told the court, as the Register reported. However, the Iowa Freedom of Information Council said that ""All Iowans should be troubled by this abuse of prosecutorial discretion."" ""The Founding Fathers wrote the First Amendment for this very purpose — to allow the media to scrutinize the actions of law officers,"" the Council said in a statement. Amnesty International has also weighed in on Sahouri's case, saying that ""treating media work as a crime is a human rights violation."" In a statement sent to NPR, Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, said the charges against Sahouri ""represent a clear violation of press freedom and fit a disturbing pattern of abuses against journalists by police in the USA."" ""It's deeply troubling that the prosecutor would push these bogus charges all the way to trial,"" Guevara-Rosas said. The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker reports that 127 journalists were arrested in 2020 – the vast majority at protests. That compares to just nine such arrests the previous year. It says Sahouri is among 13 journalists who currently face criminal charges. The Register reports that at the start of the trial on Monday, the judge rejected a motion to dismiss the charges against Sahouri and that jury selection was underway. Prosecutors may try to bring up text messages they obtained that were exchanged between Sahouri and a protest leader, Matè Muhammad, about a week after her arrest. Muhammad — who has been charged with shining a laser pointer in the eyes of police during an August BLM protest — says he and Sahouri struck up a professional relationship following her arrest. He was quoted by the AP as saying, ""We enjoy working with her not because we view her as an activist or on our side, but because we view her as fair."""
politico|"This is the year Black Lives Matter grew from a grassroots, ad-hoc agitator to a potential political powerhouse. And with Joe Biden as president-elect, its leaders are seeking to expand their influence beyond the streets — and into the corridors of Washington. The summer of protests against racial injustice and police violence brought millions to the streets under the banner of Black Lives Matter. It also gave the international movement significant corporate and political muscle, which leaders used to launch a nationwide voter mobilization effort, registering and turning out millions of first-time voters. Armed with an infusion of cash, they launched a political action committee in October — a move that signals their readiness to deal in the mainstream political arena. Next on their agenda: Barnstorming Georgia to get out the vote for the Senate runoffs on Jan. 5. The control of the Senate is on the line and with it, any hopes for the sweeping reforms of the Black Lives Matter political agenda. ""The ballot is actually an essential tool to our movement,"" Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors said in an interview. ""We are both marching and protesting. And we are going to the voting booth. Those are multiple tools in our toolbox to change our system."" But changing the system won""t be easy. As an organization, Black Lives Matter deliberately eschews a central leadership infrastructure, which makes forming consensus around their policy goals more complicated. It doesn""t help, either, that there is growing animosity among Democrats toward the movement. Many blame calls to defund the police — one of activists"" central talking points — for their down ballot losses. Meanwhile, Black Lives Matter leaders argue Democrats aren""t pushing hard enough with criminal justice reform, coronavirus relief and a major police funding overhaul. ""Black Lives Matter, through media and social media, can organize marches all across the world,"" said Illinois Rep. Bobby Rush, a former Black Panther. ""However, can Black Lives Matter get a bill passed in the House of Representatives? No, I don""t think so."" The BREATHE Act is one example of this dynamic in play. In July, leaders with the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of more than 50 social justice organizations affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement, unveiled the four-part legislative proposal, which calls for mitigating police violence through divestment from law enforcement and investment in communities of color. The proposal was backed by Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), but efforts to get it on the DNC platform in August failed. It remains atop the movement""s list of legislative priorities. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, drafted in response to the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, represents Democrats"" efforts to meet protesters"" demands halfway. The bipartisan bill, introduced by Congressional Black Caucus chair Karen Bass (D-Calif.), would end qualified immunity in civil rights suits against police, form national standards for officers' use of force and establish a database to track officer offenses. It passed the House in June and is unlikely to pass the Senate, which drafted its own unsuccessful version. Jessica Byrd, a political strategist and lead organizer with the Movement for Black Lives, said the bill is a positive sign but ""not enough,"" because it does not address police budgets or the harm wrought on overpoliced communities, which tend to be communities of color. ""The idea that you need to make murder illegal when murder is already illegal, is ridiculous,"" Byrd said. ""We aren't going to take our eyes off of that. And we're not going to allow people to tinker around the edges and tell us that it's progress."" In the weeks leading up to Election Day, lead organizers with the Movement for Black Lives strategized how they would respond to its outcome. If Joe Biden lost, leaders and strategists said, they planned to focus on local races, fighting to elect reform-minded mayors, city and county commissioners. If he won, they would spend the first 100 days of his administration urging him to enact reforms that millions of protesters had been calling for in the streets. Hours after the presidential race was called, Cullors sent Biden and Kamala Harris a letter requesting a meeting. In it, Cullors made it clear that she and movement leaders intended to hold their administration accountable to their demands. ""We want to be heard and our agenda to be prioritized,"" Cullors wrote. ""We issue these expectations not just because Black people are the most consistent and reliable voters for Democrats, but also because Black people are truly living in crisis in a nation that was built on our subjugation."" Leaders with the Movement for Black Lives say they plan to push the Biden-Harris administration to immediately end cash bail and grant amnesty to protesters targeted by the National Guard under President Trump. Any stimulus bill Congress passes, they argue, should specifically provide relief to the Black, Latino and Native communities disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus. In the meantime, Cullors said she""s yet to hear back from Biden or Harris. Tlaib, who supports Black Lives Matter, said she is optimistic about the chances of police reform passing under a Biden administration. The Black Lives Matter movement will not let up on pressuring a Biden administration, she said. ""Growing up in Detroit and one of the most beautiful blackest cities in the country, one thing it taught me is that transformative change happens when we organize in the streets and it reaches Congress and it reaches the White House,"" said Tlaib. ""I'm an extension of that movement work."" This year, the movement helped secure a number of electoral wins, which, its leaders say, proves their political value to the Democratic Party. The height of the Black Lives Matter protests over the summer brought a surge in Democratic voter registrations by about 2 million, according to an analysis by TargetSmart. In addition to galvanizing record turnout in predominantly Black cities like Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Detroit, organizers in Georgia helped register more than 800,000 new voters to help deliver the state for Biden. In January, they""ll be sending one of their own to Congress. Cori Bush, a nurse from Ferguson, Mo., will be the first Black Lives Matter activist elected to national office. Two other progressive candidates heading for Washington, Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) and Ritchie Torres (D-NY), are progressive allies of the movement. What""s more, nearly a dozen major cities also elected progressive district attorneys, including Los Angeles, where incumbent Jackie Lacey was unseated by George Gascón, who ran on a platform promising to stop trying juveniles as adults and end the death penalty. In St. Louis, Kim Gardner, a circuit attorney who was among those who ran with the backing of the Black Lives Matter movement, said that protests in the city in the wake of the police killings of Floyd and Taylor ""energized voters to vote and understand that these local prosecutor elections are important."" ""It reaffirmed the accountability of local prosecutors as well as the activist community to make sure they hold electeds accountable for what we know needs to be reformed,"" Gardner said, citing police accountability as one of the top issues she""s vowed to address. Any chance for Democrats to pass sweeping reforms, however, hinges largely on their control of the Senate, which is why Black Lives Matter activists are planning to travel to Georgia in the coming weeks. Democrats face considerable odds in flipping both Senate seats blue. That won""t stop their lobbying, said Maurice Mitchell, director of the Working Families Party, during a press call last week. ""Clearly, if Mitch McConnell is in control of the Senate, we anticipate that there will be some obstruction there,"" Mitchell said. ""But we're going to — on the local, state and federal level — continue to push our demands, and then call on Biden to do the things that the president could do even without the ability to pull on the levers of the legislature."" Biden has recognized the role that Black voters played in his election and promised to return the favor in his presidential victory speech. His ""Lift Every Voice"" plan for Black America aims to address racial disparities in health, the economy, education and criminal justice. His approach to police reform involves reinvestment in the COPS program, which calls for police departments to hire officers that reflect the racial diversity of their communities — a stark contrast from the invest-divest framework activists have been calling for. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Still, experts maintain that Black Lives Matter has already made significant inroads even if they are not immediately noticeable. In the long run, some argue, any legislation passed may very likely have its roots in the movement work completed this year. ""Biden and Harris can advocate for major reforms of policing while still appearing moderate by saying they oppose defunding the police,"" said Omar Wasow, an assistant professor of politics at Princeton University. ""For some more militant activists, this might seem like a failure. But if Biden and Harris have been pulled further towards more significant reforms by the Black Lives Matter protests, then the activism made an important difference."" Yet, there are still concerns that the movement""s gains could diminish even after the summer of protest, despite the bolstered national profile and increased support. Rush said he envisions a future in which Black Lives Matter, if it continues on its current trajectory, becomes ""its own political apparatus"" that will in turn make it ""more compromising in its goals and in its virtues."" ""It happens all the time in every social movement,"" Rush explained. ""Every social movement carries with it the seeds of its own disintegration or its own disempowerment … activists become less relevant as agents of change. That""s just the reality. They gotta go through that."" Still, Rush said, he feels that even as the movement""s influence waxes and wanes, he""s still optimistic about the progress made. ""You can stop a revolutionary but you can""t stop the revolution,"" Rush said, invoking the words of his late comrade Fred Hampton. ""Revolutionaries have a short lifespan. Revolutionary organizations have a short lifespan. Revolutions don""t."" Laura Barrón-López contributed to this report."
politico|"An intersection near the White House where federal law enforcement used chemical irritants and flash-bang grenades earlier this week to clear a peaceful demonstration against racial injustice has a new name: Black Lives Matter Plaza. The designation from the District of Columbia's government comes after more than a week of protests over the death of George Floyd, a black Minneapolis man who was killed in the custody of police last week. The protests have in some instances turned violent, including last weekend in the District of Columbia, where an alphabet soup of federal and local law enforcement and military forces were called in to quell bouts of unrest and restore order. Although more recent protests have remained mostly peaceful, the White House has grown increasingly fortified in recent days amid and effort to keep demonstrations away from the executive mansion. Protesters have nonetheless gathered near the White House every night this week in groups numbering in the thousands. The Trump administration has faced significant criticism this week for its decision to use aggressive tactics on Monday to clear Lafayette Park of apparently peaceful protesters so that the president could cross it on foot to visit a historic church where rioters had set a small fire the night before. Trump, holding a Bible, posed briefly for photographs with members of his administration before returning to the White House, a photo opportunity that was widely criticized by religious leaders and a bipartisan swath of lawmakers. On Friday, in addition to unveiling ""Black Lives Matter Plaza,"" honoring the national movement aimed at combating systemic racism and police killings of black Americans, the District also teamed up with local artists to adorn a stretch of 16th Street NW in front of the White House in giant yellow lettering bearing the group""s name. The D.C. chapter of the Black Lives Matter global network quickly rejected the plaza name and street painting as ""performative."" The group accused D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser of attempting to distract from ""her active counter organizing to our demands,"" which include a reduction of the city""s police budget and the reinvestment of those funds in other community priorities. While it""s not abnormal for the city to adopt new ceremonial names for streets around the District, such treatment is typically reserved for jabs at despotic foreign governments. In the most recent high-profile example, residents of D.C.""s Foggy Bottom and West End neighborhoods attempted to rename a stretch of roadway in front of the Saudi Embassy after Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist and critic of the Saudi royal family who was murdered in 2018 by Saudi operatives in the country""s Istanbul consulate. The effort hit a roadblock in the form of a D.C. law barring public spaces ""from being named in honor of any person who is alive or has been deceased for less than two years,"" according to WTOP. Earlier that year, the city designated the stretch of Wisconsin Avenue on which the Russian Embassy sits as ""Boris Nemtsov Plaza,"" in honor of a slain opposition leader. And several blocks up 16th Street from the newly unveiled ""Black Lives Matter Plaza"" sits ""Andrei Sakharov Plaza,"" an homage to one of the best-known dissidents of the Soviet Union in front of the former Soviet Embassy and the current home of the Russian ambassador. There have been similar efforts to rib foreign governments and honor dissidents with ceremonial street names in the nation""s capital. Then-President Barack Obama shut down an effort in 2016 to rename the street in front of the Chinese Embassy after an imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate. And in 2015, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) introduced legislation that would name the street in front of the newly reopened Cuban Embassy about two miles up 16th Street from the White House after a prominent opponent of Fidel Castro""s regime."
politico|"On the heels of nearly six months of nationwide demonstrations that sparked an international movement against systemic racism and police violence, Black Lives Matter is expanding its influence into politics by forming a political action committee -- a highly unusual move for a grassroots organizing group with no central leadership. The Black Lives Matter PAC will formally roll out its programs as early as Monday, according to Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter. The committee plans to endorse a slate of candidates ahead of the general election, paying special attention to mayoral, county sheriff and district attorney races. ""We want to be able to not just speak in ""get out the vote"" language,"" Cullors said in an interview with POLITICO. ""Black Lives Matter is launching our PAC so we can talk directly to voters about who we think that they should be voting for and what we think they should be voting on."" The PAC""s formation is the latest in a wave of political efforts from social justice organizations ahead of the November election. In late September the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of more than 50 organizing groups nationwide, launched The Frontline initiative to turn out the vote among young people of color. Black Lives Matter has also spearheaded four separate projects aiming to encourage young Black voters to head to the polls, including a multi-million-dollar outreach campaign and anti-disinformation initiative. Movement leaders, too, are laying the groundwork for a national policy overhaul that meets the demands for change born out of the summer of protests. On Thursday the Working Families Party announced its 2021 legislative proposal in partnership with Black Lives Matter leaders and progressive organizing groups. The platform has the support of several progressive lawmakers, including Reps. Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Cullors said that Black Lives Matter""s political action committee gives the movement an opportunity to hold elected officials accountable on their turf. The group will continue to push for policy change, Cullors said, and now, with the PAC, the organization can wield greater influence from the inside. She said Stacey Abrams' 2018 Georgia gubernatorial loss is one example of why movement work is an important component of electoral politics. The goal of the PAC is to put more candidates who align with Black Lives Matter's goals in office. ""We see this as something that we are going to be pushing for during other elections. We have this national election now but we will have midterm elections,"" she said. ""It""s a long time in the making and this is the right time to launch it."""
politico|"Since George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer in late May, Black Lives Matter activists have taken to the streets demanding radical changes to police departments and other parts of government. So far, the political class is offering little more than words painted on streets. That, at least, is the emerging sentiment toward the Black Lives Matters street murals popping up in cities around the country. These efforts, meant to represent a commitment to social justice in local communities, have received praise from community members and some public figures. But they""ve also garnered criticism from activists who are pushing their mayors and governors to move past symbolism and institute immediate policy changes. Rather than ordering the words painted on streets, activists argue, lawmakers should take action to protect Black lives in real time — by enacting the policies that Black organizers have been calling for since before the Floyd protests began. So far, few of those in power are getting the message. ""It's not enough. What we're asking for is not, like, a symbolic recognition of how Black lives matter,"" said Delilah Pierre, an organizer with the Tallahassee Community Action Committee. The Florida state capital is one of the latest cities to paint the now-familiar yellow-and-black mural across a major intersection. ""We're asking for that to be something that's in practice. We're asking for real systemic change to the system that oppresses and marginalizes Black people."" The Black Lives Matter street art, meanwhile, originated more as a way to troll President Donald Trump, who has called Black Lives Matter a ""hate group."" Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser commissioned the first BLM mural in early June, in response to Trump""s militarization of the city""s downtown and use of chemicals to clear protesters in front of the White House. She renamed the intersection across from the White House Black Lives Matter plaza and had the words painted across the asphalt in bold yellow lettering. More than a dozen other cities have since adopted the practice. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was one of the first to follow suit, ordering Black Lives Matter to be painted on Fifth Avenue, directly across from Trump Tower. The Rev. Al Sharpton and members of the Central Park Five participated in its unveiling. Still, activists say that in most places, political leaders have not matched those expressions of support with the kinds of policy changes that would tangibly improve people""s lives. As coronavirus cases continue to spike, Black and Latino patients comprise the majority of cases and deaths. Since Floyd""s killing in late May, more African Americans have been killed by police officers, only further injecting energy into the protest movement against police violence. State and national legislative leaders, meanwhile, have not responded with the kind of urgency the colliding crises demand. Congress has not passed a relief package since May while more than 30 million Americans could be without any income if unemployment relief is not renewed by the end of July. A rent crisis remains on the horizon as more than one-third of Americans missed rent and mortgage payments at the beginning of the month. Black and Latino populations stand to bear the brunt of these calamities, as unemployment remains disproportionately high in both communities. Those realities prompted D.C. activists to immediately paint a counter-message on the street next to Mayor Bowser""s Black Lives Matter mural: ""Defund the police."" Black Lives Matter D.C. has also since released a statement condemning the mural and calling it ""performative."" ""The folks who painted that ... they know very well that that wasn't a genuine thing by Muriel Bowser,"" said Sean Blackmon, an organizer with the D.C.-based Stop Police Terror Project, which organizes nationwide against police violence. ""And so what that really says is, ""if you think that Black Lives Matter, Muriel Bowser, then you must defund the police."""" ""They paint the letters of your movement on a street and are hailed across the country but they're not willing to look you in the eye and talk about solutions,"" said Jessica Byrd, co-founder of Three Point Strategies and an organizer with the Movement for Black Lives. ""I mean, it takes an incredible amount of cognitive dissonance to believe that a mural is enough and that it could replace a conversation about structural change in the city."" In some municipalities, leaders have answered the protesters' calls for change. Minneapolis, the catalyst for the wave of anti-racism protests happening around the world, advanced a ballot measure that would disband the city""s police department and establish a new security and violence prevention force. So far, it is the only city to pass legislation disbanding police since Floyd""s death. But with pressure rising from local organizers and the national outcry, a growing number of state and local leaders have announced plans to decrease police budgets for the upcoming fiscal year and redirect the funds to communities of color. Los Angeles"" city council cut $150 million from its police budget. San Francisco has enacted similar measures, pledging to cut from the city""s police budget and reallocate the funds to programs benefiting the local Black community. Defenders of the murals say that art still has a special place in social movements, and the murals are not intended to be a substitute for policy changes. Some protesters have, themselves, erected Black Lives Matter art of their own. It""s a different dynamic, however, Pierre explained, because there is a unique understanding behind the work. ""I think when activists go out, and they create those symbols, and they've been doing the work of really trying to uplift Black people in their communities, it's way different. Because they're coming from the perspective of love. And it's kind of a sign of what's to come,"" she said. ""We can't stop at paintings. We have to really change the system, especially the way that Black people and the police interact."""
politico|"John Lewis was eulogized Thursday afternoon at the same historic Atlanta church that Martin Luther King Jr. once presided over, a nod to the centrality of the Black church for Lewis and other Civil Rights leaders of his generation. The church""s role is now changing. Even as they inherit Lewis"" mantle, Black Lives Matter organizers say the Black church does not serve as the organizing hub, haven and heartbeat for their movement that it did in the 1950""s and 60""s. It""s yet another sign that the Civil Rights movement is undergoing a generational transformation, and is taking on the characteristics of the young, less traditional and decidedly less religious organizers now filling the streets. ""The church tradition has been very much focused on a singular male leader,"" Janaya Khan, international ambassador for Black Lives Matter, explained. ""This movement that we have now in Black Lives Matter has been led by and informed by women, queer and trans people — you know, the despised of the despised."" The tension is emblematic of a larger, ongoing conflict between activists, religious centers and age groups. Some organizers feel alienated by parts of the Black church""s doctrines and people of faith are grappling with how to embrace the Black Lives Matter movement and all of its members. Some members of the old guard Black churches say that dynamic has always been part of the debate between churches and movement leaders, or among churches, themselves, on the best way to get involved in the push for civil rights. Lewis died of pancreatic cancer on July 17, the same day his friend and fellow activist, Rev. C.T. Vivian, passed away. Like many titans in the fight for Black civil rights in the 1960s, Lewis and Vivian""s connections to the church were inextricable from their organizing. Lewis, whose higher education began at a Baptist college, grew up preaching to the chickens on his family farm and considered a career in the church before entering politics. Vivian, himself was a minister in addition to his work as a political strategist and organized Nashville""s first desegregation sit-ins while still in seminary. King once called Vivian, ""the greatest preacher who ever lived."" These connections to the church provided both men with a moral compass for the non-religious spaces they occupied, whether in Lewis"" capacity as the conscience of Congress or Vivian""s long standing post at the White House, where he provided civil rights counsel to four sitting U.S. presidents. ""You don't get a civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s without the church,"" said Raphael Warnock, the senior pastor at Ebenezer Church and a Democratic candidate for Georgia""s U.S. Senate seat. ""When we see those marchers in the streets, that's literally the black church pouring out of the pews into the public square — singing, in order to redeem the soul of America."" The activists protesting the killing of George Floyd and racist policing today embrace the core message that informed Lewis and Vivian""s life work: civil rights issues are moral issues. But there are some key differences between the current Movement for Black Lives, as it is known post-Floyd, and prior civil rights campaigns. While many Black churches were sites of planning meetings and safe havens for organizers, demonstrations in this era tend to find their center on social media, in the homes of allies or on the streets themselves. More, the decentralized structure of the Black Lives Matter movement runs counter to the framework of Black churches, which are often led by a single person or small group of people. And unlike a majority of leaders of prior Black-led movements, Black Lives Matter is neither driven primarily by men. Women and members of the LGBTQ community are among Black Lives Matter""s founders, as are many of the leaders of its more than 40 chapters across the country. ""I think the black church failed in terms of healing the issues of patriarchy and homophobia. And those two issues are fundamental to the Black Lives Matter movement,"" said Cornel West, Professor of Philosophy at Harvard University. ""White supremacy is evil. The Black church historically has tried to hit it head-on and oftentimes has been magnificent. But male supremacy, homophobia and transphobia are evil too. They""ve got to hit those with the same level of intensity as they hit white supremacy. That""s the challenge and the test of the Black church these days."" Members of the clergy have publicly recognized this disconnect. In June, a group of theologians composed a public statement in support of Black Lives Matter, recognizing its connections to the Biblical teachings they study. Dr. Eboni Marshall Turman, Assistant Professor of Theology and African-American religion at Yale University, authored the letter. ""We have...forgotten who we are as a church and we have devolved into a certain kind of white, pious evangelicalism that really has us performing in black face,"" Turman said. ""We have dismissed the intersection of justice and righteousness and community from this idea of personal piety."" Activists across generations and beliefs, however, can agree on this point: while their efforts may look different, it is impossible to have one without the other. What ""is missed often about what these movements have in common is we may not be of a religious tradition, but we absolutely are of a spiritual tradition,"" Khan said, citing the examples of Lewis and Ella Baker, another civil rights forbear with ties to the church. ""There is something inherently supernatural and spiritual about the work of social justice and the work of change."" The goals of the Black Lives Matter movement also intersect with the objectives of many liberation-focused Black churches: self-sufficient, politically empowered Black communities, equal access to resources and deep regard for public safety. Al Sharpton, Baptist minister and founder of the National Action Network, said that to suggest that the movement""s conflict with the church is a new phenomenon would be ""rewriting of the movement."" ""This is nothing new,"" Sharpton said. ""Martin Luther King used to call it 'creative tension.' We need the push and pull between different disciplines and different tactics to come up with the best way."" Sharpton pointed out that of the Big Six civil rights leaders of the 1960s who coordinated the first March on Washington — James Farmer, Roy Wilkins, A. Phillip Randolph, Whitney Young, King and Lewis — only one, King, was a preacher. Many, as in the case of Roy Wilkins, were often hostile to the church as an organizing tool and felt it got in the way of the movement""s goals. It""s a pattern that repeats itself in the Black Lives Matter era, Sharpton argued. ""It's not like you don't have church leaders that don't disagree with me,"" he said. ""And it's not like you don't have Black Lives Matter folks that say ""he ain't with us even though he's black, and he says he is."" There's searching on all sides. Can we make it all work is the challenge."" Two of Black Lives Matter""s founders, Patrisse Cullors and Alicia Garza, have spoken at National Action Network events and gone on Sharpton""s show ""to show operational unity."" Younger activists have deferred to Sharpton in their organizing, as was the case in Minneapolis during George Floyd""s funeral, where it was accepted that Sharpton would deliver Floyd""s eulogy. Activists of all generations, genders and sexual and religious orientations are united, moreover, in their view of how Lewis"" civil rights record has informed the work they have done and continue to do. His legacy proves especially critical now, following the more than two months of protests against racism and police violence that have made Lewis"" quintessential phrase ""good trouble"" newly relevant. Speaking at Lewis' funeral at Ebenezer Baptist Church, former President Barack Obama, weighed in from the pulpit on the biggest political issues of the day: Voting rights, fair Congressional representation and the presence of federal agents in America""s cities. ""We may no longer have to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar in order to cast a ballot, but even as we sit here, there are those in power who are doing their darnedest to discourage people from voting by closing polling locations and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision,"" Obama, the nation's first Black president, said. Yet Lewis"" work, Obama continued, ""vindicated the faith in our founding."" Several organizers said Lewis"" legacy has helped them push the boundaries of what could be possible in their work. Patrisse Cullors, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter, evoked Lewis"" words from his speech at the first March on Washington in her address to the Democratic National Committee""s platform meeting on Monday. ""Hearkening back to Lewis, ""we are now involved in a serious revolution,"""" Cullors said, borrowing language from his March on Washington address. Cullors encouraged the Democrats to embrace ""sea changes"" recommended by the Black Lives Matter movement, namely the BREATHE Act, which would limit federal ability to deploy police forces to cities and dramatically decrease the defense budget. ""It's not enough just to have a seat at the table, we want to create a table or we want to flip the table over,"" said Angela Peoples, an organizer and director of Black Womxn For, an organization that aims to galvanize the political power of Black women and gender non-conforming folks. ""But even being able to name that as something that we want or that we even think is possible is only because those that have come before us have pushed their existence and their reality to see beyond what's possible."" This was true even in the face of bodily danger, something that has been associated with Lewis"" legacy as a protester. Jesse Jackson, former presidential candidate and founder of the multiethnic organizing Rainbow Coalition said that Lewis ""became immortal"" on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody Sunday in 1965. During that day, Lewis"" skull was cracked by a state trooper with a billy club. ""John never stopped fighting,"" Jackson said. ""He had no fear and was always a really gentle and tough-minded person."" He also had his eyes on the future, even in his final days: one of the last pieces of legislation Lewis supported was the Justice in Policing Act, which aims to limit police violence. The bill, which would establish a national standard for police tactics and limit officers"" use of force, passed in the House on June 25, exactly one month after Floyd was killed. Kayla Reed, director of the organizing group Action St. Louis and co-creator of the Movement for Black Lives"" Electoral Justice Project, said Lewis"" legacy inspired her career of activism. ""I think it highlights what is possible,"" Reed said. ""When we think about how some people put a beginning and end to movements, that movement work is actually a lifelong commitment."""
politico|"President Donald Trump on Wednesday called New York City""s decision to paint ""Black Lives Matter"" on Fifth Avenue a ""symbol of hate,"" rebuking his home town's embrace of a rallying cry that has stirred nationwide protests against racism. The president""s latest comments attacking the Black Lives Matter movement drew swift condemnation from New York City police reform groups. Trump also criticized cuts to the city""s police department and wrote on Twitter that Mayor Bill de Blasio""s decision to paint Black Lives Matter on the street outside Trump Tower is ""denigrating this luxury Avenue"". ""This will further antagonize New York""s Finest, who LOVE New York & vividly remember the horrible BLM chant, ""Pigs In A Blanket, Fry ""Em Like Bacon,"""" Trump wrote. ""Maybe our GREAT Police, who have been neutralized and scorned by a mayor who hates & disrespects them, won""t let this symbol of hate be affixed to New York""s greatest street. Spend this money fighting crime instead!"" De Blasio told MSNBC earlier Wednesday morning that the street painting would be completed outside Trump Tower in a matter of days. The mayor's office ordered the letters painted on Fifth Avenue last week. ""Obviously we want the president to hear it because he's never shown respect for those three words,"" de Blasio said. ""When he hears Black Lives Matter, he presents a horrible negative reality of something that doesn't exist, and he misses the underlying meaning that we're saying we have to honor the role of African Americans in our history and our society."" Activists said Trump's tweet distracted from efforts to combat police brutality. ""The only symbol of hate is President Trump. This is just his latest attempt to brazenly push hate and try to divert our attention from the urgent civil rights issues facing our communities, from violent policing to the pandemic,"" Carolyn Martinez-Class, a spokesperson for the New York City organization Communities United for Police Reform, said in a statement to POLITICO. The painting of Black Lives Matter on Fifth Avenue follows the passing of the city""s budget in the early hours of Wednesday morning. While the $88.19 billion budget cuts funding to the police department, reform activists were unhappy and said the reductions did not go far enough in reducing the NYPD""s role in the city. Martinez-Class called on the mayor to ""go beyond performative gestures of support and actually make changes to abusive, racist policing in New York City to show that Black lives really matter to him."" In the weeks since the police killing of George Floyd ignited mass demonstrations opposing police violence, Trump has not adopted the message of Black Lives Matter protesters. In mid-June, he told Fox News that he thought many demonstrators who took to the streets were unaware what they were protesting for. Trump has not said the words ""black lives matter,"" and has instead focused on defending law enforcement from accusations of systemic racism. Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered Black Lives Matter to be painted near the White House in June, as well as ordering a nearby street to be renamed ""Black Lives Matter Plaza"" in a rebuke to the president. That move was panned by some activists who characterized it as an empty gesture without tangible steps to reduce police funding. Trump""s tweet claimed Black Lives Matter protesters chanted the slogan ""Pigs In A Blanket, Fry ""Em Like Bacon"" — an accusation he has leveled against the movement in past tweets. Protesters at a Black Lives Matter march chanted the phrase in 2015 in a Minnesota demonstration. There have not been reports of protesters using the chant during the demonstrations following Floyd""s death. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany also cited the ""pigs in a blanket"" chant as Trump""s rationale for standing against the Black Lives Matter painting. ""What the president was noting is that that symbol, when you look at some of the things that have been chanted by Black Lives Matter, like ""pigs in a blanket, fry ""em like bacon,"" that""s not an acceptable phrase to paint on our streets,"" McEnany said at a Wednesday press briefing. She added that Trump believes ""all Black lives matter."" Rudy Giuliani, the president""s personal lawyer and a former mayor of New York, echoed Trump""s opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement when speaking with reporters at the White House on Wednesday. ""Black Lives Matter is a Marxist organization,"" Giuliani said, adding that he was against the painting of Fifth Avenue. ""Black Lives Matter has been planning to destroy the police for three years."" Erin Durkin contributed to this report."
politico|"The Black Lives Matter movement is buckling under the strain of its own success, with tensions rising between local chapters and national leaders over the group""s goals, direction — and money. From the beginning, Black Lives Matter was a grassroots effort, born in the streets with no central hierarchy. The idea: to keep power concentrated in the hands of its members, the people. That""s changing. After a summer of protests that made Black Lives Matter a household name, those atop the movement are making a series of moves to alter its power structure: organizing a political action committee, forming corporate partnerships, adding a third organizing arm and demanding an audience with President-elect Joe Biden. The moves have triggered mutiny in the ranks. Ten local chapters are severing ties with the Black Lives Matter Global Network, as the national leadership is known. They are furious that Patrisse Cullors, its remaining co-founder, assumed the role of executive director of the group and made these decisions without their input. That""s a move, that, to some, signaled a rebuke of its ""leaderful"" structure, which gave every member an equal say and kept anyone — including a founder — from overreaching. The operations of Black Lives Matter have always been opaque, with thousands of members and dozens of affiliates. Two of its three co-founders are no longer affiliated with the movement — even as they continue to represent Black Lives Matter on TV. Local Black Lives Matter activists say national leaders cut them off from funding and decision-making, leaving them broke and taking the movement in a direction with which they fundamentally disagree. And as the Black Lives Matter movement grows in influence, with millions in donations and celebrity endorsements, local organizers argue they""re the ones in the streets pushing for change — and they""re not getting their due. ""There's been intentional erasure,"" of local activists, said Sheri Dickerson, lead organizer with Black Lives Matter Oklahoma City. ""People assume that that money is distributed to local chapters. That is not the case. People also assume that when actions are made, that national leadership has the support and agreement from this collective that what they're saying is representative of us. And that's certainly not the case."" The fallout follows an all-too familiar trajectory of other grassroots movements. And how its leaders respond to the call for accountability could have major implications for Black Lives Matter""s long-term influence — just as an administration potentially more sympathetic to its goals comes into power. With Cullors at its helm, Black Lives Matter this year positioned itself as a new leader in activism and politics at the forefront of the national reckoning on race. After forming the PAC, which helped fund its ad campaigns to mobilize Black voters, it formalized its third arm, Black Lives Matter Grassroots, to focus entirely on activism. But the spotlight on these changes is now exposing fractures in its operation and leadership structure as its ground troops go public with their complaints. ""We became chapters of Black Lives Matter as radical Black organizers embracing a collective vision for Black people engaging in the protracted struggle for our lives against police terrorism,"" 10 local chapters wrote in an open letter last week. ""With a willingness to do hard work that would put us at risk, we expected that the central organizational entity … would support us chapters in our efforts to build communally."" The 10 chapters that signed the letter, the self-proclaimed #BLM10, laid out a half-dozen points of contention and long-standing grievances. Cullors is chief among their complaints, they said, arguing she made a power grab when she appointed herself executive director of the Black Lives Matter Global Network. They also said there""s a lack of transparency over money the movement has raised and how chapters can access it. Since Black Lives Matter formed in 2013, the chapters complained they""ve received scant financial support, despite repeated promises. Members have brought this up as early as 2016 and frustrated chapters planned to go public with their grievances months ago. But they were encouraged to wait and discuss the issues with Cullors privately. Those discussions were not productive, they say. ""We didn't have an opportunity to agree to discuss. Nothing,"" said Yahné Ndgo, a lead organizer with Black Lives Matter Philadelphia. ""So then we ask questions, and we are told no answers."" Cullors declined comment. But representatives with the Black Lives Matter Global Network disputed the #BLM10""s complaints in an emailed statement, arguing most of the quarreling chapters are not formally affiliated with the global network. Instead, they say, the #BLM10 are using the Black Lives Matter name in a bid for credibility and money. And because of its funding structure, the network is limited by how much it can give local chapters. ""Chapters that are a part of BLM Grassroots joined a unity pledge that laid out a set of organizing principles,"" the statement reads, adding that most of the #BLM10 declined to sign on. ""Regardless of their affiliation, we know these groups will continue to do good and necessary work in their communities."" Black Lives Matters co-founders Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi, who are no longer affiliated with the global network, and representatives from the Movement for Black Lives declined to comment for this story. Garza is now principal of the Black Futures Lab, a think tank that studies Black political power. Things came to a head this year when the confluence of several crises — the coronavirus, systemic racism and economic turmoil — highlighted both the gravity of the work that Black Lives Matter does and discrepancies in its execution. By the end of June, the Black Lives Matter Global Network had raised more than $13 million in donations and cemented its role as a political power and organizing force. But local organizers said they saw little or no money and were forced to crowdfund to stay afloat. Some organizers say they were barely able to afford gas or housing. ""What supporters see is national folks talking about trying to get a meeting with Biden, while kids are literally outside of my door asking for food,"" said April Goggans, lead organizer with Black Lives Matter D.C. If this dynamic sounds familiar, that""s because it is, said Omar Wasow, a political science professor at Princeton University, who studies protest movements. ""It's almost a truism that movements will fracture over time,"" Wasow said. ""It's exceedingly hard to hold movements together over the long haul."" Activist organizations often split along factions as members disagree about how to advocate for change, Wasow said. Typically, they disagree about whether it""s more effective to work within the system or continue to agitate from the outside. And Black movement leaders from different groups have been at odds over reforms even earlier this year. Campaign Zero, a racial justice group focused on ending police violence, was widely criticized by a number of Black Lives Matter activists for advocating for solutions they felt didn't move the needle far enough on police reform. Its #8CantWait campaign, which called for an eight-step approach to ending police violence, took a lot of heat for calling for measures that were tried and failed, while relying on shoddy data to underline them. The Campaign Zero team, originally led by Johnetta Elzie, DeRay McKesson, Brittany Packnett Cunningham and Samuel Sinyangwe, later issued a public apology for rushing out the campaign so quickly. Cunningham later resigned from Campaign Zero. Which is to say, the splintering of Black Lives Matter is no anomaly. ""I've seen it play out on gender lines. I've seen it played out on class lines. I've seen it play out on the national-versus-local lines,"" said Justin Hansford, executive director of the Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center at Howard University, who helped lead protests in Ferguson in the wake of Mike Brown""s death. ""And this seems to be the last of those dynamics playing out within the organization itself."" This is not the first time Black Lives Matter faced internal conflict. The Black Lives Matter Global Network and Movement for Black Lives are made up of thousands of organizers and dozens of associated organizing groups. While united in their main goals, getting consensus on key decisions has been tricky, particularly as the audience for their work has grown exponentially along with the appetite for solutions to the issues they are fighting. Keeping track of new developments within the Black Lives Matter movement can be confusing even for insiders. Its structure purportedly gave organizers equal say in decision-making. But ultimately, that sowed confusion about who was formally affiliated with the movement and therefore eligible for funds raised by the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation. This frustrated a number of longtime Black Lives Matter members. It""s what prompted leaders from stronghold chapters like Washington, Chicago and Philadelphia to sign the letter. They say they didn""t receive guidance or support from the movement they helped build, despite voicing their concerns as early as 2016. ""From the first time somebody said the word Black Lives Matter, there was confusion because there was always this idea that the decision of who gets credit was a political one,"" Hansford said. ""All throughout the movement, there's always been a question of who gets credit and following that, who gets the reward."" In July, affiliate chapters were invited to apply for funding the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation received in the form of unrestricted, multiyear grants up to $500,000. But the #BLM10 say it wasn""t clear which chapters were ""legitimate"" affiliates. As a result, few qualified for help. That stoked tensions within the ranks, particularly as public opinion toward Black Lives Matter began to slip. They also disagreed with the new focus on national politics over local fights for police reform. There was ""absolutely no way"" they would have agreed with those decisions if local chapters were consulted, they said. ""That being a central message and a central focus for the entire nation? Absolutely not something that we would have been aligned with,"" Ndgo said, referencing the ""protest to the polls"" messaging that Cullors was amplifying ahead of November. Tensions also flared among some organizers when Cullors — along with Garza and Tometi, made the rounds on cable TV. ""Chapters who we know, who we've been working with, who … do this work, have not been acknowledged or supported, yet you will find them talked about either on stage or in interviews on TV,"" Goggans said. ""They might as well just be pictures on a fundraising brochure — we all might as well be."" There was also a disconnect around the scope and focus of Black Lives Matter""s organizing. While chapters focused on police accountability and funding — a largely local debate that has gained national attention — they were unaware that leaders of the global network had shifted their efforts. ""I'm not begging Biden, or Harris, for any type of sit-down or meeting,"" said Chanelle Helm, an organizer with Black Lives Matter Louisville. ""I'm trying to get my mayor out of his seat, because he keeps doing the same shit he""s doing."" Three other chapters in the Black Lives Matter""s Southern region are unaffiliated with the #BLM10 but support their complaints. In a letter shared with POLITICO, they said the restructuring of the Black Lives Matter organization reflects ""a growing gap"" between the chapters and national leadership. The disaffected chapters are no longer affiliated with the Black Lives Matter Global Network, they said, but they will continue the work they""ve been doing for years. And, they said, they will continue to work under the Black Lives Matter banner. ""This is our name, we've worked for it. And I feel that chapters have really honored that name and made it strong,"" said Amika Tendaji, a lead organizer with Black Lives Matter Chicago. Dickerson, of Black Lives Matter Oklahoma City, cited the famous scene from ""What""s Love Got to Do With It,"" when Tina Turner tells Ike Turner the only thing she wants from him in their divorce is her name. ""People recognize our power within our communities,"" she said. ""We're not a brand. We are a revolution."""
politico|"States and cities across the country have overhauled their marijuana policies in recent months, propelled by the Black Lives Matter protests over racial inequality and police brutality. Since protests began in early June, many states and municipalities have adopted new cannabis regulations. Nashville, Tenn., stopped prosecuting minor marijuana possession cases. Portland, Ore., redirected all cannabis tax revenue away from the Portland Police Bureau. Colorado""s Legislature passed a long-stalled proposal to address social equity and scrap old marijuana convictions, and Sonoma County, Calif., and New York state expanded their programs to erase cannabis criminal records. Black Americans have been disproportionately affected by marijuana enforcement for decades and are four times more likely to be arrested than white people despite similar usage rates, according to the ACLU. Lawmakers and advocates say the racial justice protests that began after George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others were killed have persuaded wavering elected officials to support drug policy changes, motivated prosecutors to take long-awaited action and opened the door for new conversations about marijuana policy reform. In October, Democratic Sens. Sharif Street and Daylin Leach introduced a bill to legalize marijuana in Pennsylvania. Street said that at the outset, only about three Democratic lawmakers supported the bill publicly. The legalization bill probably won""t pass this session, but after racial protests began in Pennsylvania, support among his Democratic colleagues grew exponentially. In July, 15 of Pennsylvania""s 21 Democratic senators, including Street, signed a letter urging passage of the bill. ""The fact is, that it was after all of this — these social protests — that we had massive amounts of Democratic members decide now is the time they're prepared to sign on to a letter"" calling for legalization, Street said. Cannabis was legalized in Colorado almost eight years ago, but without a social equity program or the expungement of cannabis-related convictions. Democratic state Rep. Jonathan Singer first pushed for expungement of cannabis records in 2014 and has pressed for marijuana possession charges to be wiped ever since. But Singer said it was the protests around racial justice that finally got the proposal to the governor""s desk with strong bipartisan support — the social equity and expungements bill only garnered one ""no"" vote in the state Senate. Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed the bill into law at the end of June. ""We probably wouldn't have seen a cannabis equity bill introduced this late in the session without the Black Lives Matter movement,"" Singer said. ""There's been a collective awakening."" Even anti-legalization advocates say the public""s interest in marijuana policy as a criminal justice issue has been piqued. ""It's actually interestingly afforded us the opportunity to have conversations we would not normally have,"" said Kevin Sabet, founder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, which advocates for decriminalization of marijuana, but not legalization. Sabet said in recent weeks he""s talked with racial justice advocates about how to remove penalties for marijuana use without full legalization. Sabet also said he does not believe those conversations have had a major effect on policy so far. ""There has not been as big of an impact on the conversation as maybe we thought there could be in the beginning,"" he said, pointing out that full legalization was not included in the 2020 Democratic party platform. ""I certainly haven't heard of anyone who wasn't in favor of legalization before come out and say, ""Well, this is now making me in favor of it,"""" Sabet said. Indeed, many of the states and cities that did change their marijuana policies were already moving in that direction. Nashville spent the last six years reducing the number of marijuana arrests, before the protests motivated District Attorney General Glenn Funk to stop prosecuting possession entirely. Portland was already reassessing where cannabis tax revenue was directed, and the ""defund the police"" movement provided the catalyst for the city council to change the budget. In many of these cases, conversations around racial justice simply pushed legislation over the finish line in a jurisdiction that was already working on it. And it""s clear that the racial justice conversation has not convinced the most vocal skeptics. In Pennsylvania, for example, the state lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police is not changing its anti-legalization position. Even some Democratic lawmakers in the state remain unconvinced about the current legalization effort, despite the demonstrations. State Sen. Judy Schwank is one Democrat who did not sign Street""s legalization letter. While her constituents support the concept of recreational sales, Schwank said she believes there should be more talks about what the policy looks like before the legislature begins to have hearings. Schwank also said the Black Lives Matter protests have not changed the minds of her voters, who are more interested in cannabis as an economic boon. Those same dollar signs, she said, are also more likely to sway House Republicans — the strongest opponents of legalization. ""In more urban areas, I think they understand that this is an issue whose time has come, and the Black Lives Matter movement has put that into focus,"" Schwank said. ""But whether it's moved the ""not over my dead body"" guys, I don't know."" On Capitol Hill, it isn""t clear that racial justice protests have affected the motivation to pass marijuana policy reform. While many of the issue""s most prominent advocates have been silent on federal legalization in the last two months, House leaders are now considering a vote on the MORE Act — which would remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act and expunge some records — sometime this fall. ""The conversation around drug criminalization has changed a lot, and I do believe that people are now looking at it with a racial justice lens,"" said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). While marijuana reform will not end police brutality on its own, Ocasio-Cortez said, marijuana enforcement is often used as a pretense for police violence — and lawmakers can easily look at the issue from both directions. ""There are these two areas that are in tension with one another,"" she said. In June, Congress tried to reach an agreement on police reform. The House passed a sweeping policing bill largely along partisan lines. Senate Republicans introduced a more modest package of reforms, which Senate Democrats ultimately killed because it did not go far enough. Missing from either chamber""s proposal was anything that would overhaul federal marijuana policies. Even many of the most ardent champions of marijuana legalization as criminal justice reform were silent. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called for marijuana legalization on the Senate floor, but Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) — who both co-sponsor legalization bills — did not. Reps. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) wrote a letter asking their House colleagues to include marijuana legalization in the policing bill — but they did so alone. Even House Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), who introduced the MORE Act, did not join them. ""You have parts of this caucus ... that are quite conservative, or have very specific ideas about how marijuana should be legalized,"" said Ocasio-Cortez, who did not sign the Blumenauer-Lee letter, but who has pushed Congress to vote on criminal justice-related marijuana legislation before industry issues such as banking. ""The amount of disagreement over that would really stall ... any sort of legalization effort."" Ocasio-Cortez said local governments have a greater ability to address decriminalization and legalization. While state legislatures often move more quickly on controversial drug policy issues than Congress, it still took six years for Singer""s marijuana expungement bill to pass in overwhelmingly pro-cannabis Colorado. The term-limited legislator will leave office at the end of this year, and he said he couldn""t have lived with himself if he had not done everything in his power to get this done. ""This is one of those famous tipping points in history,"" Singer said. ""You can never quite predict where these tipping points occur, but when they do happen, you have to seize the moment and do the best you can, because you never know when the pendulum is gonna swing back the other way."""
politico|"President Donald Trump has spent weeks attacking the Black Lives Matter movement, and it's moving the polls — though not necessarily in a way that boosts his electoral chances. Voters' favorable views of the Black Lives Matter movement has dropped by 9 percentage points since June, including a 13-point dip among Republicans, according to new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll. The shift comes after the recent police shooting of another Black man: Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis., last week. Trump's recent emphasis on the protests in cities like Kenosha and Portland, Ore., isn't exactly to his political benefit. Despite Trump's attempts to cast himself as the law-and-order candidate since George Floyd's killing in May, the POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows more voters trust former Vice President Joe Biden over Trump to handle public safety, 47 percent to 39 percent. Voters also prefer Biden on race relations by a 19-point margin. Though a narrow majority of voters still view the Black Lives Matter movement favorably, bipartisan support has eroded over the past two months, as Trump has encouraged police violence against protesters, called the Black Lives Matter movement a ""symbol of hate,"" ""discriminatory,"" ""Marxist"" and ""bad for Black people."" This week, Trump has tried to pin blame on Biden for violence in American cities. The dip in support for Black Lives Matter, reflected across multiple polls in recent weeks, doesn""t come as a surprise to activists nor Democratic pollsters who expected Republican backlash to the movement""s newfound support. Favorability for Black Lives Matter dropped from 61 percent support in June to 52 percent now, according to the POLITICO/Morning Consult poll conducted Friday through Sunday. ""This is the direct effect of the strategy of Donald Trump and Fox News,"" said veteran Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher. ""The movement to a certain extent, over the last month or so, had been losing ground in controlling the narrative."" The protests were ""resoundingly successful"" in creating an ""inflection point"" around racism, Belcher said. But the drop in favorability, he continued, comes as Trump increasingly describes the protests as ""violence"" and ""anarchy,"" rather than about police brutality and racial injustice. ""That is a huge problem for Donald Trump — if he's in fact trying to be the safety and law and order candidate, and he's losing in the public mind on that front,"" Belcher said. Since Blake was shot seven times in the back by police last month, protests have continued in the state, and riots have resulted in businesses burned to the ground or vandalized. Last week, a white teenager, Kyle Rittenhouse, allegedly shot three protesters, killing two, during the third night of demonstrations in Kenosha. Trump has not condemned Rittenhouse — who on social media promoted ""Blue Lives Matter"" and support for the president — despite the criminal charges against him, and the president has largely remained silent on the shooting of Blake. During his visit to Kenosha on Tuesday, Trump did not meet with Blake's family but held a roundtable with local law enforcement. Republicans are betting Trump""s ""law and order"" playbook — which echoes 1960s-era GOP strategies on racial divisions for which the party later apologized prior to Trump's ascendance — will benefit him electorally, energizing his predominately white base and appealing to the white women Republicans lost in 2018. As unrest in Kenosha unfolded last week, departing White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said that increased ""chaos"" and ""anarchy"" would boost Trump""s reelection prospects. But there""s been little evidence to date, including in the new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, that Trump""s bet is swaying voters. ""As President Donald Trump continues to drive his ""law and order"" message amid a new wave of civil unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden maintains a comfortable trust advantage over the incumbent when it comes to who voters trust to handle public safety,"" said Kyle Dropp, co-founder and chief research officer at Morning Consult. Republican pollster Chris Wilson asserted the shift in support for Black Lives Matter ""does put Biden at risk"" as unrest continues in Democratically-run cities. But Wilson, CEO of WPA Intelligence, said the data shows ""that the protests are more an opportunity than automatic win for Trump."" ""Trump has to navigate both a rhetorical and policy obstacle course to show the right amount of strength and engagement in protecting Americans and their property, without veering into ignoring the underlying issues that Americans believe exist and justified the protests before they turned violent,"" Wilson said. ""But this is the first issue in months that has the real possibility of shaking up the election and giving Trump the ability to make big gains."" Overall, the new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows Trump with a 42 percent approval rating, unchanged from last week, before the Republican convention. The poll surveyed 1,988 registered voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. Biden addressed Trump's attacks and the racial reckoning across the country on Monday. ""Does anyone believe there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is reelected?"" Biden said in a speech in Pennsylvania. ""We need justice in America. And we need safety in America."" Morning Consult's latest presidential tracking poll shows Biden 8 points ahead of Trump, equal to his lead before both conventions last month. Some other public surveys do show a slight tightening in the Biden-Trump race, though there is still a lack of direct data tying the protests or shootings of civilians in Kenosha and Portland to Biden or Trump""s standing electorally. Cliff Albright, co-founder of the voter engagement group Black Voters Matter, which is one of hundreds of organizations engaged in the movement, considered the dip in support for Black Lives Matter ""predictable"" and said it could provide a needed gut check on ""overconfidence"" among Democrats. ""We don't want to underestimate Trump,"" he said. ""But also we're not getting carried away by some of the messaging and some of the poll variation that we've seen."" Democratic pollster Terrance Woodbury said a recent statewide poll in Georgia conducted by his firm, HIT Strategies, found 79 percent of voters in the burgeoning battleground state believe racial and ethnic discrimination is a problem in the country. ""The problem is that safety and security and crime are not at the top of white women, suburban women's priority list. Covid-19, economy and racism remain at the top of their priority list,"" said Woodbury. ""One reason why reduction in support for BLM doesn't necessarily equate to reduction of support for Biden is that Biden isn't running to be president of BLM voters."" Activists dismiss much of the polling on Black Lives Matter, pointing to the low public support in the 1950s and 1960s for integration, the March on Washington and sit-in demonstrations during the civil rights movement. And another poll released Wednesday by Grinnell College found that when the issue of racial inequality was framed around victims of police violence, respondents' views of the current state of racial equality changed. When those surveyed were reminded of Floyd""s death, those who said the country is ""very close,"" ""pretty close"" or ""already there"" on full equality for African Americans dropped from 50 percent to 31 percent. The Grinnell College poll also shows Biden leading Trump by 8 percentage points among likely voters, 49 percent to 41 percent, matching his margin in Morning Consult's latest polling. ""Trump probably should be running against Joe Biden, instead of the movement, if he wants to win in November,"" said Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party and a leader with the Movement for Black Lives coalition. ""Movements do not exist on electoral timelines. This is the tension, and the movement for Black lives is much longer and will have much more of a deeper impact than in one president and one election cycle.""

axios|"The vandalism and looting following the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police will cost the insurance industry more than any other violent demonstrations in recent history, Axios has learned. Why it matters: The protests that took place in 140 U.S. cities this spring were mostly peaceful, but the arson, vandalism and looting that did occur will result in at least $1 billion to $2 billion of paid insurance claims — eclipsing the record set in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of the police officers who brutalized Rodney King. How it works: A company called Property Claim Services (PCS) has tracked insurance claims related to civil disorder since 1950. It classifies anything over $25 million in insured losses as a ""catastrophe,"" and reports that the unrest this year (from May 26 to June 8) will cost the insurance industry far more than any prior one. Yes, but: These losses are small compared with those stemming from natural disasters like hurricanes and the wildfires that are consuming the U.S. West. Between the lines: PCS, a unit of Verisk Analytics, won't reveal an exact dollar figure from this year's violence because it wants to sell that data to clients. But it says the insured losses far outstrip the prior record of $775 million from the 1992 Rodney King demonstrations. The backstory: The last time PCS compiled insurance losses for a ""civil disorder event"" was in April 2015, when rioting erupted in Baltimore in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray from a neck injury while being transported in a police van. Of note: While U.S. companies have learned the hard way that their insurance doesn't cover business interruption related to the coronavirus, most policies emphatically do cover riot-related losses. What to watch: The insurance industry is rolling up its sleeves in anticipation of potential unrest following the November election. Go deeper:"

Why it matters: Some activists say the only solution to fixing systemic issues in law enforcement is to defund and dramatically scale back police forces nationwide. But some Republicans, including President Trump, have seized on the politically charged slogan to paint Democrats as radicals. What she's saying: ""So much of policing right now is generated and directed towards quality-of-life issues, homelessness, drug addiction, domestic violence,"" Garza said.

axios|"Protests over the killing of George Floyd generated a racial reckoning across the U.S. that also helped Native Americans and Latinos bring attention to their fight against systemic racism. Why it matters: Native Americans say the resurgent Black Lives Matter movement in response to Floyd's death helped push sports teams to change their names and logos. Latino activists say it also drew attention to their own long-ignored experiences with police abuse. Details: The Washington Football Team announced in July it was dropping its name the team had used since the 1930s, following massive racial justice protests touched off by Floyd's death. What they're saying: ""It's devastating that it took the murder of George Floyd for this to happen. It was a perfect storm.

axios|"66% of Americans support repealing qualified immunity for police officers and allowing civilians to sue officers for misconduct and excessive use of force, even if it makes law enforcement""s jobs more difficult, according to a Pew Research Center survey released Thursday. Why it matters: Qualified immunity shields government officials from liability. When applied to police officers, it makes successful prosecution of misconduct difficult. Black Lives Matters is calling for an end to qualified immunity for police, and the practice has been at the center of debate on police reform. By the numbers: Though a majority of those surveyed support ending qualified immunity, only 25% said they believe spending on local law enforcement should be decreased. 14% said funding should be reduced a little, and 12% said it should be substantially decreased. Of note: Overall, a majority of Americans (58%) say that police around the U.S. are doing an excellent or good job of protecting people from crimes. The big picture: Since George Floyd's killing while in police custody and nationwide Black Lives Matter protests, some states and cities scaled back the force that officers can use on civilians, Axios' Orion Rummler reports.

Driving the news: Patrisse Cullors, BLM co-founder and activist, spoke at the DNC's virtual party platform meeting today with a searing message about the Democrats' agenda, based on Rep. John Lewis' original ""March on Washington"" speech. Between the lines: In addition to the other amendments proposed, Cullors was advocating for the BREATHE Act, which includes defunding the police — something Biden and several other Democrats in Congress don't support.

Why it matters: 67% of the American public say they support the Black Lives Matter movement in the wake of mass protests over George Floyd's killing, with 38% of U.S. adults saying they strongly support it, according to Pew. Yet the words ""Black lives matter"" have remained politically sensitive for many Republicans, who instead choose to use the phrase ""all lives matter.""

usa_today|"""Smoking Winstons is for white boys,"" said my mother-in-law, Mom Wendy, as she recounted how she started smoking. Her mom was a smoker before there were Surgeon General warnings on cigarette packaging. Public awareness of the harms of smoking was nonexistent. For Mom Wendy, it began at age 12, when her mom asked her to light a cigarette for her on the stove. She would light it for her mom and take a puff or two. She then started to hang out with her neighbors, who had seven kids — all older Black boys, who smoked. They would joke that smoking ""Winstons"" (cigarettes without menthol) was for white boys. They were saying what they knew to be true: Black people typically smoked menthol cigarettes and white people did not. Even as kids then they could see differences in cigarette use by race. We know now that this was no coincidence, but rather the results of Big Tobacco's efforts to target Black communities and hook Black children on their deadly and addictive menthol products. Black neighborhoods have a disproportionate number of tobacco retailers with pervasive tobacco marketing, and in particular, more marketing of menthol products. The industry""s own documents reveal its history of launching these advertising campaigns. Even now, I can vividly recall the numerous billboards for cigarettes in my neighborhood. I could recreate the packaging colors, logos or mascots for each of the brands I'd see constantly, and I have never smoked a cigarette. The numbers tell this story, too. Among Black smokers 12-17 years old, 71.9% smoke menthol cigarettes. Menthol products are used disproportionately in communities of color — while nearly 85% of Black smokers and 47% of Hispanic smokers use menthol cigarettes, only 29% of white smokers do. In 2009, the Food and Drug Administration banned flavored traditional cigarettes, but menthol was left out despite calls for the agency to do so as response to racism as a public health crisis. But this week, they have the opportunity to change that. The FDA has said that it would respond by Thursday to a petition to take action on menthol. I urge the agency to do the right thing by prohibiting the sale of menthol cigarettes and tobacco products. This is one of the simplest actions we could take to improve the health of Black Americans in the years ahead. The need for action is all the more urgent against the backdrop of the pandemic, which has greatly impacted Black families. Mom Wendy stopped smoking when she contracted COVID-19 but started again after a family member became ill. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people who smoke currently or smoked previously can make you more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Action is required right now to discourage smoking and help protect Black Americans from death and disease in the future. Thankfully, Mom Wendy was able to stop smoking again last fall, but others might not be as lucky. Black communities and children should not be targeted by institutions that wish to profit from their suffering and death. I imagine for them a happier and healthier future. If the FDA does the right thing and prohibits menthol cigarettes, the possibility will come one step closer to fruition, and it will affirm that indeed Black lives matter.

usa_today|"National columnist Suzette Hackney is in Minneapolis for the trial of Derek Chauvin, reporting on the people, the scene and the mood. MINNEAPOLIS – Nearly one year to the day from when George Perry Floyd was killed about 3 miles from here, a Hennepin County jury found the man who used his knee to press the life out of him guilty of all charges, including second-degree murder. The last words Floyd uttered in his 17,026 days of life were ""I can't breathe."" As the verdict was read, I had that same feeling as I stood here, among hundreds of Floyd family supporters and other journalists. But for an entirely different reason. Throughout the 14 days of testimony – the 44 witnesses, mostly for the prosecution – the steady loop of video footage showing Floyd's traumatic death from every possible angle reinforced this inescapable fact: Chauvin's utter indifference and lack of compassion as a man lay dying under his knee. We can see and hear the desperation in those who tried to save Floyd's life but were rendered powerless. Editorial:Derek Chauvin was convicted, but the public still hasn't won I gathered with angry, hopeful, scared Minnesotans outside the Hennepin County Government Center. I was here to do my job, but it felt like my chest was going to explode. I feel this pain, this frustration, too. See, I""m Black. I have young nephews, and I pray for their safety nightly. I see how quickly a traffic stop can go left, how quickly a Black man can be killed. This case is so important. It has galvanized a movement. It has opened eyes and hearts. Black lives do matter. Black lives should matter. This is history for America. And this community is literally begging for justice. Outside the courthouse, the reaction matched the gravity of the moment: People everywhere were sobbing. Embracing. (And masked.) The crowd chanted, ""All three counts,"" a nod to the fact that Chauvin was convicted of all charges against him. During closing arguments Monday, prosecutor Steve Schleicher rightly and methodically humanized Floyd. He talked about his family and childhood. He reminded jurors and all of us watching: Floyd was a human being. He was a 46-year-old man. And but for Chauvin's assault on him, he would likely be alive today. The verdict doesn't bring him back, of course. But it's a big step in the healing process. And hopefully an even bigger step toward saving the next George Floyd.

usa_today|"Real estate purchased by a co-founder of Black Lives Matter was put under the  spotlight this month after the New York Post reported on what it called a ""buying spree"" Patrisse Khan-Cullors began in 2016. Social media users seized on the report as an indication that Khan-Cullors was being enriched by the Black Lives Matter movement. ""Unbelievable. Big pay day coming soon after the (Derek) Chauvin trial,"" read one Facebook post from April 11. That text accompanied a picture of Khan-Cullors holding up her right fist, and the text ""Black Lives Matter co-founder Khan-Cullors reportedly bought four luxury homes."" The post generated hundreds of shares and comments, including from users who suggested that Khan-Cullors was profiting from donations to Black Lives Matter. The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation has taken in about $90 million in 2020, when racial unrest exploded nationwide after the killing by police of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, according to the Associated Press. But there is no evidence to support the idea that Khan-Cullors used donations that poured in amid nationwide protests in 2020 to bankroll the purchase of four homes. Wright shooting:24 arrests as demonstrators demand justice, accountability on fourth night of Brooklyn Center protests The account that shared the Facebook post did not respond to a request for comment. The New York Post reported that Khan-Cullors has purchased four properties in recent years, though two came before 2020 brought a swell of attention and donations to Black Lives Matter. Three of those properties were in the Los Angeles area, and one was in suburban Atlanta, according to the Post. One of the Los Angeles properties cost $510,000 when Khan-Cullors purchased it in 2016. A second Los Angeles home ran her $590,000 in 2018, the Post reported. A suburban Atlanta property was purchased for $415,000 in 2020. Public records searches by USA TODAY found Khan-Cullors linked to all three of those properties. The New York Post story links back to the real estate blog Dirt for information about the purchase of a fourth property. The blog reported that Khan-Cullors purchased the home in Los Angeles"" Topanga Canyon for $1.4 million on March 30 through a limited liability company. USA TODAY was unable to verify the Topanga Canyon property purchase. The core question here is whether Khan-Cullors' purchases are linked to her BLM role, as the post implies. For this claim, like any others we fact-check, the burden of proof is on the speaker. The post provided no proof of such a connection, the author did not respond to provide any, and we found none in our research, though documents are limited given the nature of the organization and Khan-Cullors' employment history. The New York Post report, which cited the real estate blog Dirt, touched off a cascade of criticism about the real estate purchases, including from the conservative nonprofit National Legal and Policy Center. National Legal and Policy Center Chairman Peter Flaherty said in a prepared statement provided to USA TODAY that ""donors to any nonprofit group should know how the organization spends its funds"" and pointed out that the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation has not filed public IRS disclosures. The foundation received its official non-profit designation from the Internal Revenue Service in December, according to the Associated Press, and will be required to file public tax documents in the future. No public financial filings have yet been made. Khan-Cullors said there's no connection between the home purchases and her BLM role. ""To be abundantly clear, as a registered 501c3, BLMGNF cannot and did not commit any organizational resources toward the purchase of my personal property,"" Khan-Cullors said in a prepared statement . ""Any insinuation or assertion to the contrary is categorically false."" In a cease-and-desist letter responding to a press release from the policy center, the BLM foundation responded to demand the National Legal and Policy Center remove the ""insinuation"" that ""funds from the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation""s funds have been used, directly or indirectly, to purchase real estate."" Poll:Stark divide on race, policing emerges since George Floyd's death, USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll shows Khan-Cullors said in a prepared statement she has been paid a total of $120,000 from the organization since 2013 for acting as spokesperson and ""political education work,"" but she has not been paid since 2019. Khan-Cullors pointed out the myriad jobs she has held. She has two book deals, including authorship of a New York Times best-selling memoir. The Los Angeles Times reported last year that Khan-Cullors signed a production deal with Warner Brothers ""to develop scripted dramas and comedies, docuseries and animated programming for children, young adults and families."" Khan-Cullors also noted that she is a public speaker, owns a gallery, has a deal with YouTube and teaches at a private liberal arts college in Arizona. The claim that Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Khan-Cullors bought four luxury homes is MISSING CONTEXT, because without additional information it could be misleading. While some social media users suggested that the purchases were evidence that Khan-Cullors had been enriched by the movement, our research revealed no evidence that Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation funds were used to purchase property. Khan-Cullors has held several other jobs in addition to her work as the organization""s volunteer executive director, including writing a memoir and developing content for Warner Brothers.

usa_today|"George Floyd""s murder in 2020 by a then-Minneapolis police officer set off nationwide demonstrations and debate about the killing of Black people by law enforcement officers. Since the start of 2019, police have shot and killed 555 Black people, according to data maintained by The Washington Post. But one recent Facebook post adds a partisan twist to the debate. ""Patiently waiting for someone to point out that all of these black people are getting shot in BLUE states, not Alabama or Mississippi,"" says an April 20 Facebook post from CJ Pearson, a high school junior whose website describes him as a ""prominent conservative online personality."" Pearson, who became famous for an online takedown of President Barack Obama when he was 14, made the claim with a screenshot from his own Twitter account. He shared the post within hours of Columbus, Ohio, police killing 16-year-old Ma'khia Bryant. But an analysis of The Washington Post""s database of fatal shootings by police shows that isn""t true. Since the start of 2019, police in red states were responsible for more fatal shootings of Black people than police in blue states. ""George Floyd, Philando Castile, and Daunte Wright""s life were taken in the deep blue state of Minnesota,"" Pearson wrote in an email to USA TODAY. But he then moved the goalposts away from states saying Breonna Taylor and Michael Brown were killed in ""cities both led by Democrats."" Those shootings occurred in Kentucky and Missouri, states carried by Republican Donald Trump in 2020. A closer look at the data shows no link between blue states and higher instances of police fatally shooting Black people, as Pearson claimed. Since the start of 2019, police have fatally shot 2,304 people, according to a USA TODAY analysis of The Washington Post""s data. Those were split nearly evenly between states that voted in 2020 for President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and states that voted for former President Trump. Narrowing the focus to shootings that killed Black people, though, reveals a difference. Of the 555 Black people shot and killed by police during that period, 298 were in red states compared with 257 in blue states. Analyzing the data on a per capita basis, fatal police shootings of Black people were about 1.5 times higher in red states than in blue states. Pearson questioned The Washington Post""s data, for which the newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize in 2016, as incomplete. The newspaper started collecting the data after discovering the FBI undercounted police shootings following the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. The Washington Post uses news media reports, social media posts and police reports to compile the data, which shows a steady rate of shootings — about 1,000 a year — since 2015. Black Americans, though, are killed at a higher rate than white Americans, according to the data. Pearson pointed to a June 2020 letter to the editor in the Wall Street Journal as evidence that the database ""has been largely criticized for incompleteness"" because it includes only fatal shootings and not other deaths in police custody. But Pearson's claim was specific to shootings. And his claim that shootings were ""all"" happening in blue states is not remotely true in any dataset. The Mapping Police Violence dataset, for example, is more comprehensive, including all police killings, including shootings, deaths from restraints and other means. George Floyd""s killing is not part of The Post""s data because he was not shot, but instead died when Officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck. But it's in the Mapping Police Violence Data. An analysis of Mapping Police Violence data, however, showed similar results to that of The Post – police killing of Black people was not higher in blue states. But is it useful to analyze fatal police encounters at the state level? Rajiv Sethi, professor of economics at Barnard College in New York, said no. The co-author of ""Shadows of Doubt: Stereotypes, Crime and Pursuit of Justice"" said the more than 18,000 police departments and sheriff""s offices in the U.S. have different procedures, training, organizational culture and leadership, and ""they""re relatively autonomous."" ""Policing in America is extremely decentralized,"" he said. ""If you want to understand policing, just looking at the state level is not terribly helpful."" Sethi""s research shows regional differences in police use of deadly force, not just shootings. But he said there is no link to whom the state backed for president. Overall homicide rates in Republican states are higher than in Democratic states as well, said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Police and Research. Using CDC data for 2017-2019, he found the homicide rate for Non-Hispanic white people was 62% higher in Republican states. For non-Hispanic Black people, the homicide rate was 35% higher in those states, he said. While Floyd""s death in the blue state of Minnesota has galvanized the Black Lives Matter movement and sparked protests against racial injustice, the mix of high-profile police killings has crossed over state political identities. For example, 16-year-old Ma""khia Bryant was killed by a police officer in Columbus, Ohio, a state that voted for Trump twice, just before the guilty verdict was read in Chauvin's trial for killing Floyd. On a list of a dozen high-profile police killings The Washington Post compiled last year, two were in Ohio. The list was split evenly between killings in red and blue states. The list also included Philando Castille, killed in Minnesota, and Ahmaud Arbery, killed in Georgia, which voted a Democrat for president in 2020 for the first time since 1992. The claim that ""all these black people are getting shot (by police) in blue states"" is FALSE. A Washington Post""s database shows fatal shootings of Black people by police are actually about 16% higher in red states than blue states. On a per capita basis, the gap is even larger, with about 50% more fatal shootings in red states. Thank you for supporting our journalism.

usa_today|"Like every high school freshman ever, 14-year-old Brandi Levy had a bad week. She missed the cut for her high school""s varsity cheerleading team. She struggled at softball practice. And she worried about her final exams. So like every high school freshman, Levy vented. ""F--- school f--- softball f--- cheer f--- everything,"" she posted to her friends on Snapchat on a Saturday afternoon. Unlike every other high school freshman, Levy""s angry snap spawned a controversy that is now before the Supreme Court. Levy""s message, it turns out, found its way to her cheerleading coaches, who suspended her from the team. Two lower courts ruled that this violated Levy""s right to free speech, and the Supreme Court will hear oral argument in her case Wednesday. When contemplating major Supreme Court cases, our natural tendency is to focus on who should win. Counterintuitively, that""s not what matters most in Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L. What matters more is what the court says about what comes next for the losing side. If the justices are wise, they will write an opinion ensuring that who loses can still protect their interests even after an adverse ruling. The question in Mahanoy concerns the proper application of a canonical First Amendment decision, Tinker v. Des Moines. In Tinker, the Supreme Court famously held that although students do not ""shed their constitutional rights ... at the schoolhouse gate,"" the First Amendment permits public schools to punish students for speech that would ""substantially disrupt"" school activities. Tinker concerned three students who were suspended for wearing black armbands to protest the Vietnam War. The court ruled that this violated the students"" right to free speech because their protest caused little in-school disturbance. Levy""s speech was different in a crucial respect. Unlike the armbands in Tinker, which were worn on campus, Levy""s speech took place entirely off-site. The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals thus held that Tinker""s carveout for student speech that would ""substantially disrupt"" school activities did not apply in the first place. Levy""s expression accordingly enjoyed full First Amendment protection. It""s easy to sympathize with Levy""s plight. Yet the 3rd Circuit""s reasoning is also quite worrisome. Perhaps that court was correct that she shouldn""t have been punished for her casual weekend snaps, but surely students who engage in more dangerous off-site speech should be. Consider the tragic story of Mallory Grossman, 12, a middle school student who was so brutally harassed by her classmates through Snapchat and other off-campus social media that she took her own life. Or Phoebe Smith, a 15-year-old freshman who hung herself after being victimized by relentless bullying, much of it online. Schools must have the power to crack down on the perpetrators of such harmful and pernicious speech, even if it takes place off-campus. But the interests on Levy""s side of the case are significant, too. Levy""s speech threatened no student or school employee. She simply wanted to vent a little and live her life. To allow the school district to punish her for such relatable frustrations — feelings that teenagers around the nation share everyday online — would dangerously stifle free expression among the very young people whom schools are supposed to teach that value. Who, then, should win the case? Happily, the answer is not as important as one might expect given the gravity of the conflict. The reason is that whoever loses on the technical legal question — whether Tinker applies to off-campus speech — should still enjoy a meaningful strategy for protecting their interests moving forward. The key is for the Supreme Court to say so in any opinion it writes. Start with a ruling against Levy. If the Supreme Court holds that school districts can, in fact, punish students for off-campus speech that meets Tinker""s substantial disruption standard, that is not the end of Levy""s case. She can (and should) still prevail if her snap did not actually create such a disruption. As it turns out, the district court ruled in her favor on exactly this basis. Apart from a few comments from upset students — precisely the kind of reaction generated by the protests in Tinker — Levy""s snap caused no disruptive effect in school. Or consider a possible ruling against the school district. If the court wishes to protect the expressive interests of young people like Levy, it can affirm that Tinker has no application to off-campus speech. But if it does that, it can (and should) also make clear that schools retain the power to punish students for off-campus speech that threatens, bullies or harasses others because such speech is not protected under standard First Amendment principles. Tellingly, Levy agrees. As her brief puts it, ""Ordinary First Amendment standards … already permit schools to regulate harassment and bullying, including when they are carried out by speech."" The outcome of Supreme Court rulings on major societal conflicts can feel like a matter of life or death, so battles over the Supreme Court often feel the same way. That is especially true in this polarized moment. But a case like Mahanoy Area School District shows why it is important to look beyond the court and focus on what happens after the court issues its decisions. Sometimes, the side that loses a monumental case will still have meaningful options for avoiding harm. Indeed, I""ve argued that the Supreme Court is increasingly deciding hard cases with this important idea in mind: A number of its recent opinions have reminded losing litigants of their other avenues for redress. By signaling the availability of these post-defeat responses, the court ensures that its decisions avoid all-out losers. The court should continue on this promising path, both in Mahanoy and the other cases on its docket. Aaron Tang is a law professor at the University of California, Davis.

usa_today|"The emotional three-week trial of Derek Chauvin came to an end April 20 when the former Minneapolis police officer was found guilty of murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died while being restrained by Chauvin in police custody. The May 25, 2020, video of a handcuffed Floyd lying prone on the ground as Chauvin, a white 19-year police veteran, pressed a knee against Floyd's neck sparked massive Black Lives Matter protests across the U.S. and the rest of the world. The summer of 2020 saw some of these protests in cities such as Portland marred by violence, property destruction and clashes with police and counter-protesters. The city of Minneapolis and several others prepared for a potential repeat of the summer's unrest as the Chauvin trial neared its conclusion. But one viral Instagram video claims before the verdict that an incident had already happened, and it lays the blame on BLM and antifa. ""Black Lives Matter and antifa set Catholic church on fire in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Domestic terrorism in American streets,"" declares text displayed over a video of a burning building. Fact check:Missing context in claim about Black Lives Matter co-founder's property purchases The video, shared on April 20 by an account called republicanparty, which describes itself as ""Your #1 source for Republican news,"" cites another Instagram account associated with an Evan Kilgore as the original source. The text post accompanying the video claims this fire is a ""preview for what is to come after the Chauvin verdict"" and warns that ""not even churches are safe from the mob in Minneapolis."" We found the video is authentic, but the fire did not happen as republicanparty or Evan Kilgore claims it did. USA TODAY has reached out to the posters for further comment. According to the Minneapolis Fire Department, firefighters responded to a fire at the Sacred Heart of Jesus parish in northeast Minneapolis just before 7 p.m. on April 19, a day before Chauvin's verdict was announced. Heavy fire and damage within the century-old, two-story Polish National Catholic church forced firefighters to control the flames from the outside, reported the Star Tribune. Aerial shots of the fire, as seen in the Instagram video, were captured by other local  news outlets. While the cause of the fire is still under investigation by the fire department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, links to potential civil unrest have been dismissed. ""There (are) no indications that the fire is associated with any civil unrest at this time,"" Melanie Rucker, assistant chief of administration and the public information officer for the Minneapolis Fire Department, told The Catholic Spirit. Fact check:Arrest video, autopsy contradict claim that George Floyd's death was staged In an email to USA TODAY, the ATF declined to provide any further comment, deferring instead to the Minneapolis Fire Department, who USA TODAY has also reached out to for comment. Speaking to a local ABC News affiliate, Minneapolis Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said there were people inside the church when responders arrived on scene, but they were safely evacuated. No injuries or causalities were reported. Much of the blaze was put out by around 10 p.m., the department stated on Twitter. We rate the claim the Black Lives Matter and antifa movements were responsible for the burning of a Minneapolis church FALSE, based on our research. A Catholic church in northeast Minneapolis did catch fire on April 19 – a day before the Chauvin trial reached a verdict – and experienced heavy damage.

usa_today|"LOS ANGELES — A former president of the organization that hosts the Golden Globes has been dropped from the group's board after sending an email that called Black Lives Matter a ""hate movement."" The Hollywood Foreign Press Association board said in an email Tuesday that Phil Berk is no longer a member of the organization. The decision comes hours after NBC — which telecasts the Globes — condemned Berk's actions and called for his ""immediate expulsion."" The show's producer, dick clark productions, also demanded for Berk's removal. Berk, an eight-term association president, fell under heavy scrutiny after he sent an email Sunday criticizing Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors. The South African-born Berk shared an article that called Black Lives Matter a ""racist hate movement"" and described Cullors as a ""self-proclaimed trained Marxist,"" according to a report from the Los Angeles Times. The email was sent to HFPA members, staff and the group's general counsel and chief operating officer. Berk had been a member of the organization for more than 40 years. Shaun Harper, who was hired as a diversity strategist advisor by the HFPA last month, said in a resignation letter that he was initially optimistic when he joined the organization, but he felt compelled to step down after learning about the group's ""deep systemic and reputational challenges.""

usa_today|"We saw it on social media after George Floyd's death last summer, after Derek Chauvin's guilty verdict last week and during the many Black deaths in between: ""Check in on your Black friends."" For Black people, ""how are you?"" can be a loaded question. A too-small phrase asked in spaces that can rarely accommodate the answer. When Chauvin was found guilty, there was exhalation and in some cases celebration, but there was also unrelenting grief. There was recognition among Black Americans of what the moment offered, and what it still denied. About 20 minutes before the verdict was announced, a 16-year-old Black girl, Ma""Khia Bryant, was fatally shot by police in Columbus, Ohio. Breonna Taylor has been gone a year:Why we need to talk more about the racial trauma of Black death On social media, some Black people said they appreciate it when white friends and colleagues check in. Others said there is nothing they want less. Some non-Black people might not be sure what to say. ""There's no one-size-fits-all response to racial trauma,"" said Brandon J. Johnson, creator of The Black Mental Wellness Lounge YouTube page. ""There's no one-size-fits-all approach to how to support others in these moments where we have these complex emotions based on our individual experiences."" There are distinctions: a difference between checking in with a close friend, and someone you haven't spoken to in a decade. A difference between checking in to offer support and checking in just to say you did. There's a difference between telling someone you love them, and seeking answers to impossible questions. Analysis:'Imagine saying to a room full of Black people: It's too hard for me to watch that trial' ""There is no one way to reach out and say, 'Hey, I'm attending to your trauma,'"" said Sharnise Hendrick, a therapist who specializes in racial trauma. ""How would you reach out to somebody you love knowing that they lost someone? Because that's what's happening. We're losing ourselves. We're losing members of our community. We're losing people that look like us. We are holding our breath, most recently for a year, to see whether the outcome in this trial was going to confirm what our eyes already told us."" Experts in racial trauma say the spectrum of reactions to ""reach out to your Black friends"" underscores the diversity of experiences among Black people as well as the particulars of their relationships to non-Black people in their lives. ""We're not a monolith,"" said Alisha Moreland-Capuia, director of trauma-informed treatment, consultation, and outreach at the Center of Excellence in Depression and Anxiety Disorders at McLean Hospital in Massachusetts. ""Not everybody requires the same thing. However, as a system, as a people, it's important to acknowledge that something happened, and to think, 'How might we be helpful? How should we proceed?'"" How to proceed depends on who you're reaching out to and what they need. Before you reach out to a Black person in your life, especially after a high-profile incident of racial violence, consider your relationship and your motivations. How often do you speak to this person? Are you reaching out because you saw online that a good anti-racist person reaches out? Or are reaching out because you care about someone in your life who's suffering? ""I have had people who I haven't talked to in five years message me. Especially last year when all of the protests were really starting up,"" said Dechelle Brooks, 26, a writer in Sacramento, California. ""It was weird to have somebody who I don't really have a relationship with anymore … reach out and make me relive this trauma because they don't know how to talk to me because they don't know me. It feels performative."" JaLoni Owens, 22, a student at City University of New York School of Law, said the omnipresence of racial violence can lead some white people to believe they understand the experience of racial trauma more intimately than is possible. 'When you see, 'check in on your Black friends,' you're like, 'well, every Black person I know is my Black friend. I'm nice to all the Black people in my life. I have a friendly relationship with all the Black people in my workplace. So all the Black people are my friends. Therefore, they all must want this from me and expect this from me.' When that's not necessarily the case,"" Owens said. ""That overfamiliarity, I think, leads to a lot more invasive questions; versus just like a 'hi, how are you?' It becomes, 'oh, I saw this lynching yesterday and wanted to check in on you.' That can be really overwhelming."" Johnson said it can be helpful to have a conversation with someone you care about ahead of a crisis, where you ask, ""What is the best way for me to support you?"" or ""What is the best way for me to be with you?"" Some people may want to be asked how they are, while others will find the question frustrating. Some people will want check-ins that don't require a response. Some people may only want to convene with those who share their racial identity. Johnson said after someone tells you what they want, listen to them. Don't assume you know better, he said. Don't try to center your own emotions. Moreland-Capuia said well-intentioned people will not always get this right. If you're reaching out to a Black friend for the right reasons, the hope is that there can be honest dialogue even if your effort to show support doesn't end up being what that person wants or needs. ""People know when there is a firm, genuine, sincere commitment,"" she said. ""You are going to miss the mark sometimes. What you do with that is, 'OK. I didn't quite meet the mark at that particular instance, and I'm going to keep trying. I'm going to learn and figure out what I need to do,' because there's a commitment to contributing to a healing environment."" Many Black people also say rather than a ""check-in,"" they would prefer purported white allies engage in anti-racism work, whether donating money, volunteering in their communities, or educating other white people. ""I think the best way to show support is to work alongside us throughout the other 364 days of the year to dismantle systemic racism in the country,"" Johnson said. Black people say they need to feel valued and respected, to know what they have seen and felt is important and real. ""Holding space means that we are bearing witness to the emotional turmoil, to the vacillating feelings and emotions, to the uncertainty that this other person is sharing without asking them to put that into a coherent sentence,"" Hendrick said. When her non-Black friends reach out, Brooks said she appreciates gentle, non-explicit check-ins. She doesn't want a litany of texts rehashing details of violence. ""That's making us relive it and you don't always know what someone's mental state is at the moment,"" she said. ""Just a simple, 'Is there anything I can do to support you right now? Do you want to talk about anything?' I think that does wonders for a lot of people. And again, it's not for everyone, but for me, it's nice to know that people are thinking about me when something like this happens."" Johnson said he had many conversations about the Chauvin verdict and next steps with Black friends and family. He didn't receive any messages Tuesday from his non-Black friends, and he was comfortable with that. ""Those moments after the verdict were centered on us and our community,"" he said. ""My non-Black colleagues made sure not to center themselves in that moment and that response works well for me."" Owens, who does social justice organizing on and off campus, said they had a couple of friends reach out after the verdict in ways they welcomed. ""It came from a place of, 'I see you constantly doing a lot of labor, no matter what is happening in the world,'"" Owens said. ""One of them was like, 'Hey, I'm going to Venmo you $5 to get yourself a coffee today because I know that perhaps if I don't, you may go without nourishment.' It was just saying, 'Hey, like, I see you and I have this space for you, if you need to take it up.'"""
