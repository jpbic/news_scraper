daily_wire|"""Saturday Night Live"" has been uber-liberal for its entire existence, often to the point where it simply isn""t funny anymore. When Joe Biden became president, the long-running late-night comedy show didn""t hit him for months, and even then the ribbing was light-hearted – a far cry from how the show treated former President Donald Trump. But SNL on Saturday did hit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for its ever-evolving mask guidance and took aim at the top immunologist in the U.S., Dr. Anthony Fauci. In the show""s cold open, cast member Kate McKinnon played Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) who served on Trump""s White House Coronavirus Task Force and is now Biden""s chief medical adviser on COVID-19. ""It""s your boy, Fauci, the patron saint of Purell,"" said McKinnon, wearing fake ears and speaking in Fauci""s trademark gravelly voice. ""The CDC announced that people that are vaccinated no longer need to wear masks, outdoors or indoors. Pretty great, right?"" McKinnon said. But ""a lot of people had questions, such as, ""what does that mean? What the hell are you talking about? Is this a trap?"""" The fake Fauci then said he""d found a few doctors who minored in theater to act out various scenarios to help clear up the confusion. In the first scene, a couple pretended to be in a bar. Cast members Beck Bennett told Aidy Bryant that the fact that he is ""entering a bar at 11 a.m."" should be proof that he is not ""vaxxed."" BRYANT: Welcome to a bar. BENNETT: Thank you. Do I still have to wear a mask indoors? BRYANT: You actually do not. BENNETT: Great. BRYANT: Well, as long as you""re vaccinated. BENNETT: No, I""m not. BRYANT: Oh, then that""s bad. BENNETT: Well I""m entering a bar at 11 a.m., did you really think I was vaxxed, because that""s on you. BRYANT: Right, I deserve COVID. BENNETT: And … scene. McKinnon said that message wasn""t right, adding that ""we have to trust each other."" In the next scenario, Bowen Yang played an airline passenger who is told he will still have to wear a mask when not eating or drinking. He moved on quickly, saying he has been inside for a year. He then asked the flight attendant if she would like to ""bang,"" telling her to ""Hop on, let""s go for a real ride."" McKinnon took issue with that message too, saying, ""the lesson should have been, you need masks on planes. Not, everybody horny now."" After a few more scenes, the last one featured a group of people dancing together. As they celebrated, Bennett ended the fun by saying, ""Now, let""s talk about Israel."" ""That seems like a good place to end,"" McKinnon said. ""So, in summary, please everyone get the vaccine and enjoy life with no masks.""

daily_wire|"President Biden on Friday revoked former President Trump""s executive order from May 2020 targeting online censorship. Trump wanted interactive computer services such as  Twitter, Facebook, and Google, among others, to be held responsible for content posted to their platforms. In Trump""s Executive Order 13925 of May 28, 2020, he wrote that the policy of the United States should be that ""an internet provider be exposed to liability like any traditional editor and publisher that is not an online provider."" Trump specifically addressed Section 230 of the U.S. Code, which states : No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account ofany action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected. The term ""otherwise objectionable"" has given license to sites such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter to censor material they find ""otherwise objectionable."" Last October, Google""s CEO, Sundar Pichai, spoke before Congress and claimed , ""Of course, our ability to provide access to a wide range of information is only possible because of existing legal frameworks, like Section 230. The United States adopted Section 230 early in the internet""s history, and it has been foundational to US leadership in the tech sector. Section 230 protects the freedom to create and share content while supporting the ability of platforms and services of all sizes to responsibly address harmful content."" Trump wrote in his executive order: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see. … Section 230(c) was designed to address early court decisions holding that, if an online platform restricted access to some content posted by others, it would thereby become a ""publisher"" of all the content posted on its site for purposes of torts such as defamation. As the title of section 230(c) makes clear, the provision provides limited liability ""protection"" to a provider of an interactive computer service (such as an online platform) that engages in """"Good Samaritan"" blocking"" of harmful content. In particular, the Congress sought to provide protections for online platforms that attempted to protect minors from harmful content and intended to ensure that such providers would not be discouraged from taking down harmful material. The provision was also intended to further the express vision of the Congress that the internet is a ""forum for a true diversity of political discourse.""  The limited protections provided by the statute should be construed with these purposes in mind. … In particular, subparagraph (c)(2) expressly addresses protections from ""civil liability"" and specifies that an interactive computer service provider may not be made liable ""on account of"" its decision in ""good faith"" to restrict access to content that it considers to be ""obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing or otherwise objectionable."" It is the policy of the United States to ensure that, to the maximum extent permissible under the law, this provision is not distorted to provide liability protection for online platforms that—far from acting in ""good faith"" to remove objectionable content—instead engage in deceptive or pretextual actions (often contrary to their stated terms of service) to stifle viewpoints with which they disagree. … Section 230 was not intended to allow a handful of companies to grow into titans controlling vital avenues for our national discourse under the guise of promoting open forums for debate, and then to provide those behemoths blanket immunity when they use their power to censor content and silence viewpoints that they dislike. When an interactive computer service provider removes or restricts access to content and its actions do not meet the criteria of subparagraph (c)(2)(A), it is engaged in editorial conduct. It is the policy of the United States that such a provider should properly lose the limited liability shield of subparagraph (c)(2)(A) and be exposed to liability like any traditional editor and publisher that is not an online provider.

daily_wire|"CNN has changed dramatically since it went on the air in 1980. Back then, it covered news. The Washington Post seems to labor under the delusion that it still does. In what was presented as a hard news story, the paper claimed that CNN only recently abandoned cable news"" ""industry-wide standards of impartiality"" to become more ""authentic."" Reporter Jeremy Barr shoehorned that assumption into the headline, ""The new CNN is more opinionated and emotional. Can it still be ""the most trusted name in news?"""" Under network president Jeff Zucker, CNN""s once studiously neutral team now call out politicians, share their feelings and occasionally cry on air. It doesn""t seem to hurt ratings. https://t.co/RCTBBnyxV3 — The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) May 12, 2021 Applying the same level of sophistication and misguided assumptions could produce a question like, ""Santa Claus has gained so much weight. Can he still make it around the world in one night?"" Yet Barr, boasted online, ""I spent about two months tracing the evolution of CNN over the last two decades, talking with anchors from different eras and finally speaking with network president Jeff Zucker about encouraging his on-air personalities to be more ""real"" and ""human."""" I spent about two months tracing the evolution of CNN over the last two decades, talking with anchors from different eras and finally speaking with network president Jeff Zucker about encouraging his on-air personalities to be more ""real"" and ""human."" https://t.co/TOHPt5bIgc — Jeremy Barr (@jeremymbarr) May 12, 2021 Barr admitted that he couldn""t find any ""obvious moment when CNN pivoted away from"" its alleged ""studiously neutral impartiality."" But ultimately, he traced CNN""s change to the beginning of Jeffrey Zucker""s tenure with the company … in 2012. Zucker let the anchors begin crying and exclaiming profanity on the air. True, Barr confessed , ""to some ears, and during some stories, CNN""s new emotional rawness can sound like bias."" But, he concluded, you can""t argue with success. ""While some viewers may miss the old strait-laced, just-the-facts CNN, the new strategy seems to be working,"" Barr wrote. ""In 2020, an extremely newsy year, it attracted its largest audience in its 40-year history."" Actually, Barr blew the most verifiable fact of the story: CNN""s largest audience came in January 2021. Is he right that viewers rewarded CNN for shedding its pretense of objectivity and embracing the anchors"" ""authenticity?"" For that matter, was CNN ever ""the most trusted name in news?"" Like most subjects, which news source the public trusts depends on which public you ask. A YouGov poll last June found the majority (57%) of Republicans trusted only one news outlet: Fox News. Other media that posted respectable numbers include the Wall Street Journal and One America News Network (OANN). Rounding out the bottom were The Washington Post, CNN, and MSNBC, trusted by about one in ten conservatives. But among Democrats, The Washington Post, CNN, and The New York Times held a virtual three-way tie for first place, followed closely by MSNBC and the Wall Street Journal. So, Barr didn""t misstate the facts; he just told us that he""s a Democrat — which should have been clear based on his position as a reporter for The Washington Post. But Barr reads CNN""s ratings history backwards. During its heyday as a putatively down-the-middle news organization, CNN ruled the airwaves as the first 24-hour cable news channel. The pioneering experiment was so successful that, two years later, it spawned Headline News. But while CNN""s transmogrification into a shrill, hyper-partisan mouthpiece went into overdrive during the Trump years, it had been set in motion virtually from the outset by its Leftist founder, Ted Turner. CNN regularly whitewashed totalitarians and terrorists. During her stint at CNN, Connie Chung noted that the Islamic terrorist group Hamas preferred to be called ""freedom fighters."" Similarly, CNN insisted in 2002 that Fidel Castro had made Cuba a "" success "" where ""everyone has access"" to healthcare. In reality, it was (and is) a racist, repressive, Marxist state where ""the best clinics and hospitals only served political elites"" and basic medicines like aspirin and antibiotics can only be had on the black market. The network""s domestic coverage was also so biased that, by 1992, conservatives dubbed CNN the ""Clinton News Network."" During the that year""s Democratic National Convention, CNN didn""t label a single speaker "" far-Left "" — including former California Governor Jerry Brown and his assistant/donor Jodie Evans , who once asked , ""Why is being a Communist anti-American?"" But at the Republican convention in Houston, CNN described ex-Education Secretary and Drug Czar William J. Bennett — a former Democrat and lifelong civil rights advocate — a ""very hard, far-Right conservative."" Over the years, CNN — like the rest of the legacy media — simply grew more comfortable shedding the pretense of objectivity, professionalism, and civility. Witness Don Lemon, who laughed himself to tears as his guests called the 63 million Americans who voted for Donald Trump credulous rubes who can""t spell. Or Christiane Amanpour, who compared the Trump administration to a four-year-long Kristallnacht . It""s true that Jeffrey Zucker had a heavy hand in its transformation, but it""s not clear how much of these performances are ""authentic."" Undercover footage released by Project Veritas shows Zucker setting the day""s news agenda, telling reporters what to cover and how to cover it. ""Stay very focused on impeachment,"" he said . "" Lean into "" the idea that Donald Trump ""maybe is on the after-effects of steroids."" True, CNN had the best month of its existence in January 2021 — because it struck gold on a single day: January 6. Its saturation coverage of the Capitol riot drew a reported 5.2 million viewers, the largest audience in its 41-year history. For once, it outperformed Fox News. But CNN""s modest collection of ratings victories — "" one in a row "" — follows a losing streak rivaled only by the Washington Generals . Fox News administered a continuous drubbing in the ratings boxes of Nielsen families coast to coast for 19 straight years . Even its slogan, ""Fair and Balanced,"" resonated with viewers long conscious of CNN""s bias. Shortly after 9/11, FNC overtook CNN in the ratings and never looked back, as this chart from the Pew Research Center illustrates. By 2019, when Fox News and MSNBC rated as the top two networks on basic cable, CNN came in fourteenth — behind TLC, A&E, and Investigation Discovery, and just a notch ahead of the Food Network. And the network""s brief moment in the sun came to an abrupt end after January 20, when CNN lost its greatest foil and gained a ratings albatross named Joe Biden . CNN""s audience collapsed from 1.2 million viewers a day to 749,000 by late April. Last Friday, not a single CNN show attracted 900,000 viewers. With another seven months of success like that, CNN won""t exist at all. But its journalistic integrity died long ago. Ben Johnson is the Media Reporter at The Daily Wire.

daily_wire|"Republican Rep. Liz Cheney is out as Republican conference chair in the House of Representatives. The story has dominated American news outlets over the past week. Most Americans are probably hard-pressed to care about the story, but to the political press in the United States, the story has mattered deeply. This past Tuesday night, as rockets rained down on Tel Aviv from Gaza, the press was focused on Cheney""s pending ouster, which happened Wednesday morning. On Wednesday afternoon, while President Joe Biden was holding a press conference about the Colonial Pipeline shutdown, MSNBC was holding a panel discussion about Cheney and the future of the Republican Party. Chris Cillizza, CNN""s regurgitator of convention hot takes, wrote, ""The maneuvering to get Cheney out on Wednesday bodes very poorly for House Republicans."" One would think the House GOP conference chair was an important position. It is not. One would assume Americans care. They do not. To understand the salacious, constant coverage of Cheney by the press, we must venture across the Atlantic to Great Britain and consider an essay by former Prime Minister Tony Blair on the collapse of the global progressive movement generally and his Labour Party in particular. Writing in the New Statesman, Blair notes that Biden won not because of some sweeping progressive agenda but because former President Donald Trump was ""considered by centre-ground voters to be uniquely strange and unacceptable in his behaviour. … Without Biden, and his self-evident reasonableness and moderation, there might have been no victory."" Blair noted the Republican Party could make a comeback while many American pundits are yet again predicting the end of the Republican Party — a prediction made biennially by the press. In doing so, Blair wrote, ""It could be that the domination of the Republican Party by the continuing division over Donald Trump eclipses any opportunity for a revival, at least for the presidency; but should the Republicans resolve their leadership crisis and identify a viable leader, they could give the Democrats a run for their money."" Therein lies the reason for the press""s obsession with Liz Cheney. In the absence of the press""s obsessive coverage, they might have to focus on the calamitous effects of the first five months of the Biden presidency. The border is overrun with illegal aliens. Inflation is on the rise above initial Federal Reserve estimates. The number of available jobs in the private sector grows as unemployment increases. The free market, it turns out, cannot compete against the government using taxpayer dollars to subsidize unemployment. There are gas lines and energy price increases. As the humor site The Babylon Bee headlines, ""Biden Continues Rollback of Trump Policies Like Peace In The Middle East."" There is also a crime wave in major urban and suburban areas around the country. Beyond those, the Left""s cancel culture and woke politics continue with reckless abandon. Journalist Christopher Rufo uncovered the Walt Disney Corporation sending employees into left-wing diversity training that claimed the United States had a ""long history of systemic racism and transphobia."" The Biden administration is advancing abortion rules that would yet again force Christian organizations to pay for abortions. The Department of Education is advancing rules that embrace the revisionist and historically counterfactual ""1619 Project"" from The New York Times. Some Democrats continue to demand police departments be defunded. The federal government continues to undermine its message on vaccines, engages in lectures on mask mandates contrary to what the science suggests, and has let left-wing teachers unions hold school reopenings hostage, even as parents demand their kids return to school. As Blair notes in his essay, ""Today progressive politics has an old-fashioned economic message of Big State, tax and spend which, other than the spending part (which the right can do anyway), is not particularly attractive. This is combined with a new-fashioned social/cultural message around extreme identity and anti-police politics which, for large swathes of people, is voter-repellent."" Given the current state of affairs, the press has concluded it is better to amplify supposed divisions in the GOP as a way to turn off voters than cover what filled the American power vacuum in the absence of Donald Trump.

daily_wire|"The front page of the May 13 Washington Times was sobering. ""President Biden""s second 100 days are off to a woeful start, including a gas shortage for much of the East Coast, a surge of inflation, a slowdown in hiring despite a record number of job openings, renewed fighting in the Middle East and an unresolved border crisis,"" it read. But the rest of the news media? They""re obsessing over how terrible (and terribly split) the Republicans are. One party is engaged in a ""civil war,"" and the other is forever portrayed as a placid pool of calm. This is how you know the ""news"" today is whatever narrative the Biden-coddling ""mainstream"" media decide to adopt. They""re never going to sound like Ted Cruz, who says, ""Biden policies are failing across the board: economically, domestically and abroad."" They""re going to sound like humanoid robots programmed by White House press secretary Jen Psaki. It""s not even entertaining to imagine how the media would cover these developments if Donald Trump were president. He would be blamed for all this. But it""s also safe to assume they would be doing a large chunk of what they""re doing now: obsessing over the dangerous Republican Party, championing the protests of Rep. Liz Cheney, wallowing in ""new"" footage of the dreadful Jan. 6 riot. The media pretend that they exist to moderate our democracy and hold public servants accountable and explain complicated policy matters. Instead, they focus on food fights and clickbait and exacerbating the nastiness of social media. Curtis Houck of the Media Research Center studied CNN coverage for 12 hours on May 12 and found that the network spent 151 minutes obsessing over Cheney""s ouster and only 55 minutes and change on multiple mounting economic problems in the country. That""s almost a 3-to-1 disparity. The government reported that 178,622 immigrants were apprehended at the southwest border region in April, an increase from the then-record-breaking 173,348 in March. But even as the surge went up 3%, Media Research Center""s Rich Noyes found that the ABC, CBS and NBC evening-news program coverage of this issue dropped dramatically from March to April, by 61%. But it""s worse than just numbers. ""President Biden and his policies were completely shielded from blame in a majority (48) of the 88 stories aired during these two months, as less than one-third (26) included any reference by the reporter that the surge had anything to do with Biden,"" Noyes wrote. In preparation for the president""s 100th day in office, CBS News polled just over 2,500 adults. Among major issues in the survey, the public""s worst reviews (57% disapproval) were given to Biden""s border bungling. CBS helpfully excluded that negative number from its broadcast reporting. The networks have this persistent habit of reporting the poll numbers they like and burying those they don""t. During Biden""s only press conference of his presidency, instead of tough questioning, reporters such as Yamiche Alcindor of PBS buttered him up, saying, ""the perception of you that got you elected — as a moral, decent man — is the reason why a lot of immigrants are coming to this country."" Biden told his PBS publicity helper he ""should be flattered"" by the six-figure immigrant surge. The media repeat after Psaki that this is not a ""border crisis""; it is merely a ""challenge."" She sounds like Psaki Poppins, urging the press to take a spoonful of sugar to help the liberal medicine go down. The nanny makes us feel vaguely sickened. The wheels are coming off this country, and the journalists are in denial. The views expressed in this piece are the author""s own and do not necessarily represent those of The Daily Wire.

daily_wire|"When MSNBC host Joy Reid asked her guest for an explanation of the Israeli-Gaza conflict, the Palestinian expert replied, ""Jewish supremacy."" Yet Reid offered no pushback during the closing segment of Friday""s edition of ""The ReidOut."" Reid introduced her guest as ""my friend Rula Jebreal, who is a foreign policy analyst and visiting professor at the University of Miami."" Jebreal""s comments came after Mohammed El-Kurd, who was evicted from his home in Jerusalem""s Sheikh-Jarrah neighborhood, called the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) the ""Israeli terrorist forces"" and likened them to ""fascists."" ""Rula, can you just sort us give us a bigger picture explanation of what""s happening here?"" asked Reid, noting that the term evictions ""doesn""t feel like it""s the right word for it."" ""Jewish supremacy is the main goal of Israel sic apartheid government,"" Jebreal replied. ""We are already living a project of ethno-religious exclusion and purity."" ""The occupation is metastasized everywhere,"" she continued, later adding: ""And the most heartbreaking thing, Joy, is that the United States subsidized this ethno-nationalist project of exclusion and purity. We subsidized the atrocities that are taking place."" She also claimed that current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""incited against"" former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated. ""He was killed by Jewish extremists. Today, these Jewish extremists are in parliament. They""re legislating,"" Jebreal said. ""Now we have this supremacist movement everywhere spreading, in the judiciary and everywhere."" Jebreal also seemingly tried to equate Israeli government policy with white supremacy, the U.S. Border Patrol, and the Capitol riot of January 6. ""What you are seeing, Joy, is what we""ve seen here in America with these white supremacists under Jim Crow,"" Jebreal said, later adding: ""We""ve seen this force, whether in January 6. We""ve seen this kind of politics when they put kids in cages in the United States."" Her attempt to tie her political opponents to white supremacists seems ironic since her words echo the most widely exposed white nationalist in modern U.S. history, David Duke . The former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan literally wrote a book titled Jewish Supremacism ; chapter nine is titled, ""Israel: A supremacist state."" In it, Duke wrote : My assertion that there exists a powerful, cohesive, world-wide Jewish Supremacism finds confirmation in evidence mostly provided by the Jewish Supremacists themselves. Their supremacist ideology finds clear enunciation in the foundation, structure and conduct of Israel, a nation unabashedly based on an ethnic supremacism. It is a state that has dispossessed, terrorized and grossly violated the human and civil rights of the Palestinian people. Duke has been a longtime critic of Israel and a supporter of the Palestinian cause. He said on his podcast Wednesday  that ""for Israel to get away with this, kind of shows, truly, the Jewish supremacy that exists in the media."" Jebreal concluded by erroneously linking Benjamin Netanyahu with the January 6 ""insurrection."" ""The radicalization in Israel, it""s actually coming here,"" she warned Reid and her MSNBC audience. ""The main newspaper editor-in-chief, Israel Hayom, he was Bibi Netanyahu""s — somehow surrogate. Guess what? He was at the January 6 insurrection."" It""s unclear what she means: Israel has an influential newspaper called Israel Hayom, but this author was unable to find any reference to any staffer being present at the riot. Jebreal appears to be referring to Elliot Resnick, the Brooklyn-based chief editor of The Jewish Press, who attended the event. (He has not been charged with any crime.) But this author has found no evidence that Resnick ever served as a spokesman for Prime Minister Netanyahu. MSNBC posted a portion of the segment (which followed Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg""s interview earlier in the hour) on YouTube — but they ended the clip just before Jebreal""s incendiary comments. A partial transcript of their exchange follows : Joy Reid: Rula, can you just sort us give us a bigger picture explanation of what""s happening here? Because what are being called evictions, it doesn""t feel like it""s the right word for it. What is happening in terms of the homes that people like Mohammed El-Kurd have in East Jerusalem? Rula Jebreal: So, Jewish supremacy is the main goal of Israel apartheid government. And I say the word apartheid because the former prime minister of Israel — two of them — Ehud Olmert, Ehud Barak, security services, the head of the Mossad, and many others use this word, saying, in absence of any political solution, we will be entering apartheid. We are already living a project of ethno-religious exclusion and purity. This is what happened after years of Bibi Netanyahu incitement, weaponization of religion, and weaponization of race, where it doesn""t matter — democracy for even Palestinian who live inside. What matter is their ethnicity, what matter is their race, their religion. And it""s basically this stage where the occupation is metastasized everywhere, not only in Gaza or in the West Bank or East Jerusalem, but also inside Israel. What you are seeing, Joy, is what we""ve seen here in America with these white supremacists under Jim Crow. … We""ve seen this force, whether in January 6. We""ve seen this kind of politics when they put kids in cages in the United States. We""ve seen this before. And the most heartbreaking thing, Joy, is that the United States subsidized this ethno-nationalist project of exclusion and purity. We subsidized the atrocities that are taking place. Reid: Let me ask you this, because it feels like this is sort of the endless, never-ending conflict. … There""s been this talk of a two-state solution forever and ever and ever and ever. It doesn""t feel like it""s going that way. Bigger picture, Rula, is that dead?… Is that dead as an idea? Jebreal: Netanyahu killed it. … Netanyahu incited against Rabin, and he was killed by Jewish extremists. Today, these Jewish extremists are in parliament. They""re legislating. Now we have this supremacist movement everywhere spreading, in the judiciary and everywhere. Not only it""s dead, it""s buried. The reality on the ground is that we have a one-state reality. And what you""re seeing is the consequence of a lack, an absence of any political solution. Netanyahu doesn""t want a political solution. Not only that, he wants not only to wage a war on democracy and exterminate Palestinians, he wants to come back and tell Joe Biden, ""Don""t interfere in my business."" But he""s willing to come here and lobby Congress against any signature policy. And he""s willing — and one of the things we didn""t pay attention to: The radicalization in Israel, it""s actually coming here. The main newspaper editor-in-chief, Israel Hayom, he was Bibi Netanyahu""s somehow surrogate. Guess what? He was at the January 6 insurrection. What happened there, the authoritarianism and what Mohammed El-Kurd called ""fascist,"" it""s coming back here. So, if we stand for democracy, it""s not only in the United States.

daily_wire|"Riddle me this: Why would Republicans fall for the Democrats"" age-old ploy of pressuring them into working on ""bipartisan"" legislation that will only advance the Democratic agenda and damage the nation? Indeed, what""s the point in the GOP puffing up its chest about ousting Liz Cheney from her House leadership position if they""re just going to turn around and behave like never-Trumpers by caving on President Biden""s agenda? Why would they play footsy with the most militantly leftist party in American history? That can""t possibly be good for America, nor can it be good for their political fortunes, as voters don""t want them to be spineless wimps. Republicans need to do more than just talk. They must summon all of their power to block Biden""s disastrous agenda — not for the sake of partisan obstructionism but for the sake of the nation. People likely to vote for Republicans don""t elect their representatives to engage in self-congratulatory bipartisan soirees; they elect them to advance beneficial policies and thwart destructive ones. They mustn""t appease the cancel culture mobs. The Left will demonize Republicans no matter what they do and no matter whether they rally around former President Donald Trump, so how about they just do what is right and aggressively pursue their supporters"" policy preferences? Why am I bringing all this up? Well, because several recent news stories describe Biden""s meeting with congressional leaders over the so-called ""infrastructure"" bill. My alarms went off when I read that Biden was ""encouraged"" about the deal after meeting with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Given Biden""s radical agenda, his encouragement means my discouragement — unless he is misreading or being deceptive about McConnell and McCarthy""s position. Biden said: ""But I want to make it clear to you: I""m encouraged not just because of one solid meeting with the Republican leader in the House and with Sen. McConnell. … I""ve been meeting with bipartisan leaders for a long time now. So, generically, I""m encouraged that there""s room to have a compromise on a bipartisan bill that""s solid and significant and a means by which to pay for it without dropping all of the burden on middle class and working-class people."" By that, Biden surely means he senses Republicans might be open to his intention to pay for the bill through a hike in the corporate tax rate. Biden wants to repeal Trump""s corporate tax rate cut, which put America more in line with the rest of the advanced world and helped spur economic growth. But corporate tax increases pass through to individual taxpayers. It""s false that the wealthy pay less than the middle class. Biden""s schemes will further retard economic growth, which will disproportionately harm the middle class and the poor. So I""m not particularly thrilled with Republicans kowtowing to this demagoguery just to appear bipartisan. Let""s review some other Biden statements that illustrate his professed commitment to bipartisanship is disingenuous. In an MSNBC interview, he said: ""I want to get a bipartisan deal on as much as we can get a bipartisan deal on. … I""m not going to give up on a whole range of things that go to the question of productivity, of increasing jobs, increasing employment, increasing revenues. I""m not willing to give up on that. So we""re going to fight those out. … Let""s see if we can get an agreement to kick-start this and then fight over what""s left and see if I can get it done without Republicans if need be."" Do you hear him? Don""t start demanding bipartisanship from Republicans when the Democratic president is openly admitting he only intends to be bipartisan on those matters on which Republicans will agree. He expects Republicans to cave on many items, and on all others, he""ll railroad them right through via the reconciliation process. He has shown no willingness to compromise his positions. What a great deal for Biden — ""Heads I win. Tails you lose."" Making matters worse, all of Biden""s proposed solutions are backasswards. You don""t increase productivity and jobs by injecting play money into the economy and continuing to pay unemployment benefits that disincentivize people from returning to work, a reality he cynically denies. A watchdog press would be lambasting Biden for his partisanship, not cajoling Republicans to be bipartisan in the face of such an uncompromising president. But that""s a fantasy. We are already witnessing the poisonous fruits of Biden""s programs: inflation; an overrun border that threatens America""s sovereignty and security; a constant stirring of racial resentment; foreign policy weakness and a betrayal of our ally Israel; gas hikes partially caused by a war on domestic energy; a war on cops; a war on free, fair, and honest elections; a perversion of our national security by preposterously identifying white supremacy as the greatest security threat; a weakened military obsessed with identity politics; a never-ending climate of fear over the pandemic that keeps schools and businesses shut down; rampant cancel culture; and our academic, cultural and digital institutions suppressing speech, demanding conformity, and smothering academic inquiry. Note to Republicans: Don""t fall for this sham for the thousandth time. Democrats will promote their agenda zealously, without compromise, and with or without your support.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) slammed the Biden administration on Friday after White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki appeared to sidestep a question on whether the administration would commit to replenishing Israel""s Iron Dome missiles, which fired hundreds this week as it defended itself from rocket attacks launched by Palestinian terrorist organizations inside Gaza. Cruz responded to the following interaction that Psaki had with a reporter during a press briefing: REPORTER: First, 1,500 rockets from Gaza going toward Israel. The Iron Dome has taken down many, many rockets. That""s cost a lot of munitions. Is the U.S. going to help Israel replenish the Iron Dome? PSAKI: Well, I don""t have anything to preview in terms of additional assistance. I will say that we have an important relationship, partnership — strategic security relationship with Israel.

Nothing has changed in regard to that approach, and I don""t expect it would, moving forward.  REPORTER: On April 7th, the State Department announced that it had unlocked $75 million in economic assistance to the West Bank and Gaza.  PSAKI: Mm-hmm.  REPORTER: Is that being reviewed in light of the rocket attacks coming from Gaza into Israel?  PSAKI: No. That was humanitarian assistance the — to the Palestinian people. Again, Hamas is a terrorist organization. The Palestinian people are also suffering as a result of the actions of this terrorist organization, and the steps — the — the rockets that they have launched into Israel. So, no, the humanitarian assistance will, of course, continue.  REPORTER: And what specific steps has President Biden taken to help de-escalate the conflict?  PSAKI: Well, I went through this a little bit the other day, but let me — let me go through some of it. First, as you know, the president obviously has had his own conversations — conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu. We""ve had dozens of high-level calls and meetings with senior U.S. officials and with senior officials from Israel, the Palestinian Authority, our Arab partners, and other stakeholders. Our National Security Advisor has spoken with his counterpart in Israel multiple times. We""ve had regular dialogue multiple times per day with Egyptian and Qatari officials. So we have been incredibly engaged at the highest level here from the federal government. As you know, sometimes those conversations need to take place privately. And we, of course, want to convey who we""re talking to and what we — the messages we""re conveying, but we""re not going to read out every single conversation either.  REPORTER: Is President Biden just trying to stay out of it?  PSAKI: I think that what I just outlined makes clear that he""s asked his team to not only keep him updated and abreast of what""s happening on the ground, but to be deeply engaged with the Israelis, the Palestinians, and also with leaders and partners in the region to work toward a more lasting peace.  REPORTER: But when he said this week that it was going to be closing down sooner rather than later, what was the indication from his conversations with Netanyahu that that would be the case?  PSAKI: Well, that was certainly our hope. And obviously, what happened, I think, earlier this week is that assurances from Hamas that they were prepared to stand down proved to be false. And we certainly understand that that can happen in these conflicts, but we still need to stay at it and remain engaged with all of the parties in the region.

blaze|"Former Associated Press reporter Matti Friedman directly contradicted Associated Press President and CEO Gary Pruitt, who claimed Saturday the AP was unaware that Hamas terrorists were using the same building in Gaza City where AP and other media outlets housed their Gaza bureaus. After Israeli Defense Forces targeted a high-rise building in Gaza Saturday, which housed an AP bureau along with offices for other media outlets including Al Jazeera, the IDF revealed Hamas intelligence forces also occupied the building. In a statement , Pruitt claimed his staffers ""had no indication"" Hamas worked from the building, and demanded Israel reveal evidence to prove terrorists, in fact, occupied the building. ""The Israeli government says the building contained Hamas military intelligence assets. We have called on the Israeli government to put forward the evidence,"" Pruitt said. ""AP's bureau has been in this building for 15 years. We have had no indication Hamas was in the building or active in the building,"" he added. ""This is something we actively check to the best of our ability. We would never knowingly put our journalists at risk."" The former AP journalist revealed in a 2014 article for the Atlantic that AP journalists knew about the presence of Hamas terrorists, explaining how Hamas uses the media to disseminate its narrative about the Israel-Palestine conflict. Friedman also explained that Hamas knows ""international coverage from the territory could be molded to its needs"" and that reporters can ""be intimidated when necessary and that they would not report the intimidation."" A source close to Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi told the Jerusalem Post that Israeli officials provided the U.S. government with evidence to corroborate their claim that Hamas military assets operated from of the building. ""We showed them the smoking gun proving Hamas worked out of that building,"" the source said. ""I understand they found the explanation satisfactory."" In fact, officials in multiple Israeli government agencies confirmed the call that took place between President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday was to, in part, show American officials the intelligence confirming Hamas' presence inside the building. During the call, Biden reaffirmed his ""strong support for Israel's right to defend itself against rocket attacks from Hamas,"" Reuters reported ."
blaze|"Fox News reporter Peter Doocy confronted White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Friday over the timing of new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lifting face mask restrictions for fully vaccinated Americans. Republicans accused the Biden administration of rolling out new guidance on Thursday — that allows fully vaccinated Americans to return to normal life — to score political brownie points. ""Why today? The science hasn't changed,"" Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said. ""While the new mask guidance is encouraging, the CDC and my Far Radical Left colleagues only chose to do this to distract from the consequences of catastrophic policy decisions that have been heard around the world,"" Rep. Andy Biggs, chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said . ""Inflation is rising, the Middle East is in shambles, the working class can't fill up their gas tanks, our border is being overrun and the Biden Administration's leadership is nowhere to be found,"" he added. Not only did Doocy question whether the new guidance was politically motivated, but he confronted Psaki with President Joe Biden's own words in March about lifting pandemic-related restrictions. In March, Biden accused Texas and Mississippi of ""Neanderthal thinking"" after those states decided to lift pandemic-related restrictions and rescind mask mandates. Noting that fewer than half of American adults are fully vaccinated, Doocy asked, ""So, what happened to President Biden saying in March that he thought lifting mask mandates before every adult American goes and gets a shot is 'Neanderthal thinking?'"" In response, Psaki said science has been the government's ""North Star,"" and she denied claims that the CDC's new guidance was politically motivated. Because Psaki did not directly address Doocy's question, the Fox News reporter doubled down, asking again if Biden still believes states like Texas and Mississippi — those that reopened months ago — are guilty of ""Neanderthal thinking?"" Pskai, however, did not directly address Biden's words in her response.   Jen Psaki holds White House press briefing | 5/14/2021   youtu.be"
blaze|"President Joe Biden's sole administration pick to fail in making it through Senate confirmation has landed a gig in the White House, after all. CNN reported the Neera Tanden — whose nomination for Office of Management and Budget chief was withdrawn when it became apparent that not enough senators would approve her — is now a senior adviser to Biden. CNN reported that according to a White House official, ""Tanden will begin planning for potential policy changes that could result from the forthcoming US Supreme Court decision on Republican legal efforts to strike down the Affordable Care Act,"" in her new role. The outlet noted that Tanden previously worked in the Obama administration. She most recently served as head of left-wing think tank Center for American Progress, and is reportedly "" a close ally "" of White House chief of staff Ron Klain. Tanden's OMB nomination was derailed after hearings focused on several of her past tweets, wherein she attacked several of the senators who would weigh in on her fitness for the role. Tanden hit out at several Republicans in now-deleted tweets, which resurfaced once her nomination was announced. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) reminded her during a hearing: But the former OMB pick did not just attack Republicans. She also targeted democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) during the Democratic presidential primary, prompting him to complain to the Center for American Progress at the time. Tanden apologized to the Senate for ""any hurt"" that her ""rhetoric"" and ""language"" caused, and admitted that she spent months ahead of her nomination deleting social media posts. The death knell to Tanden's nomination was when moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) announced that he would not approve her for the role in a Senate that is split 50-50. Manchin said of Tanden in February, """"I believe her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget,"" he explained . ""For this reason, I cannot support her nomination."" Tanden's nomination was withdrawn in early March. OMB deputy director Shalanda Young is currently acting as interim chief until a permanent director is confirmed, The Washington Examiner reported."
blaze|"Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told a House committee this week that there is no law outlawing the practice known a partial-birth abortion. Becerra's assertion likely came as a surprise to his boss, President Joe Biden, who voted for the law when he was a U.S. senator, and to the Supreme Court, which upheld the partial-birth abortion ban in 2007. During testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's health subcommittee Wednesday, Rep. Gus Bilirakis (R-Fla.) pressed Becerra on whether the Biden administration would uphold the ban. The lawmaker also asked the secretary if he believed the practice to be illegal,  the Christian Post noted . Becerra responded by denying that a legal ban on partial-birth abortion even exists. ""We will continue to make sure we follow the law,"" Becerra said. ""With due respect, there is no medical term like 'partial-birth abortion,' and so I would probably have to ask you what you mean by that to describe what is allowed by law. Roe v. Wade is very clear. It's settled precedent, a woman has a right to make decisions about her reproductive health, and we will make sure that we enforce the law and protect those rights."" Bilirakis didn't let the secretary off easily and asked if he agreed with the ban on partial-birth abortion, to which Becerra responded, "" There is no law that deals specifically with the term 'partial-birth abortion.' We have clear precedent in the law on the rights that women have to reproductive health care"" (emphasis added). Rep. John Joyce (R-Pa.) confronted Becerra on his claim that there is no law banning partial-birth abortion, pointing out that the actual section of U.S. Code dealing with the topic is titled ""Partial-birth abortions prohibited."" Becerra ignored the language of the statute and responded by saying that though the term ""partial-birth abortion"" is ""recognized in politics, it is not a medically recognized term."" He added that the focus should be on the ""reproductive rights"" and refused to even acknowledge the existence of the partial-birth abortion ban. Becerra was clearly (and purposefully) ignoring the law that is on the books — and the fact that his boss, President Biden, voted for the bill in 2003, sending it to President George W. Bush's desk for his signature. He also ignored the fact that the Supreme Court in 2007 ruled the ban is constitutional. The relevant portion of the law — 18 U.S. Code § 1531 - Partial-birth abortions prohibited — not only uses the term ""partial-birth abortion"" in its title, but it also employs the term in the text of the law — and even provides a definition for the term, helping to avoid confusion or attempts to pretend it doesn't exist:"
blaze|"House lawmakers have reached a deal to create a bipartisan, independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 ""domestic terror attack on the United States Capitol"" and to recommend changes to protect the building in the future. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) announced the legislation to create the commission on Friday, which will be co-sponsored by committee ranking member Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.). ""There has been a growing consensus that the January 6th attack is of a complexity and national significance that what we need an independent commission to investigate. I am pleased that after many months of intensive discussion, Ranking Member Katko and I were able to reach a bipartisan agreement,"" Thompson said. The commission will be responsible for studying the facts and circumstances that led to the events of Jan. 6, when supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying the Electoral College results and declaring President Joe Biden the winner of the 2020 election. Rioters trespassed in the Capitol building and assaulted several Capitol Police officers during the day's events. One woman, Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt, was shot by Capitol Police and later died of her injuries. The makeup of the Jan. 6 commission will be similar to the 9/11 commission, featuring 10 commissioners, five Republicans and five Democrats, who will be appointed by House and Senate leaders in both parties. ""Commissioners must have significant expertise in the areas of law enforcement, civil rights, civil liberties, privacy, intelligence, and cybersecurity. Current government officers or employees are prohibited from appointment,"" Thompson's announcement said. The commission will have the authority to issue subpoenas in the course of its investigation with joint agreement between the chair and vice chair or a vote by a majority of commission members. A final report on the commissions findings and recommendations to prevent a future attack on the Capitol will be due by Dec. 31, 2021. ""Inaction – or just moving on – is simply not an option. The creation of this commission is our way of taking responsibility for protecting the U.S. Capitol. After all, the Capitol is not just a historic landmark, it is where our constituents come to see their democracy in action,"" Thompson said. ""As such, we owe it to the Capitol Police and all who enter our citadel of democracy to investigate the attack. The timing of this action is particularly poignant with this being National Police Week, when we honor those who gave their lives to protect us."" Katko praised the agreement in a statement. ""Unfortunately the Capitol remains a target for extremists of all ideologies, as we also witnessed during the April 2 attack that took a Capitol Police officer's life. That's why we must do everything we can to ensure nothing like this can ever happen again,"" Katko said . ""An independent, bipartisan commission will remove politicization of the conversation and focus solely on the facts and circumstances surrounding the security breach at the Capitol as well as other instances of violence relevant to such a review."" However, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) expressed concerns with the legislation shortly after it was announced, telling reporters that he hadn't approved the agreement and wasn't aware the announcement would be made Friday morning. ""That's very concerning to me,"" McCarthy said after a reporter informed him the commission's scope would be limited to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. """"You've got to look at what the build-up before and what has gone on afterwards, otherwise the commission does not work,"" he added. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement it is ""imperative that we seek the truth of what happened on January 6 with an independent, bipartisan 9/11-type Commission to examine and report upon the facts, causes and security relating to the terrorist mob attack."""
blaze|"The theory that the novel coronavirus was unleashed upon the world through a laboratory leak must be taken seriously until proven wrong by a data-driven investigation, Reuters reported , citing a group of leading scientists. The outlet focused on a Friday letter from 18 scientists that was published in the journal Science indicating ""more investigation is still needed to determine the origin of the pandemic."" Authors of the letter include Ravindra Gupta, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Cambridge; Jesse Bloom, who studies the evolution of viruses at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; and David Relman, professor of microbiology at Stanford. Their letter states that ""theories of accidental release from a lab and animal-to-human transmission both remain viable,"" and that ""knowing how COVID-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks."" The scientists who penned the letter called attention to the findings of a China–World Health Organization joint study released in November that indicated animal-to-human virus transmission from an intermediate host was ""likely to very likely"" while a laboratory incident was ""extremely unlikely."" However, the letter states that ""the two theories were not given balanced consideration. Only 4 of the 313 pages of the report and its annexes addressed the possibility of a laboratory accident"" and that WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said as much while offering ""to provide additional resources to fully evaluate the possibility."" The scientists who penned the letter indicated they possess ""relevant expertise"" on the subject and that they ""agree with the WHO director-general, the United States, and 13 other countries, and the European Union that greater clarity about the origins of this pandemic is necessary and feasible to achieve."" ""A proper investigation should be transparent, objective, data-driven, inclusive of broad expertise, subject to independent oversight, and responsibly managed to minimize the impact of conflicts of interest,"" the letter adds. ""Public health agencies and research laboratories alike need to open their records to the public. Investigators should document the veracity and provenance of data from which analyses are conducted and conclusions drawn, so that analyses are reproducible by independent experts."" The letter from the scientists ended with kudos to China, saying that ""in this time of unfortunate anti-Asian sentiment in some countries, we note that at the beginning of the pandemic, it was Chinese doctors, scientists, journalists, and citizens who shared with the world crucial information about the spread of the virus — often at great personal cost."" The notion that COVID-19 was leaked from a Wuhan, China, laboratory has long been a point of contention. Reports emerged in April 2020 reflecting that very theory . Former President Donald Trump said last spring he was very confident that the coronavirus originated from a Wuhan virology lab , as did the majority of American intelligence agencies and then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo . In September, Twitter reportedly suspended the account of Chinese virologist Dr. Li-Meng Yan just hours after she told Fox News host Tucker Carlson that China intentionally manufactured and released the COVID-19 virus . And just prior to President Joe Biden taking office in January, the U.S. State Department said it had new evidence possibly pointing to the coronavirus coming from a Wuhan lab — and that Chinese lab researchers might have been infected with COVID-19 before the first identified case of the outbreak."
blaze|"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finally eased indoor face mask requirements on Thursday. The new CDC guidance allows vaccinated Americans to not have to wear masks outdoor and in most indoor settings. Following the announcement, President Joe Biden issued his own new ""rule"" about face masks and coronavirus vaccinations, which caused a stir on social media, and many lambasted the order as ""authoritarian."" The official Twitter account for President Biden posted a video calling for Americans to get ""vaxxed or masked,"" and had the caption: ""Folks, if you're fully vaccinated — you no longer need to wear a mask. If you're not vaccinated yet — go to http://vaccines.gov to find a shot, and mask up until you're fully vaccinated."" The Twitter account for President Biden also posted a proclamation, ""The rule is now simple: get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do. The choice is yours."" There was an immediate backlash to Biden's ""rule."" Twitter reactions labeled the order as unconstitutional, and said the ultimatum wasn't really a ""choice."" BlazeTV host Glenn Beck hurled back, "" Hey #POTUS - the rule is simple. Kindly, screw off. You will find the rules in a little read document called 'the constitution'. The sequel is even better. You can find it on line under 'The Bill of Rights'. You and your authoritarian pals will find it a quick read."" Rep. Thomas Massie (R-K.Y.) countered the president on Twitter, "" Show us in the Constitution where you have this power Mr @POTUS . (You don't)."" Rep. Paul Gosar (R- Ariz.) stated, "" Men must be governed by God or they will be ruled by tyrants."" Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.) retorted, ""R equirement to do one or the other of two things demanded by another person, against your will, is not called a choice; it's called coercion, and we reject it in a free society."" Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) reacted by saying, "" No. 1) The federal government can't force you to wear a mask until you're vaccinated, 2) it would also have no way of tracking vaccinations, and 3) this doesn't account for natural antibodies."" BlazeTV host Chad Prather fired back, ""Eat s**t Adolph."" Donald Trump Jr tweeted, "" Um, team Biden, Joe somehow got a hold of his Twitter account and is talking all crazy again."" Actor Rob Schneider snapped back, "" The rule is even simpler, YOU are an elected official of a Republic, not a doctor or Russian Czar, therefore it is the citizens who will make THEIR OWN HEALTH DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES. The CHOICE IS INDEED FOR EACH AND EVERY FREE AMERICAN AS THEY SEE FIT!"" Conservative comedians the Hodge Twins pointed out, "" Choice is a decision between a several options. An ultimatum is a final demand of terms, the rejection of which will result in retaliation or a breakdown in relations. Dictators and their sheep usually can't tell the difference because you're idiots."" Conservative activist Scott Presler explained, ""The rule is simple: the government has no authority to tell me how to live as a private citizen & I'm not forced to disclose my health. We can defeat this authoritarian gov't by electing more leaders, like Ron DeSantis."" Sebastian Gorka , the former deputy assistant to former President Donald Trump, quipped, "" My body. My choice buster."" Cultural critic James Lindsay replied, "" We have replaced 'mean' tweets with nakedly authoritarian ones. This is fine."" Mediaite senior columnist John Ziegler responded by saying, "" If Trump had been pro-mask from the start & said this now, the woke crowd would be taking to the streets. This is clearly a move to help the mask cult accept this new edict by making them feel better knowing they can still feel morally superior to, & be allowed to shame, others."" One commenter added, ""Y ou nor the government have any sort of authority to force me or any other person for that matter to wear a mask. Plain and simple. Time for bed Joe."" Another person noted, "" Biden is vocally tougher on unvaccinated Americans than terrorists who hacked American infrastructure."" Someone wrote, "" Imagine what the media would say if Trump tweeted this."" A Twitter user joked, ""I 'identify' as someone who is vaccinated."""
blaze|"Cpl. Keith Heacook. Say his name , because the president of the United States won't utter it, even though this officer was beaten to death in Biden's own home state by a career violent criminal. For that matter, I can't find too many Republicans mentioning this and turning Keith Heacook's murder into the ""Back the Blue"" version of George Floyd. And in this case, this particular tragedy actually reflects a broader ""systemic"" ill in our society that requires true ""criminal justice reform."" Heacook's murder by an ""unarmed"" violent career criminal while responding to a 911 call touches upon nearly everything broken in our criminal justice deterrent, which is threatening to endanger the lives of cops and civilians more and more in the coming months. Just weeks away from retirement, Cpl. Heacook, a Delmar, Maryland, police officer, responded to a 911 call that Randon Wilkerson was beating on roommates in a shared home on Sunday, April 25. Heacook responded to what he clearly knew was a violent situation all alone while it was still dark. As my TheBlaze colleague Sarah Taylor reported at the time, the budget for these small-town police is so small that the officer was forced to respond to a violent situation alone. Also, because Delmar on the Delaware side is so understaffed, Heacook, who was from Delmar on the Maryland side, in Wicomico County, wound up responding. A retired Wicomico County police officer who spoke with TheBlaze on condition of anonymity said that because the city of Delmar does not have 24-hour service, the Wicomico County Sheriff's Office handles calls and dispatches officers when there is nobody available on the Delaware side. Officers of the Delmar police force have to be sworn in both in Maryland and Delaware. Based on the information available and from other victims who were later attacked, it appears that Wilkerson somehow overpowered Heacook and allegedly beat him with his own baton and then throat-stomped him while he was on the ground. He later died of his horrific injuries. Wilkerson then allegedly broke into a house across the street and severely beat an elderly couple who gave the original eyewitness account of Wilkerson's attack on Officer Heacook. It's not clear if Heacook was ambushed or if he confronted Wilkerson head-on, but this likely represents the exact opposite of the Floyd case — a much more common phenomenon — when police go out of their way to use underwhelming force and decline to draw their guns even when confronted alone by a strong and violent criminal. It also demonstrates how often police head into violent situations without a partner because police are already so understaffed and undermanned. This further incentivizes criminals to fight rather than cooperate. For every single cop who uses too much force, how many use too little force, and how many more are increasingly likely to do so when confronted with black suspects? Heacook's cousin made this point very eloquently at the memorial service Monday. ""If Cpl. Heacook had to take the bad actor's life, what would have happened to his life?"" asked cousin Larry Schwartz, a former cop himself . ""It would've been hell. The media would've been here in full force ... 'Unarmed this, unarmed that' every night without fail."" ""Keith would have been placed on administrative leave while the investigation was conducted,"" he continued. ""That investigation would have taken weeks, if not months, to complete. During that time, Keith's life would have been put under a microscope, as it's easy for folks who have no idea about police work. His family would be shunned. Even when Keith was cleared, that does not generate enough news."" One has to wonder if this is what went through his mind and if this is why he hesitated. How many police homicides are the result of such hesitation driven by the politics of mob rule rather than prudent instincts to survive? We will never know because these cases seldom get reported, but they will likely become more numerous as time goes on. But there is one other important element to this story. As Sarah Taylor reported , Wilkerson had at least 38 arrests but doesn't appear to have served much time in prison. So not only are police understaffed and forced to make arrests alone with insane rules of engagement if the suspect is black, but there are more violent criminals out on the streets than ever before because of ""criminal justice reform."" Liberals often want to know why so many encounters that should be peaceful have to turn out deadly. The answer is because repeat violent offenders will turn anything into a deadly encounter, and now police are exponentially more likely to run into them because they are not in jail. The result is that either the cop is forced to shoot them, or, as the Heacook case shows, they will increasingly put themselves in danger against their own survival instincts so their families won't be destroyed by the media and the Black Lives Matter lynch mob. To this day, there are no follow-up media articles on this story. To this day, Joe Biden has not uttered a word about this police officer who was brutally murdered in his own state. To this day, there are no calls for police reform to make sure police have the manpower, training, and rules of engagement to protect their lives against the growing number of violent criminals. To this day, there is no call to bring back ""three strikes and you're out"" for criminals who keep reoffending."
blaze|"Bret Baier grilled Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) on whether her crusade against former President Donald Trump was in the interest of her constituents and she responded by criticizing Fox News. Cheney's appearance Thursday on Fox News was her first live interview since the Republican Party voted her out of her leadership position Wednesday. ""You, and your colleagues, at least in part, were elected to block the Biden agenda, which Republicans believe is too far left, and could lead to other things. Aren't they correct to claim that your focus on the election and President Trump was somehow not going to get them to that goal?"" Baier asked. ""No, I think that's actually wrong, Bret,"" Cheney responded. ""I think if you look at where we've been since the election since Jan.6, we've had a real focus on, making sure people understand that the Biden policies are dangerous,"" she explained. ""If you look at the impact for the people of Wyoming, banning oil and gas leases on public lands is really dangerous, is really heartless. We've been very clear about that. What's happening at the border is very dangerous,"" Cheney added. She went on to say that there were too many people in the Republican Party who were willing to enable Trump's claims that the election was fraudulent. ""The people of Wyoming believe deeply in the Constitution. The people of Wyoming know that we must use the Constitution as our shield, that we must defend the Constitution,"" explained Cheney. ""And so when you look at the challenge that the former president is presenting, right now still today, claiming that the election was stolen, claiming that our electoral process does not accurately reflect the will of the people. No remorse or regret for Jan. 6, continuing to use the language that we know inspired value in the past,"" she said. Baier interrupted her and pushed her on why her crusade was representing voters in Wyoming when Cheney zeroed in on Fox News. ""We all have an obligation and I would say Fox News especially, especially Fox News, has a particular obligation to make sure people know the election wasn't stolen,"" Cheney said. ""And we've said that numerous times,"" Baier said. Cheney and Baier interrupted each other as Baier attempted to respond to her demand. ""Brett, you're doing the interview, I'm answering the questions,"" Cheney said testily. ""We need to make sure that the American people recognize and understand that the election wasn't stolen, that we shouldn't perpetuate the big lie, and there's real danger,"" she continued. She went on to say that she did not vote for Joe Biden and that she would not vote for a Democrat ""ever."" She also said that Trump's policies were better for the country than those of Biden. ""The issue is whether or not we are going to stand up for the rule of law and stand up for the Constitution. That is above partisanship, that is above politics,"" Cheney concluded.

breitbart|"President Joe Biden""s deputies are congratulating themselves for delivering foreign migrants into Americans"" workplaces, communities, and society without approval from Congress or debate with the worried voters. ""We""re increasing and improving legal migration,"" Tyler Moran, a White House official, told the Washington Post . ""We have put in place a number of policies creating legal pathways to migrate and seek protection, and we see that as a metric of success,"" she added. ""We have a three-pronged approach,"" Biden""s border chief, Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), told a Senate hearing on May 13. ""Address the root causes of migration, to build legal pathways into the U.S., and to advocate more with the hope that Congress will pass immigration reform,"" he said. Mayorkas is opening legal pathways into Americans"" workplaces and homes by widening the side doors in immigration law, such as parole admissions and asylum claims. He is also widening the doors to legalization by easing the award of green cards to illegal or unlawful migrants. White House spokeswoman Pili Tobar worked in a variety of advocacy migration jobs before joining Biden""s administration. On May 7, she tweeted: The vast majority of ""vetted sponsors or family members"" for supposedly unaccompanied children are illegally present in the United States. Many of those sponsors paid coyotes — and the cartels — to deliver their children or job-seeking teenage boys to U.S. agents on the border. Mayorkas"" agency is now completing the contracted delivery — gratis — of the young migrants to their U.S.-based illegal migrant relatives. Mayorkas is declining to use a court decision that would allow him to stop the coyote-delivered entry of so-called ""unaccompanied"" youths and children into the United States. The DHS secretary told the Senate in testimony that he wants to provide asylum approval to youths and children who have not even left their home country: ""If we can, in fact, adjudicate asylum claims in the countries of origin, or in truly safe places, then we will spare children the perilous journey north."" He added, ""These are people, yearning to be free."" In April, Mayorkas used optional Title 8 rules to allow roughly 60,000 people across the border, including roughly 35,000 people from distant places other than Mexico or Central America. DHS does not repatriate migrants who try to sneak across the border, helping roughly 45,000 do so in April, often on their second or third attempts. Moreover, the very lax enforcement rules at DHS leave migrants with little fear of being deported. At least 11 million people are already living illegally in the United States. Mayorkas is using the parole side door in immigration law to bring thousands of legally deported migrants back into the United States. The DHS secretary is also drafting regulations that would dramatically raise the number of poor economic migrants who could use claims of crime or domestic abuse to get U Visas or T Visas and then win the huge prize of U.S. citizenship. He is also stripping away bureaucratic and regulatory curbs on the Fortune 500 hiring of foreign graduates for jobs needed by American graduates. In addition, he is backing a bill that would automatically award green cards to foreign migrants if they perform 10 years of work for U.S. companies. As administration officials try to create new their migration pipelines without approval by Congress or debate with the public, they are dismissing media coverage — and public criticism — of the migration wave as a distraction. Roughly 178,000 migrants were recorded arriving at the border, marking a 20-year record. According to the Washington Post : The ""full story,"" as described by Moran, does not include the economic damage – such as housing prices — done to native-born and immigrant Americans, the expanding poverty and regional gaps in U.S. society, or the damage done to migrants"" home countries by the left-wing policy of extracting migrants for use in the U.S. economy. Republican legislators are pushing back, but usually with ineffective rhetoric about socialism, border chaos, or illegal migrants. The rhetoric looks good on some conservative websites, and it avoids a clash with pro-migration business donors, who oppose any GOP talk about immigration, jobs, wages, and careers. For example, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) responded to Mayorkas"" May 13 hearing comments by pointing to the crush of migrants at the border: But some GOP politicians are cutting the heart of the issue. ""The open borders policy of Democrats is driving down the wages of millions of Americans,"" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said Wednesday during a May 12 hearing for a Democrat amnesty bill. He continued: Pro-American activists are sharpening their responses: ""It is extraction immigration,"" said Rob Law, the director of regulatory affairs and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies. He added: For many years, a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young U.S. graduates. This opposition is multiracial , cross-sex , non-racist , class-based , bipartisan , rational , persistent , and recognizes the solidarity Americans owe to each other. The voter opposition to elite-backed economic migration coexists with support for legal immigrants and some sympathy for illegal migrants. But only a minority of Americans — mostly leftists — embrace the many skewed polls and articles pushing the 1950""s corporate ""Nation of Immigrants"" claim. The deep public opposition to labor migration is built on the widespread recognition that legal and illegal migration moves money away from most Americans"" pocketbooks and families. Migration moves money from employees to employers , from families to investors , from young to old , from children to their parents , from homebuyers to investors , from technology to stoop labor , from red states to blue states , and from the central  states to the coastal states such as New York ."

About seventeen states, led by Republican governors, have either lifted their mask mandates or never enacted them, including highly populated states in Florida and Texas. ""Mask up. Mask up. It""s a patriotic duty. It""s the only way we get back to normal,"" he said. Joe Biden even urged private businesses to continue requiring that customers wear masks. He pointed to a warning of ""impending doom"" from Centers for Disease Control Director Rochelle Walensky earlier Monday, urging Americans to keep following coronavirus restrictions and guidelines. ""This is deadly serious,"" Biden said, and added, ""The failure to take this virus seriously is what precisely got us into this mess in the first place. Biden also condemned Americans who continued to travel and party during spring break, predicting a spike of cases as a result. ""New variants are spreading, and sadly, some of the reckless behavior we""ve seen on television over the past few weeks means that more new cases are to come in the weeks ahead,"" he said. Biden said Americans were mistakenly letting up on the coronavirus restrictions. ""Now is not the time to let down. Now is not the time to celebrate,"" he said.

slate|"Also in Slate: S hmuel Rosner examined the  ""erratic pragmatism"" of Biden""s Middle East policy . Jack Shafer called Biden ""the unusually creepy kind"" of plagiarist . Teachers and scholars consider the unattributed use of someone else""s words and ideas to be a very serious offense, but the public doesn""t seem to mind much, at least when it comes to politics. The incidents of plagiarism and fabrication that forced Joe Biden to quit the 1988 presidential race have drawn little comment since his selection as Barack Obama""s vice presidential running mate—just as revelations of plagiarism by Stephen Ambrose and Doris Kearns Goodwin scarcely hurt their book sales. In 1987, before Biden quit the race, he called the incidents ""a tempest in a teapot."" Although most reporters disagreed then, at least enough to pursue the story, they seem now—perhaps jaded by two decades of scandal-mongering—to have come around to Biden""s view. But Biden""s exit from the 1988 race is worth recalling in detail, because his transgressions far exceeded Obama""s own relatively innocent lifting of rhetorical set pieces from his friend Deval Patrick, which occasioned a brief flap last February. Biden""s misdeeds encompassed numerous self-aggrandizing thefts, misstatements, and exaggerations that seemed to point to a serious character defect. In some ways, the 1988 campaign—in which scandal forced not just Biden but also Gary Hart from the race—marked a watershed in the absurd gotcha politics that have since marred our politics and punditry. But unlike Hart""s plight, Biden""s can""t be blamed on an overly intrusive or hectoring press corps. The press was right to dig into this one. In the 1988 race, Biden began as a long shot. But after Hart dropped out in May 1987 over the exposure of his affair with Donna Rice, none of the remaining ""seven dwarves"" in the Democratic field pulled away from the pack. Biden""s youth and vitality—as well as his tutelage by Patrick Caddell, the pollster-consultant considered a veritable magician by insiders—made him a decent bet to reach the front of the pack. Over the summer, the rival campaigns of Michael Dukakis and Dick Gephardt became concerned as Biden ticked upward in the polls. Biden""s downfall began when his aides alerted him to a videotape of the British Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock, who had run unsuccessfully against Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The tape showed Kinnock delivering a powerful speech about his rise from humble roots. Taken by the performance, Biden adapted it for his own stump speech. Biden, after all, was the son of a car salesman, a working-class kid made good. Kinnock""s material fit with the story he was trying to sell. At first Biden would credit Kinnock when he quoted him. But at some point he failed to offer the attribution. Biden maintained that he lapsed only once—at a debate at the Iowa State Fair, on Aug. 23, when cameras recorded it—but Maureen Dowd of the New York Times reported two incidents of nonattribution, and no one kept track exactly of every time Biden used the Kinnock bit. (Click here for examples of Biden""s lifting.) What is certain is that Biden didn""t simply borrow the sort of boilerplate that counts as common currency in political discourse—phrases like ""fighting for working families."" What he borrowed was Kinnock""s life. Biden lifted Kinnock""s precise turns of phrase and his sequences of ideas—a degree of plagiarism that would qualify any student for failure, if not expulsion from school. But the even greater sin was to borrow biographical facts from Kinnock that, although true about Kinnock, didn""t apply to Biden. Unlike Kinnock, Biden wasn""t the first person in his family history to attend college, as he asserted; nor were his ancestors coal miners, as he claimed when he used Kinnock""s words. Once exposed, Biden""s campaign team managed to come up with a great-grandfather who had been a mining engineer, but he hardly fit the candidate""s description of one who ""would come up from the mines after 12 hours and play football."" At any rate, Biden had delivered his offending remarks with an introduction that clearly implied he had come up with them himself and that they pertained to his own life. Most American political reporters were not so attuned to Britain""s politics that they recognized Kinnock""s words. But Michael Dukakis"" adviser John Sasso had seen the Kinnock tape. Without his boss""s knowledge or consent, he prepared a video juxtaposing the two men""s speeches and got it into the hands of Dowd at the Times , David Yepsen of the Des Moines Register , and NBC News. When the story broke on Sept. 12, Biden was gearing up to chair the Supreme Court nomination hearings for Robert Bork, Ronald Reagan""s far-right nominee. Biden angrily denied having done anything wrong and urged the press to chase after the political rival who had sent out what came to be called the ""attack video."" Unfortunately for Biden, more revelations of plagiarism followed, distracting him from the Bork hearings. Over the next days, it emerged that Biden had lifted significant portions of speeches from Robert Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey. From Kennedy, he took four long sentences in one case and two memorable sentences in another. (In one account, Biden said that Pat Caddell had inserted them in his speech without Biden""s knowledge; in another account, the failure to credit RFK was chalked up to the hasty cutting and pasting that went into the speech.) From Humphrey, the hot passage was a particularly affecting appeal for government to help the neediest. Yet another uncited borrowing came from John F. Kennedy. If that wasn""t bad enough, Biden admitted the next day that while in law school he had received an F for a course because he had plagiarized five pages from a published article in a term paper that he submitted. He admitted as well that he had falsely stated that British Labor official Denis Healey had given him the Kinnock tape. (Healey had denied the claim.) And Biden conceded that he had exaggerated in another matter by stating in a speech some years earlier that he had joined sit-ins to desegregate restaurants and movie theaters, and was thus actively involved in the civil rights movement. He protested, his press secretary clarified, ""to desegregate one restaurant and one movie theater."" The latter two of these fibs were small potatoes by any reckoning, but in the context of other acts of dishonesty, they helped to form a bigger picture. For all these disclosures, Biden remained unbowed. ""I""m in the race to stay, I""m in the race to win, and here I come,"" he declared. That meant, of course, that his days were numbered. Newsweek soon reported on a C-SPAN videotape from the previous April that showed Biden berating a heckler at a campaign stop. While lashing out at the audience member, Biden defended his academic credentials by inflating them, in a fashion that was notably unbecoming and petty for a presidential candidate. ""I think I probably have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect,"" Biden sniped at the voter. ""I went to law school on a full academic scholarship."" That claim was false, as was another claim, made in the same rant, that he graduated in the top half of his law-school class. Biden wrongly stated, too, that he had earned three undergraduate degrees, when in fact he had earned one—a double major in history and political science. Another round of press inquiries followed, and Biden finally withdrew from the race on Sept. 23. The sheer number and extent of Biden""s fibs, distortions, and plagiarisms struck many observers at the time as worrisome, to say the least. While a media feeding frenzy (a term popularized in the 1988 campaign) always creates an unseemly air of hysteria, Biden deserved the scrutiny he received. Quitting the race was the right thing to do. Twenty-one years on, how much should Biden""s past behavior matter? In and of itself, the plagiarism episode shouldn""t automatically disqualify Biden from regaining favor and credibility, especially if in the intervening two decades he""s not done more of the same, as seems to be the case. But no one has looked into it. The press should give his record since 1988 a thorough vetting. It""s worth knowing whether the odds-on favorite to be our next vice president has truly reformed himself of behavior that can often be the mark of a deeply troubled soul. *** Note: In an article about plagiarism, crediting sources seems especially wise. I relied on three books about the 1988 campaign: Jack Germond and Jules Witcover""s Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars?: The Trivial Pursuit of the Presidency 1988 ; Sidney Blumenthal""s Pledging Allegiance: The Last Campaign of the Cold War ; and Peter Goldman and Tom Mathews"" The Quest for the Presidency 1988 , along with articles from the New York Times and Washington Post ."
slate|"For the vast majority of his career, Joe Biden was a proud deficit hawk—a man who fretted for decades about federal spending and, on occasion, bragged about his own personal attempts in the 1980s ""to freeze all government spending, including Social Security,"" in the name of fiscal prudence. Now, in the midst of a Democratic primary that has seen the party move left on nearly every major policy issue, Biden""s rivals are attacking him for that record, and rightly so:  Biden""s past willingness to put popular entitlements on the table could be a serious political liability in a race against Donald Trump, who has repeatedly promised not to cut Social Security benefits for the elderly. Just as importantly, the former vice president""s history on the budget raises serious questions about whether he would cave to sudden demands for austerity if he were ever confronted by a Republican Congress, much as he was seemingly ready to do during the Obama administration. So far, the criticisms about Biden""s record on federal spending and Social Security have primarily come from Bernie Sanders and his supporters. Unfortunately, not all of their accusations have been fair. On January 7, for instance, the Vermont senator sent out a newsletter that claimed Biden had ""lauded Paul Ryan for proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare"" during a 2018 speech at the Brookings Institution. As Politifact reported , this was untrue; in his own slightly muddled way, Biden appeared to be sarcastically mocking Ryan for proposing tax cuts so sweeping that they could only be paid for with large entitlement cuts. At the New York Times, Paul Krugman seized on the distortion to accuse Sanders of ""smearing"" Biden and adopting ""Trumpian"" tactics. And yet, as Krugman admits, there""s no getting around the fact that Biden spent the vast majority of his time in Washington beating the drum for budget cuts. Was he just a product of his times? Sort of. Biden joined the Senate at a moment when New Deal liberalism was giving way to fiscal conservatism and skepticism about big government. After Ronald Reagan""s victory, plenty of Democrats tacked to the center on issues such as crime and spending, and over the coming decades, debt-panic and a grave willingness to ""tackle entitlements"" slowly became the mark of supposedly serious Washington politicians. But Biden was especially energetic about it all.  He began sponsoring bills designed to curb the budget in the late  1970s . In 1984, as deficits mounted thanks to Reagan""s tax cuts, Biden warned of looming economic catastrophe and co-sponsored legislation that would freeze all federal spending for a year, including Social Security. The idea flopped , but Biden still pushed similar  spending pauses throughout the decade. He also backed a  line-item  veto , another favored fad among deficit hawks. In 1995, he chose to side with the new Republican majority in Congress and backed a balanced budget amendment to the constitution, warning that the national debt was threatening to consume the rest of the federal budget. ""Unless this thing gets focused,"" he told the New York Times , ""by the time we face the music, everything I care about is going to be gone."" The amendment ultimately lost by a single vote in the Senate, because Democrats said that they were worried it would lead Congress to raid the Social Security Trust Fund in order to limit the deficit. Biden, along with other members of his party, had fought to tweak the amendment so that it would exclude the retirement program. But after that effort failed , he put his concerns aside and voted yay with the GOP anyway. When Republicans took a second doomed shot at the balanced budget amendment in 1997 , he supported it again . Biden was not always on the side of the deficit slashers and debt alarmists. He helped kill a balanced budget amendment in 1986, for instance , telling reporters that Congress had just passed a major piece of legislation meant to limit the deficit, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, and that lawmakers should wait to see how it worked (he also co-sponsored legislation to protect Social Security from the effect of that law). In 1995, the same year he got on board with the GOP""s constitutional amendment, he actually voted against a bill that would have balanced the budget within seven years, which President Bill Clinton later vetoed on the grounds that it was too draconian. Around that time, Biden gave a typically florid speech in which he insisted that he was as worried about the deficit as anybody, but suggested that the GOP needed to compromise on its time frame: I am one of those Democrats who voted for the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I have introduced, on four occasions—four occasions!—entire plans to balance the budget, knowing I""m not president, and I""m not the leader, for illustrative purposes. I tried with Senator Grassley back in the ""80s to freeze all government spending, including Social Security. Including everything. And the truth is, the last election did one thing. I don""t know if it made you guys the majority party for long, I don""t know. We""ll find out. But I know one thing it did. It made sure that there was nobody left in the left of my party who said, in fact, we don""t care about moving the budget toward balance. In a lot of ways, Biden""s remarks here perfectly symbolize the politics of that era, during which the word ""liberal"" was treated as a dirty word and lots of Democrats adopted center-right politics on issues like crime, welfare-reform, and the deficit in order to hold moderate voters and fend off the GOP""s worst plans. There were also good reasons for Biden to vote as a centrist; we think of Delaware as a solidly blue state today, but until 2001, the state""s other senator was a Republican. At the same time, there""s little evidence to suggest that Biden was anything but sincere in his positions. One notable thing about Biden""s Senate career is that he showed relatively little interest in economic issues, focusing more on foreign affairs and criminal justice, which fit with his committee assignments. Yes, he was a driving force behind the bankruptcy reform bill that has come to be seen as a sop to credit card companies in his home state of Delaware. But other than that, Biden""s main economic policy cause really seemed to be the debt. Now, decades later, it""s easy to imagine how Biden""s old words and causes could come back to haunt him against Trump. One of the president""s central campaign promises, the thing that made him look like a moderate in the eyes of many voters, was that he would not touch Medicare or Social Security benefits for the elderly (though disability is another story). Cut to a future Trump ad featuring ready-made C-SPAN clips of Biden waving his arms and boasting about trying to freeze the program, as Sanders staffer David Sirota was happy to highlight on Twitter a few weeks ago. JOE BIDEN: ""When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare & Medicaid. I meant veterans"" benefits....And I not only tried it once, I tried it twice, I tried it a 3rd time & I tried it a 4th time."" https://t.co/TpoSdmjGhA  pic.twitter.com/MIAx4nO9Qa It doesn""t help that Biden continued to talk about cuts to entitlements deep into his Senate career. Intercept reporter Ryan Grim has noted that when Biden campaigned for president in 2007, he told Meet the Press host Tim Russert that he would consider benefit and eligibility changes to Social Security and Medicare to deal with the deficit, and boasted about helping to negotiate the deal that raised the retirement age to 67. His current campaign platform actually calls for slightly expanding Social Security benefits for seniors. And yet, during that recent Brookings speech, he still somehow managed to suggest—albeit in an aside—that both Social Security and Medicare would need ""adjustments"" to stay around, which most pundits on the left have interpreted as a euphemism for ""cuts."" (This isn""t the first time Biden""s comments on the stump have clashed with his official platform; he""s talked about bringing back Obamacare""s individual mandate, even though his health care plan says nothing about doing so.) It""s exceedingly unlikely that a Democratic Congress would ever try to slash Social Security or Medicare. One important question, however, is what will happen if President Biden comes face-to-face with a Republican Congress—or even just a GOP-held House or Senate—that tries to force his hand on spending cuts. (Mitch McConnell has essentially said he will wait until a Democrat is in office to try to slash entitlements, because it""s too unpopular for the GOP to do on its own.) We know what transpired during the Obama administration: The White House tried to compromise. It agreed that the deficit was a clear and present danger—despite the fact that the economy was still depressed after the recession—and attempted to negotiate a grand bargain of spending cuts and tax increases. Biden himself led discussions with a bipartisan group on behalf of the administration, and appeared ready to give up trillions in budget reductions, though they wouldn""t have targeted the major entitlements. As late as 2014, Obama caved to Republican requests and included a proposal to slow down the growth of Social Security benefits in his annual budget (he later dropped the idea in the face of liberal pushback). Would a Biden administration travel down the same road, and try to compromise? Compromise, after all, is what Biden is running on. Ideally, a Democratic president in 2021 would not only oppose budget cuts today, but would jettison most of Washington""s obsession with so-called fiscal discipline. The national debt is, truly, among the least of our problems right now. We may need to fully pay for ongoing expenses like a healthcare expansion. But there are plenty of urgent priorities with big, one-time price tags—infrastructure, a transition to green energy—that could be deficit financed without causing any significant economic issues. Certainly, the rock bottom interest rates on U.S. treasury debt suggest we have plenty of room to borrow. It unfortunately might be too much to ask for that kind of leader. But at the very least, the next person in the Oval Office should be able to stand up to the debt scolds on the big issues, like entitlements or austerity. If they can""t, the sick and elderly will suffer, the economy will suffer, and their presidency will suffer. One tragedy of the Obama administration was how, following the failure of the grand bargain, the GOP still steamrolled it into passing major spending cuts that helped turn the economic recovery into a crawl, and may well have contributed to a Trump win in the end. Perhaps Biden learned a lesson from that experience, and would resist repeating it. But our ex-VP has talked extensively about his desire to return to an era of bipartisan cooperation. And whether we""re talking about Social Security or another major program, the budget is one area in which those instincts are truly scary. Slate is covering the stories that matter to you.

slate|"Democrats being Democrats, it""s no surprise that some are skittish about Hillary Clinton""s campaign, which has been hit with scandals and weak numbers in key swing states. To these Democrats, Clinton isn""t a strong bet, and worse, there isn""t a strong alternative. Bernie Sanders? Popular, but too far to the left to unify a broad and diverse national party. Martin O""Malley? Not exciting. Enter Joe Biden. The sitting vice president is the third-most visible Democratic politician behind President Barack Obama and Clinton. The Wall Street Journal  reports he""s moving closer to a run: He has sat with political allies, talked with family, and even met with influential Democrats like Elizabeth Warren. Yes, if he ran he""d start from behind, but he""s popular and could build a formidable primary campaign with the right backing and staff. There""s also something to the idea of a Biden run. Even as the favorite, Clinton needs an effective sparing partner on the trail. A Biden run might be good for her skills as a candidate— a point I""ve argued before . But it""s worth stepping from the horserace to ask a different kind of question: Would a run be good for Biden? Large parts of the Democratic Party—including a confrontational activist movement—are committed to de-escalating the war on drugs and moving crime policy away from the approach of the 1980s and 1990s, an approach that Biden pioneered. This is more than trouble for his still-hypothetical campaign; it""s trouble for his legacy . A large part of running for president is intense scrutiny on personal history and political records. But once you""re in office, that scrutiny subsides. Once you""ve left, it almost disappears. Right now, Biden is beloved, an avuncular and light-hearted figure who contrasts the president""s stoic cool and adds a touch of heart to the seemingly mechanistic Obama White House. Forgotten (at least, outside academia and a few corners of political media ) is Biden""s earlier persona: a leader in America""s drug war. For a generation, Biden was at the front of a national push for tough drug laws and police militarization. If you consider her time in Bill Clinton""s White House, that""s true for Hillary, too. The difference is that she was first lady—an advocate for her husband""s policies, but not a lawmaker. That""s why she""s able to meet face to face with members of the Black Lives Matter movement and not look disingenuous when she says she has changed her mind on the subject. Biden""s Senate career, by contrast, was defined by his aggressive and vocal support for the drug war. Here are the highlights of that history: In 1984, he worked with Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond and the Reagan administration to craft and pass the Comprehensive Control Act , which enhanced and expanded civil asset forfeiture, and entitled local police departments to a share of captured assets. Critics say this incentivizes abuse, citing countless cases of unfair and unaccountable seizures. In one case last February , Drug Enforcement Administration officers seized $11,000 in cash from a 24-year-old college student. They didn""t find guns or drugs, but they kept the money anyway. In 1986, Biden co-sponsored the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which created new mandatory minimum sentences for drugs, including the infamous crack -versus- cocaine sentencing disparity . A crack cocaine user with only five grams would receive five years without parole, while a powder cocaine user had to possess 500 grams before seeing the same punishment. The predictable consequence was a federal drug regime that put its toughest penalties on low-level drug sellers and the most impoverished drug users. Biden would also play an important role in crafting the 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act , which strengthened mandatory minimums for drug possession, enhanced penalties for people who transport drugs, and established the Office of National Drug Control Policy, whose director was christened ""drug czar"" by Biden. His broadest contribution to crime policy was the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act , commonly called the 1994 Crime Bill. Written by Biden and signed by President Clinton, it increased funds for police and prisons, fueling a huge expansion of the federal prison population. As journalist Radley Balko details in The Rise of The Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America""s Police Forces , it also contributed to the rapid growth of militarized police forces that used new federal funds to purchase hundreds of thousands of pieces of military equipment, from flak jackets and automatic rifles to armored vehicles and grenade launchers. The ""crime bill"" also brought a host of new federal death penalty crimes, which Biden celebrated in his defense of the bill. ""Let me define the liberal wing of the Democratic Party,"" he said to Sen. Orrin Hatch, ""The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is now for 60 new death penalties … the liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 100,000 cops. The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 125,000 new state prison cells."" It""s true that much of this—especially the most egregious and ill-conceived measures—was a response to extraordinarily high crime rates that devastated urban communities. Many of Biden""s allies, in fact, were black Democrats from communities where violence was common and pervasive. But Biden would keep this approach, even as violent crime declined through the 1990s and into the 2000s. He would continue to vote for strong anti-drug efforts, going as far as to push for a federal crackdown on raves , citing ecstasy distribution. While Biden has shifted on some drug issues, he remains a staunch defender of his record on crime, even as Bill and Hillary Clinton have expressed their regret for the consequences of the 1994 crime bill and other anti-drug policies. Joe Biden, in other words, is the Democratic face of the drug war. ""There""s a tendency now to talk about Joe Biden as the sort of affable if inappropriate uncle, as loudmouth and silly,"" says sociologist Naomi Murakawa in an interview with the Marshall Project to discuss her book The First Civil Right: How Liberals Built Prison America . ""But he""s actually done really deeply disturbing, dangerous reforms that have made the criminal justice system more lethal and just bigger."" In a Democratic primary that increasingly turns on these issues, having to defend or walk back those positions is a bad place to occupy. His opponents—whether Clinton or Bernie Sanders or Martin O""Malley—will use his record against him, and millions of Democrats will begin to see him like Murakawa does: as someone who widened the path to prison for countless young men of color. The end result for Biden would be a newly tarnished reputation and—in all likelihood—another failed presidential campaign. Which is to say that, if Biden thinks Hillary needs an opponent of her stature, he""s probably right. But before he makes the jump, he should ask himself: Is a campaign worth the damage it will do to him personally? After years in public life, is this how he wants to end his career?

slate|"Friday is the 100 th day of Joe Biden""s term. Traditionally, this period of a presidency involves media discussion of honeymoons , mandates , and ambitious agendas , but also of burgeoning scandals that threaten to stall the new administration""s momentum . Biden, however, has kept his scandal quotient near zero by refusing to address topics besides his popular COVID and economic relief initiatives. While some real screw-ups have taken place, they have been outnumbered by faux controversies hyped ineffectively by Republicans desperate to get traction against a president who appeals to many Americans because they don""t need to pay attention to what he""s doing on a day-to-day basis. We""ve ranked them all here, in order, from most to least legitimately suggestive of presidential dishonesty and/or incompetence. And yes, the hamburger thing is last. •  The refugee cap. On April 16, the administration announced that it would not be raising the historically low annual cap on refugee admissions imposed by Donald Trump, despite Biden having promised to do so many times during the 2020 campaign. This was a moral and political error whose egregiousness was made clear immediately when it was criticized openly by basically every other elected Democrat, including centrist-minded senior figures like Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin. Biden seems to have reasoned that raising Trump""s xenophobic refugee limit would draw attention to the administratively unrelated blame he is taking for an increase in undocumented Mexico–U.S. border crossings that began in 2020—blame that, however dubious , is understood by poll watchers as something that might weaken his standing with some swing voters. But everyone in the party except Biden seemed to believe that breaking a campaign promise in order to endorse an intentionally immigrant-hostile Trump policy was both bad governance and bad politics, and, after a few hours, the administration reversed its reversal .

In March, Politico reported on a 2018 incident in which a gun belonging to Biden""s son Hunter was briefly lost in the trash outside a Delaware grocery store after Hallie Biden—Hunter""s sister-in-law, the widow of his late brother Beau—took the gun away from Hunter and tried to dispose of it there. (It was eventually found by a man collecting recyclables.) Anonymous sources told the publication that, while the gun was still missing, Secret Service agents tried to take possession of gun-store paperwork that documented Hunter""s original purchase of the weapon. (The gothic slapstick of it all was undermined by the news that, according to a police report, Hunter believes Hallie confiscated the gun out of fear that he might harm himself.) Despite involving a facially credible allegation of an abuse of power—the idea is that the Secret Service might have tried to take the paperwork to prevent Hunter from being linked back to the then-missing gun if it ended up being used in a crime—this story hasn""t developed any further, perhaps because Republicans spent so much time crying wolf about Hunter Biden stories before and during the 2020 campaign. Congressional members of the GOP are, nonetheless, trying to keep it in the news . • Neera Tanden""s mean tweets. Yes, we""re on the third one of these and already using the phrase ""mean tweets""—it""s been a wild three months! But it does in fact qualify as a scandal, or at least a misstep , by historical standards, that would-be Office of Management and Budget director Neera Tanden""s nomination was pulled because some Senate Republicans were upset that she had previously used Twitter to describe them with such vicious, graphic insults as ""the worst"" and ""Voldemort."" • T.J. Ducklo. This one is not funny even in a Veep kind of way, but ranks below Tanden because of how minor a figure was involved, namely T.J. Ducklo, a deputy press secretary who resigned after Vanity Fair reported that he""d threatened to ""destroy"" a Politico reporter who was working on a story he didn""t like; Ducklo also told the reporter that he believed she was jealous of him for some reason involving a different man not being interested in having sex with her (the reporter). Very convoluted, but unquestionably inappropriate for the workplace! He is gone now. • Andrew Cuomo""s handling of nursing homes. It""s been established that Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo suppressed unflattering data that revealed the extent to which COVID-19 spread through his state""s nursing homes in the spring of 2020. This isn""t funny either; it also doesn""t have anything to do with Biden""s administration despite the best efforts of right-wing media outlets to suggest a connection . • Major Biden. One of Joe Biden""s rescue dogs keeps biting people at the White House, getting sent out for training , returning to the White House, and getting sent out for more training after biting more people. Now Jill Biden says they""re also gonna get a cat ! No! Don""t do it, Dr. Jill Biden! • Disrespecting the Space Force. In early February, two Republican congressmen made outraged statements accusing White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki of being too glib in answering a question about the Trump-founded ""Space Force"" military branch during a briefing. Her attitude, the GOP members said, evinced a troubling indifference to the upper-atmospheric threat presented by China, a warning that proved all too prescient this week, when D.C. was destroyed by Chinese UFO lasers. • Canceling Dr. Seuss. In early March, Biden issued a proclamation about Read Across America Day that broke from precedent by not specifically mentioning Dr. Seuss. This coincided with the decision by Dr. Seuss Enterprises to stop publishing six Seuss books , none of which were among his best-known, because they contain anachronistic, racist imagery. In the right wing""s telling, this became an attempt by Biden, and social-justice Democrats generally, to erase Dr. Seuss from history, to which some conservatives responded by making a show of ordering Seuss books, which, in addition to proving tangibly that Dr. Seuss"" work is still widely available, means many of them now own work that celebrates anti-materialist communitarianism , environmentalism , and the rewards of trying foreign food . • Indoctrinating border children with Kamala Harris"" book. On April 24, the New York Post ran a cover story which reported that a 2019 children""s book published under Vice President Kamala Harris"" name was being included in ""welcome kits"" for unaccompanied immigrant minors at a shelter in Southern California. The entire basis for this claim was a photo of one of the books at the shelter, and it turns out it was a single copy that had been donated to a book and toy drive. Pretty bad job there, New York Post! • If ground beef is outlawed, only outlaws will grind beef. Biden""s climate-related proposals are not going to require rationing red meat to the point that Americans can only eat one hamburger a month, as Fox News claimed while intentionally mangling an academic study that had already been intentionally mangled by the Daily Mail . In fact, they don""t mention red meat at all. This story, you might say, was just red meat for the easily angered right-wing base. Ha ha ha. Hahahahaha. How will the next 100 days ever top that?

slate|"Joe Biden has embraced the Green New Deal. He might not have uttered those magic words on Tuesday while unveiling his campaign""s new, far-reaching  plan to combat climate change and revitalize the U.S. economy, but he didn""t have to. In substance and spirit, the Democratic nominee has signed on to the concept""s most important pieces, while doing away with some of its more controversial, and less essential, trappings. It""s understandable why Biden might avoid the branding. For many moderates and conservatives, including our president , the phrase ""green new deal"" itself has become a shorthand for leftist overreach. In part, that""s because no one group can really claim complete ownership of the idea and some maximalist versions favored by young activists have included things like Medicare for All and a federal jobs guarantee, along with zeroing out carbon emissions, which make their proposals look a bit like democratic-socialist wishlists disguised as plans to stop global warming. When Democrats in Congress actually tried to write up an official Green New Deal framework in 2019, a bizarre, unofficial FAQ circulated by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez""s staff explained that they""d lowered their 10-year emissions goals a bit ""because we aren""t sure that we""ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast."" The result has been a never-ending stream of jokes about banning hamburgers—the kind of crazy that Biden, whose whole candidacy is basically comfort food for America""s moderates, would like to avoid. But when it comes to actual climate policy, the Green New Deal has always represented a very specific and serious philosophical shift. In the past, Democrats have wanted to reduce emissions through market-oriented mechanisms like a carbon tax or cap and trade. You still see prominent strains of that thinking today, such as when a bipartisan group of 45 renowned economists, including former Federal Reserve Chairs and nobel laureates, signed an open letter in the Wall Street Journal calling for a carbon-tax-and-dividend scheme. Green New Dealers have taken a different, less market-focused approach, combining clean power mandates that would force a shift away from carbon, massive government spending and industrial policy designed to create jobs, and a strong emphasis on environmental justice for communities hardest hit by pollution. Instead of putting a price on CO2 and letting capitalism do its magic, the new generation of climate hawks want to force power companies and other emitters to abandon fossil fuels while using the federal purse to put people to work and reinvent the American economy. Biden""s primary season climate plan included some of those pillars, and even referred to the Green New Deal as a ""crucial framework,"" but the new version adopts it much more fully. The candidate""s original platform called for $1.7 trillion in spending over 10 years, and set a goal of zero net emissions by 2050. The new edition ups the price tag to $2 trillion over four years (there""s your massive spending), and aims to scrub carbon from the electricity sector by 2035 using a clean energy standard for utilities (there""s your mandate). Biden has also rolled out a ""made-in-America"" economic plan that would use gobs of government procurement and R&D funding to build up domestic sectors like renewable batteries and electric vehicles (there""s your industrial policy). And the campaign has outlined an extensive proposal to ""secure environmental justice"" by directing 40 percent of its climate spending to disadvantaged communities. Biden is borrowing some of his new ideas directly from Washington Governor Jay Inslee, whose short presidential run made him a folk hero to climate hawks. The proposal to achieve clean electricity by 2035 comes from Inslee . So does Biden""s call for to create a Civilian Climate Corps that would work on restoration and resilience projects, a direct nod to Franklin Roosevelt""s original New Deal-era Civilian Conservation Corps. As writers like Vox""s Dave Roberts have noted , Inslee""s campaign essentially wrote a a nuts-and-bolts ""instruction manual"" for achieving the Green New Deal""s climate goals, even if he didn""t quite use the name. Now, the former veep appears to be reading from it. ""Basically, Joe Biden endorsed a Green New Deal in our view, substantively,"" Julian Brave NoiseCat, the vice president of strategy and policy at the progressive polling and policy shop Data for Progress, told me. (His outfit was among the first to outline what a Green New Deal might actually look like, releasing a plan in September 2018.) Other left-wing groups haven""t gone quite that far, in part because Biden""s plan doesn""t adopt some of their more absolutist stances on energy. Unlike his former opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders , for instance, Biden wouldn""t ban natural gas and oil fracking or phase out nuclear power, and he leaves the door open to carbon capture technology, which some environmentalists see as distracting techno-optimism, and a lot of others think will be absolutely essential if we want to keep the planet from frying . Also, on the list of differences: AOC and Sen. Ed Markey wanted to move the country to clean energy in 10 years, whereas Biden""s timeline is longer and more realistic. And, of course, he isn""t signing on to Medicare for All. But activists are still clearly happy with Biden""s leftward shift. The Sunrise Movement, the youth activist organization closely associated with the Green New Deal, issued an approving statement that took credit for teaching Joe Bide to ""talk the talk"" on climate, and promised to make him ""walk the walk."" The group had previously given Biden""s climate plan an ""F"" grade during the Democratic primary. Statement from @sunrisemvmt 's @VarshPrakash on Biden's clean energy plan (bolding is mine) https://t.co/XHhLKyvs4t  pic.twitter.com/7zvah8QTuu What""s important about all of this, in the end, is that the activist wing of the Democratic party and its temperamentally moderate presidential nominee now appear to be closely aligned when it comes to their core approach to economic and climate policy. While Biden was getting ready to give his climate speech Tuesday, I happened to be talking with one of his longtime economic advisers, Jared Bernstein. I asked what part of his agenda Biden was most excited about. ""I think what gets him particularly excited is doing something in the clean energy space that also helps domestic manufacturers, so that you""re doing well by doing good,"" Bernstein told me. What""s more, talking the talk comes extremely naturally to Biden. The Green New Deal, in the end, is meant to connect job creation and climate policy in the minds of voters.  Adopting it as a keystone of his campaign gives Biden an excuse rhapsodize about bringing back well-paying blue collar jobs. ""Look, these aren""t pie in the sky dreams,"" he said in his speech Tuesday. ""These are actionable policies that we can get to work on right away."" ""When Donald Trump thinks about renewable energy, he sees windmills somehow causing cancer,"" Biden told the crowd. ""When I think about these windmills, I see American manufacturing, American workers rising to dominate the global markets. I see steel that will be needed for those windmill platforms, towers and ladders which could be made in small manufacturers. I see the union-certified men and women who will manufacture and install it all. I see the ports that will come back to life—the longshoremen and the shipbuilders and the communities they support.""

slate|"Near the end of Thursday night""s Democratic primary debate, moderator Linsey Davis asked former Vice President Joe Biden a question. Joe Biden then, according to the conventions of debate, was supposed to respond to that question. Here is that question: Linsey Davis: Mr. Vice President, I want to talk to you about inequality in schools and race. In a conversation about how to deal with segregation in schools back in 1975, you told a reporter, ""I don""t feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather. I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation, and I""ll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago."" You said that some 40 years ago, but as you stand here tonight, what responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country? And here is the leading Democratic presidential candidate""s answer, in full: Joe Biden: Well, they have to deal with the … Look, there is institutional segregation in this country. And from the time I got involved, I started dealing with that. Redlining, banks, making sure that we are in a position where— Look, we talk about education. I propose that what we take is those very poor schools, the Title 1 schools, triple the amount of money we spend from $15 to $45 billion a year. Give every single teacher a raise to the equal of … A raise of getting out of the $60,000 level.

The problems that come from home, we need… We have one school psychologist for every 1,500 kids in America today. It""s crazy. The teachers are required—I""m married to a teacher. My deceased wife is a teacher. They have every problem coming to them. Make sure that every single child does, in fact, have three, four, and five-year-olds go to school. School!

slate|"Seven women have now accused Joe Biden of touching them in an overly familiar way that made them feel uncomfortable or embarrassed. Biden released a video on Wednesday saying that he hugged people or grabbed their shoulders because of a desire to ""make a human connection"" and comfort people in times of stress or hardship. He said he would try to be more ""mindful and respectful of people""s personal space"" because ""social norms are changing."" Even though it appears his defense will appease his base —and several women who experienced such intimate physical contact from Biden have come forward to defend his ""affectionate"" style of engaging with acquaintances and strangers—three more women have come forward since the video to accuse him of touching them in a way that left them feeling uncomfortable. Here is the complete list of the accusations against Biden. Lucy Flores In an essay for the Cut , Flores wrote that when she was running as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor of Nevada, Biden came up to her and placed his hands on her shoulders just before she went onstage to talk at a campaign event. ""I felt him get closer to me from behind,"" she wrote. ""He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified. … He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn""t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused."" The encounter left her feeling ashamed, confused, and demeaned at what was meant to be an important career moment for her, she wrote. Amy Lappos In an interview with the Hartford Courant on Monday, a former congressional aide to Rep. Jim Himes said she had been a volunteer at a 2009 fundraiser when Biden approached her. ""It wasn""t sexual, but he did grab me by the head,"" Lappos said. ""He put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me. When he was pulling me in, I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth."" Lappos told the Courant she felt Biden had crossed ""a line of respect"" in a sexist way. She told the New York Times she spoke out because she was disappointed in the public reaction to Flores"" allegations. ""Uninvited affection is not okay,"" she said. ""Objectifying women is not okay."" Caitlyn Caruso The next day, Caruso, a sexual assault survivor who met Biden three years ago when she was a 19-year-old college student at an event related to sexual assault at the University of Nevada–Las Vegas, told the New York Times about her experience with Biden. She said Biden ""rested his hand on her thigh—even as she squirmed in her seat to show her discomfort—and hugged her ""just a little bit too long,"" "" according to the Times. She told the Times that she did not say anything publicly because she just thought it was ""how men act."" But she had just shared her story of sexual assault and felt Biden had failed to understand her need for boundaries, she said. D.J. Hill In the same article, the Times interviewed a writer who met Biden at a 2012 fundraising event in Minneapolis. She told the Times that Biden had placed his hand on her shoulder before dropping it down to her back, making her ""very uncomfortable."" Speaking on Fox News on Wednesday, she called for a zero tolerance policy on invading personal space and said she had come forward because she wanted to see a ""cultural change."" Vail Kohnert-Yount In 2013, she was a White House intern, standing aside at the exit of the West Wing""s basement to allow the vice president to move through, when she met Biden. According to Kohnert-Yount, Biden introduced himself and shook her hand. ""He then put his hand on the back of my head and pressed his forehead to my forehead while he talked to me,"" she told the Washington Post in an article published early Thursday. ""I was so shocked that it was hard to focus on what he was saying. I remember he told me I was a ""pretty girl."" "" She told the Post that even though she did not consider the interaction sexual harassment, she had felt embarrassed that Biden had commented on her appearance. She said she thought Biden""s intentions were good but that it amounted to ""the kind of inappropriate behavior that makes many women feel uncomfortable and unequal in the workplace."" Sofie Karasek In the same article, Karasek, one of 51 sexual assault victims who appeared with Lady Gaga onstage at the Oscars, said that she met Biden after the ceremony and told him the story of a college student who died by suicide after being sexually assaulted. Biden, in response, held her hands and placed his forehead against hers in a gesture others told the Post was a common one for the former vice president. Karasek told the Post that she appreciated that Biden was making a gesture of support but felt that he had inappropriately invaded her personal space at an emotionally charged moment. ""He emphasized that he wants to connect with people and, of course, that""s important,"" she said. ""But too often it doesn""t matter how the woman feels about it, or they just assume that they""re fine with it."" Ally Coll Coll said she had been a Democratic staffer in 2008 when she was introduced to Biden at a reception. She told the Post that Biden complimented her smile and held her shoulders ""for a beat too long."" She said she felt uncomfortable at the time but ignored it because of her excitement over meeting him. She told the Post she now thinks his behavior was inappropriate in a professional setting: ""There""s been a lack of understanding about the way that power can turn something that might seem innocuous into something that can make somebody feel uncomfortable."""
slate|"Also in Slate: David Greenberg argued that  Joe Biden""s plagiarism shouldn""t be forgotten . Shmuel Rosner examined the  ""erratic pragmatism"" of Biden""s Middle East policy . Joe Biden""s return as a vice-presidential candidate signals forgiveness—at least from Barack Obama—for having plagiarized a leading British politician during Biden""s campaign for the Democratic Party""s 1988 presidential nomination. The Biden episode merits revisiting because as acts of plagiarism go, it was spectacular, and because it points to other dicey chapters in his life. To know Biden in full, you must appreciate his parts. Biden""s puttering campaign for president effectively died on Sept. 13, 1987, when the New York Times "" Maureen Dowd  reported that he had pinched major elements of a recent and celebrated speech by Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock. That speech, included in this May 1987 Labor Party broadcast , begins at the 7:23 mark. But Biden didn""t merely borrow words and phrasings from Kinnock, which is a time-honored practice of candidates and their speechwriters and is almost never regarded as plagiarism. He became Kinnock, as David Greenberg writes today , claiming things about himself and his family that were untrue and that he knew to be untrue.  In his closing remarks at an Aug. 23, 1987, debate at the Iowa State Fair * , Biden said: Biden then gestured to his wife and continued: Kinnock had said: Pointing to his wife, Kinnock said: And so on and so on. Biden quit the campaign before the month was over, erecting the strangest defense as he went out. Most plagiarists claim victimhood: The purloined material accidentally slipped into their notes or personal and professional pressure distracted them. But Biden knew from the beginning that the material and anecdotes were not his. In a Sept. 23, 1987, MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour appearance, Biden adviser John Marttila defended his candidate by stating that Biden ""must have spoken about Kinnock in the past month and a half—I don""t know, 25, 30 times. And he failed to attribute it on two or three occasions. Most regrettably, it was that Iowa television."" Reporters confirmed that Biden had repeatedly cited Kinnock as the source before abducting the Kinnock persona at the state fair. That didn""t make the abduction any less egregious, though. Or any less weird. For instance, Biden wasn""t the first in his family to attend college, as he claimed, conceding to E.J. Dionne Jr. in the Sept. 18, 1987, Times that ""there are Finnegans, my mother""s family, that went to college."" Biden had similarly echoed Kinnock by saying that his ""ancestors … worked the coal mines of Northeast Pennsylvania and would come up after 12 hours and play football for four hours."" He could produce no such ancestors upon request. The Times "" Dowd also found Biden lifting Kinnock""s ""gestures and lyrical Welsh syntax intact,"" proof of his intimacy with the source material. The only practical explanation for Biden""s plagiarism is he guessed that being Kinnock on the stump would be more compelling for his audience than merely citing him. And he was probably right. Anecdotes about how a British politician made a success of himself thanks to Labor Party policies would hardly encourage an American voter to pull the lever for Joe Biden. Biden plagiarized because, like most plagiarists, he was unsatisfied with his own, honest material and decided that the payoff was worth the risk. Another time-honored defense of plagiarists is that the incident was a one-off. But in Biden""s case, we know that""s not true. As E.J. Dionne Jr. reported in the previously mentioned Times article, he ""plagiarized a law review article for a paper he wrote in his first year at law school"" at the Syracuse University College of Law. According to a Dec. 1, 1965, report by the law school, five pages of Biden""s 15-page paper were copied without quotation or attribution. Biden""s defense? He told Dionne—and his professors at Syracuse at the time—that he misunderstood citation and footnoting rules. The Dionne piece is especially rich with other Bidenisms. The candidate accuses other presidential campaigns of digging up the Syracuse law school story, but he does not specify which campaigns engineered this smear. If you give Biden the benefit of the doubt—and I don""t—you""d expect that such a calamitous ""mistake"" from his youth would have seared into his mind the importance of keeping his mitts off of other people""s words. That it didn""t speaks terabytes about his character. We all lie to ourselves about who we are. In my head, I replaced Al Kaline in right field, Jonas Salk in the laboratory, and Keith Richards on guitar. But most of us over the age of 12 keep an editor in our minds to prevent us from speaking those lies. If Biden lies with fluidity about the fundamentals of his life, other discoveries must await. But all will not be lost if the Obama-Biden ticket is victorious: Every administration needs a few good liars. ****** Who replaced Kaline in right field? I""m too lazy to look it up.

slate|"Slate is making its coronavirus coverage free for all readers. Subscribe to support our journalism. Start your free trial . Joe Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president on Wednesday while the country he hopes to preside over was roiling with a pandemic, soaring unemployment, and a collapsing economy. In this dramatic time, his was a muted victory. Sure, Biden""s opposition within the fractured Democratic Party was louder than ever—Bernie Sanders"" supporters bitterly resented the ""Medicare for All"" candidate""s withdrawal at a moment when all Americans are at high risk of getting ill and simultaneously losing their jobs and insurance. But Biden""s support remained comparatively sedate. His YouTube broadcast on the day he became the nominee peaked at ""about 1,700 viewers."" This enthusiasm gap is not new. Biden""s success has come despite a muted online presence and media appearances so sporadic that ""Where is Biden"" frequently trends on Twitter. This has been true all along—and perhaps mysteriously, it has worked to Biden""s advantage. While Sanders and Elizabeth Warren supporters were louder, had an enormous online footprint, and advanced arguments and issues that have changed the party, it was Biden voters who turned out in droves in the primary, despite their silence online. This has made the nominee""s victory feel confusing. It demands an explanation that common-sense theories about how political enthusiasm, exposure, and airtime should affect turnout cannot provide. Despite an apparent lack of enthusiastic adherents, an associated lack of funds, underwhelming debate performances, and no clear agenda, Biden floated to victory. The question is why —and can whatever powered him to the top do the same in the general? Back in January , when the economy was still relatively strong, Biden""s poll numbers were high, and coronavirus hadn""t hit public consciousness, I suggested something like this would happen. My thinking then was that there were two theories about what the majority of Democratic voters wanted. One was that, having seen the real situation in the United States laid bare, and activated by the barrage of outrages perpetrated by the Trump administration, many Americans were finally prepared to fight hard for radical change before it was too late. This model presumes that the Democratic electorate had become not just adversarial but revolutionary: It didn""t just want to make a U-turn and undo what Trump had done. It wanted to steer the ship in a new and better direction, with all the work and organizing that implies. This was the pitch both Warren and Sanders were making: Work with me and we will build a better world. The other theory was that an electorate that is exhausted by a president who can""t stop making the country""s struggles all about himself—an electorate that has had to respond to every fresh emergency by throwing what little free time and energy it has at protests, calls to representatives and senators, donations, and organizing—is depleted and desperate for rest. ""In a landscape saturated by the furious exhalations of a president who can""t stop reacting and responding to every new development, restraint might have its charms for an understudied demographic: the American voter who wants nothing more than to tune out ,"" I wrote then. ""With a government unable or unwilling to check or balance itself, the public has had to go into overdrive and react nonstop: People have had to plug so many leaks in this sinking boat that many simply feel depleted. That the plugging of the leaks isn""t really working only exacerbates the exhaustion."" When I wrote those words, we didn""t have the highest unemployment numbers in recent memory and we weren""t losing 2,000 Americans a day to a virus no one understands. People weren""t stuck at home watching their livelihoods disappear and getting news that their loved ones, who they never got to see again, had died alone and afraid, struggling to breathe. They weren""t actually obligated to watch press briefings in which the president jokes about models he""s had sex with in the midst of discussing thousands of projected American deaths. They weren""t forced to navigate an arcane system of loans ineptly administered by unprepared banks in order to try to save their small businesses in the short term. They weren""t scrambling for toilet paper or fearing the disease vectors their fellow humans might be as they shopped for their groceries. They had not considered that the Kavanaugh Supreme Court would reject efforts to extend absentee voting so people could vote safely and instead require Wisconsinite voters to stand for hours in hail and rain in the middle of a pandemic , literally risking their lives to do their civic duty. A few weeks ago this would have looked like a bad parody of voter suppression, but this week, SCOTUS upheld it, and this is only one of a long list of abusive actions Americans have recently had to witness. Despite voting by mail himself, the president has made clear that he will use every lever he has to prevent voting by mail—the only safe way to vote if stay-at-home orders are still in effect this November. Back in January, we had not witnessed the president withholding desperately needed aid from states whose governors didn""t praise him enough. Nor had we learned that Trump—having said states should fend for themselves because the federal stockpile was ""ours""—would order the federal government to start seizing their supplies. Things, in short, are worse now than they were before. People aren""t just civically exhausted now; they are—in a very real and immediate sense—existentially endangered. There are (again) two theories about what should follow from this: One is that people will be more willing to fight to overthrow a system this dysfunctional and corrupt. The other is that people crave relief and rest. There is a generational divide here, certainly: Sanders supporters, being on average younger, better fit the first theory. Biden voters already conformed to the second back in January, and recent disasters may have only bolstered it. Many, myself included, have been mystified by voter behavior during this Democratic primary. It""s as difficult to square Sanders"" clear platform and fervent base with his lackluster electoral performance as it is to reconcile Biden""s lukewarm support with his overwhelming results. But if the challenge is to understand rather than prescribe, it""s not that hard to see why Biden is carrying the day. Biden""s opponents aren""t wrong to say he""s so absent he""s functionally a placeholder—the ""generic Democrat"" polls ask voters to consider opposite Trump. But they might be underestimating that, given some of the political hungers right now, the generic and forgettable might be more appealing than a battle cry for more action, more engagement, and more effort. One factor undergirding all this might come from studies suggesting that negative partisanship is more motivating than positive partisanship. Ezra Klein writes in Why We""re Polarized that this effect increases as a function of one""s consumption of political news. ""Among Democrats, a very unfavorable view of Republicans increased the likelihood of contributing money to a candidate or group by 8 points, while a very favorable view of their own party didn""t increase it at all,"" he writes, stipulating that ""the most-engaged experience politics differently than everyone else."" What Trump""s unceasing domination of news cycles and airwaves has done is radically increase the political engagement and consumption of Democrats, specifically. (Many Republicans have tuned out during Trump""s tenure —including members of Congress who claim, not always believably, not to have heard or read Trump""s latest outrageous statement.) If that""s been radicalizing, and an engine for negative partisanship, the radicalization has not been entirely willing. Democrats hate Trump almost as much as he hates them, but they""re being forced to watch him, now (during the pandemic) more than ever. In political terms, Biden is an inert gas. His main superpower—and I think it really might be one in this landscape—is that he doesn""t come across as reactive. That draws an extremely sharp contrast between him and the president who cannot stop reacting. It means, among other things, that Biden is boring. Of course his YouTube broadcast got little engagement. One doesn""t particularly need to hear Biden speak because he traffics in familiar platitudes. ""This nation has never been defeated when we""re together. And we""re not going to be defeated now,"" he tweeted on what was a historic day for the country and his campaign. I just typed that sentence out myself, and already I""ve forgotten it. But its objective is not to be memorable: It is to be vaguely comforting in a way that reactivates a version of this country that no longer feels remotely true. Its appeal is no less nostalgic than Trump""s, but the gift of it is that one can safely tune out. It suggests things won""t radically deteriorate without constant, anxious monitoring. There""s a second prong to Biden""s longevity, and it""s his immunity to attack. This is, I think, an undersung component of his campaign. Sen. Kamala Harris"" memorable excoriation of Biden for supporting busing didn""t take; her campaign sputtered out and his support in the black community remained solid. The effort to make Biden""s conduct with women matter happened early in his campaign, back when several women spoke up to complain about his habit of touching women and smelling their hair. Not only did he survive that; it inoculated him against future allegations of more serious misbehavior. While there""s obvious intraparty discord fueling the lack of coverage of Tara Reade""s allegations that Joe Biden sexually assaulted her when she worked for him in 1993, the new allegation is having the same strangely muted noneffect as E. Jean Carroll""s allegation that the president raped her: It""s too much, and so, somehow, it dissipates. This is a pattern of sorts in ""Me Too"" cases: Even Harvey Weinstein""s jury, which convicted him of third-degree rape in the context of a complicated and sometimes consensual relationship, didn""t believe Annabella Sciorra""s account of how he straight-up raped her. People don""t seem inclined to believe rape allegations—especially when they come after a litany of lesser offenses. It""s worth saying too—as we wait for investigative reporters to investigate Reade""s charges, and I hope they do—that there seems to me to be a general collapse of optimism that any public processing of all this could matter. There""s an accused sexual assailant in the White House. There""s another on the Supreme Court, sitting alongside a sexual harasser. In a pandemic, people just can""t muster the same procedural energy anymore—even the levels of intraparty aggression during the Democratic primary lost intensity under the pandemic. No one can get up a real head of steam over one more account. Biden""s creepiness was proposed as a problem already, and America rejected it. If the country does have to choose between two men who have sexually assaulted women, this will hardly be the first time anyway. It""s not a pleasant fact for those of us fighting for a more just world, but it seems plainly true that many Democrats bitterly resent Al Franken""s resignation as an overcorrection, and when times are this dire, they are not going to sanction a nominee for sexual misconduct that the other side""s supporters come perilously close to celebrating. But the greatest example of Biden""s indestructability—the biggest attack that didn""t take—was Trump""s own effort to extort Ukraine to ""open"" an investigation into Biden. It""s hard to appreciate in hindsight how colossally that gambit failed, but fail it did. Trump got himself impeached trying to smear Biden! And it cost Biden virtually nothing politically. ""Look, it""s simple,"" he told the New York Times before the Iowa caucuses, laughing. ""They""re smearing me to try to stop me, and they know if I""m the nominee, I""m going to beat Donald Trump like a drum."" I could be wrong, but I can""t imagine that any Republican attacks on Biden along these lines are going to persuade a single Democratic voter. If anything, Democrats ought to be impressed by this quality of Biden""s. Despite his occasional outbursts of temper (which no doubt help him scan as ""authentic""), the former vice-president is intriguingly immune to the personal grudges around which Trump builds his entire politics . Sure, there""s a more complicated version of him, but Biden telegraphs as the definition of a nice, normal guy. That""s why Barack Obama picked him to be his running mate, after all. Despite Trump""s efforts to extort a U.S. ally to manufacture a smear against him , Biden offered to call Trump on the phone to help him deal with the pandemic. The (meaningless) phone call happened, and Biden—whose idea it was—set the terms for the tone and won. Biden calling Trump ""very gracious"" is meaningless (this is what a nice guy persona does for you), but Trump describing his call with Biden as a ""wonderful, warm conversation"" notched Biden an immense moral victory. The guy who insists (bizarrely) that Republicans can change did manage to briefly drag Trump out of the mud and onto higher ground. He just doesn""t seem to take things personally, and while that was a perfectly ordinary quality among politicians at one point, it might be operating as a real political asset in a landscape where the president punishes people who criticize him by denying them lifesaving equipment. Indeed, Biden is obviously considering Harris—whose most famous campaign moment came when she attacked him—for his vice president and speaking of her in the warmest tones . ""I""m so lucky to have you as part of this—this partnership going forward,"" he said. ""The biggest thing we can do is make Donald Trump a one-term president. So I""m coming for you, kid."" Biden doesn""t just rise above. He floats so high you can barely see him. There""s no reading a country, and one hesitates to invoke the silent majority, but judging by Biden""s numbers, an ability to take punches without striking back is a quality many Americans seem to miss. The bar has gotten very low, and Biden is ""nice"" enough that not even Sanders could ever muster the vitriol to really truly attack him. Trump invigorated his base by constantly saying the unsayable, and by being needlessly offensive, performatively undisciplined, careless, bratty, vindictive, and small. He created the conditions for an interesting experiment on the American psyche: Are open corruption and pure transactional venality preferable to the idealistic hypocrisies of political discourse? The experiment has taught us, I think, that the reviled ideals and ""norms"" weren""t purely decorative—flawed and untrue as they might be, they actually did curb some misbehavior. To quote my colleague Ben Mathis-Lilley, who wrote about Trump""s betrayal of our allies the Kurds , ""the world would benefit if more public figures … began hypocritically professing this kind of BS again."" That""s exactly what Biden does—profess that BS. And because he""s known for gaffes—yet another inoculation!—he doesn""t get punished for saying things other politicians might take real heat for. Vagueness is his asset every bit as much as it is Trump""s. ""You""re seeing the soul of America now,"" Biden said to Chris Cuomo in an excerpt published on the candidate""s Twitter account. ""Look at what Americans are doing. Average Americans. They""re not talking about divisions based on race or ethnicity or any of that malarkey,"" he said. (I will pause here to note that it""s very difficult, in my view, to read this as anything but calling talking about race issues ""malarkey,"" but let""s press on.) Biden continues: ""What they""re talking about is they""re reaching out and helping everyone. We""re seeing the soul of our nation on full display every day in this crisis—and it makes me so proud to be an American."" As with Trump, sympathetic listeners will hear what he means—that Americans are coming together regardless of their differences—rather than what he says (that talking about divisions based on race or ethnicity is malarkey). This is all to say that while I don""t understand Biden""s support, he has managed to sidestep (not solve) political problems in ways that defy expectations. Biden""s challenge was to simultaneously defend Obama""s legacy while embracing a Democratic platform that has moved so far left it in many ways openly contradicts it. That he is vague and prone to platitudes protects him from any clarity that might compromise him. His challenge was to run against the biggest, loudest media hog in the history of American politics, and he has met that challenge by barely appearing at all—and by making his appeals so mild you don""t even remember what they were. That might not make sense , but there is a dream logic to why it might be appealing to weary voters. Biden doesn""t speak in the frenzied hysterics that have come to characterize fundraising emails. A Biden tweet asking for donations is almost comically opposed to Trump""s screaming appeals to destroy the enemy. ""Folks, I know these are tough times, but this crisis has made it clearer than ever how much elections matter—and what a difference it makes who is in the White House. If you can, please chip in to fuel our campaign. I would really appreciate it."" I can""t believe this is the strategy in a political landscape based on gun-to-your-head rhetoric. But there it is: The tone isn""t DONATE NOW TO SAVE THE REPUBLIC; it""s ""if you can, please chip in."" The promises are modest but so—and this is crucial to an exhausted electorate—are the demands.

bipartisan_report|"Former President Jimmy Carter, who turned 96 years old this week, has issued a new message of support for Democratic nominees Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Carter""s statement emerged in the hours before Harris was scheduled to debate Vice President Mike Pence in the only scheduled vice presidential debate of this election cycle. Carter singled out Harris for particular praise, expressing his confidence that her readiness to assume the role of vice president and meet the needs of the American people while on the job would be on full display at the debate. In his Wednesday afternoon statement, Carter said: ""We need champions in the White House like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris who understand the needs and values of working Georgians.

That first presidential debate was marked by a nearly endless stream of angry interruptions from Trump, who hardly ever let Biden finish a thought without cutting him off with some kind of belligerent rant. Across the nation, viewers expressed disgust at the president""s behavior. He acted as though he was so self-obsessed that he was unwilling to even hold a remotely stable conversation. Moderator Chris Wallace repeatedly pleaded with the president to conduct himself with decency, to no avail. According to an Axios report that emerged in the hours before Harris and Pence squared off, the vice president was planning to ""target"" Biden over the Obama administration""s failure to secure the safe return of Kayla Mueller, an American who was held hostage and eventually murdered by ISIS. The vice president""s guest list included Carl and Marsha Mueller — Kayla""s parents — who spoke as part of the recent Republican National Convention, where Carl insisted that he believed that Donald Trump would have been able to secure the safe return of their daughter if he had been in charge at the time."
bipartisan_report|"President Donald Trump is a very ego-obsessed individual — to put it lightly. He has touted his recent nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize as if it""s some kind of earth-rattling achievement, although any national politician or head of state can make a nomination. (In this case, it""s a far-right member of the Norwegian Parliament, Christian Tybring-Gjedde, who nominated Trump, after having done the same prior to the 2018 award.) Now, former vice president and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has also been nominated for the 2020 edition of the award. Biden""s nomination came from a British member of Parliament, Chris Bryant, who is a member of the left-wing Labour Party. Like the Democratic Party, the British Labour Party has struggled to gain ground in recent elections. Bryant said, referring to Biden: ""When others have resorted to violent solutions, he has argued that the best force is the force of argument. Because guns can stop a heart but well-placed words can change many hearts, and many hearts can change a world."" Trump and his allies in the federal government have made a show of pushing some kind of diplomatic agenda, but they have not actually done much. One-on-one meetings between Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un went basically nowhere. Recently, the Trump administration announced peace agreements between Israel and a couple of Arab countries, but there was no active armed conflict between these countries and Israel, so the idea of these peace agreements representing a bold new frontier is pretty hollow. Actual armed conflict in the Middle East, in places like Palestine, Yemen, and Syria has continued throughout Trump""s time in office. On Tuesday night, Biden and Trump will be facing off for their first debate. Trump has tried to characterize Biden as ""sleepy"" and senile and therefore unfit for office. Faced with the reality of Biden""s competency, Trump has recently resorted to suggesting that the Democratic presidential pick might be on performance-enhancing drugs. There is no evidence for pretty much any of these claims. They""re all nonsense — although Trump even demanded a drug test for Biden before the first debate. (Trump said he""d take one too.)"
bipartisan_report|"Another round of new swing state polls have great news for Democrats. In a selection of polls that were released by Civiqs on Friday, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden had some impressive leads in the key swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, all of which Donald Trump won in 2016 and which were crucial to his victory at the time. In the latest Civiqs polling, Biden led by 11 percent in Michigan and by 7 percent in both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and in every one of the states, he garnered a level of overall support that was above 50 percent. That level of support bodes well for the stability of his leads — no number of undecided voters can swing a given election to Trump if Biden hits 50.1 percent. #NEW Civiqs/Rustbelt Rising Poll: Michigan: Biden 53% (+11) Trump 42% Pennsylvania: Biden 52% (+7) Trump 45% Wisconsin: Biden 51% (+7) Trump 44% — Political Polls (@PpollingNumbers) September 18, 2020 Biden himself was, of course, on the ticket when then-presidential candidate (and then-President) Barack Obama won each one of those three states in both 2008 and 2012. In 2008, the Obama-Biden ticket won Michigan against then-challenger John McCain by a whopping over 16 percent. In the current electoral cycle, FiveThirtyEight estimates that Pennsylvania is the state that""s most likely to deliver the winning margin to the winning presidential candidate. (Wisconsin and Michigan are also among the top five states most likely to deliver the winning margin to the victor.) As of Friday, FiveThirtyEight estimates that Biden has an overall 77 percent chance of winning the national election. Why should Americans want to re-elect Trump in the first place? He""s sold out the country for his personal benefit. During the Coronavirus pandemic, he has left Americans to struggle.

bipartisan_report|"Donald Trump was not happy with the latest Fox News Poll.  After all, this was supposed to be his network.

The Fox News Poll was conducted after both the Democratic and the Republican national conventions Of the likely voters, over 50 percent view Biden positively and trust him far beyond POTUS on the Supreme Court nominations, the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and uniting the country. The latter appears very important to Americans as Trump continues to try to divide the country at every opportunity. The national poll was the first one Fox News has done among likely voters in 2020. In addition, this was the first time it had added the vice-presidential candidates in the vote preference question. It appeared that both tickets had strong voter bases. Biden took the seniors, women, suburban voters, Blacks, Hispanics, and the millennials. Conversely, Trump led among men, rural voters, veterans, Whites, White Catholics, and Gen Xers. The veteran vote came as a surprise given the president""s negative comments about them. According to the Minnesota Star Tribune: ""A recent Military Times poll taken before the Atlantic""s report shows views on Trump have steadily declined since his election in 2016, and service members now show a ""slight but significant preference"" for Joe Biden."" Shaw said that campaigns tend to be about ""partisan homecoming:"" ""Despite the often tumultuous events of the day, campaigns are often about partisan homecoming. Trump may be benefiting from this dynamic. It looks like Republican-leaning undecided voters have come around, both in the ballot and his job ratings."" Due to the pandemic, most mail-in ballots favored Biden, (71 percent). Those voting in person favored Trump (58 percent). Likely voters felt that Trump beat Biden on one issue, but one that was vital, the economy, by five points. On the other hand, Biden to the lead on other topics: ""Racial inequality (+12), coronavirus (+8), health care (+8), Supreme Court nominations (+7), and immigration (+7 points) policing and criminal justice"" (+7), while the two are rated about evenly on ""maintaining law and order."" (Biden +2). Ninety percent of those surveyed were worried about unemployment. Eighty percent the coronavirus and sixty percent crime and violence. The images of burning cities on cable news have convinced 48 percent over 40 percent to describe protests as riots (48 percent to 40). They blame ""left-wing radicals"" to ""right-wing radicals (39-33 percent) for the violence. Democrats were less likely to call the protests ""riots,"" than Republicans (30 to 68 percent). Ironically, likely voters picked Biden to reunite the country over Trump by 13-points. The Fox News poll was conducted on September 7 through 10. It had 1,311 live, randomly selected registered voters.  It also incorporated 1,191 likely voters. The interview was done by both landlines and cell phones. The margin of error was 2.5 +/- percentage points for both registered and likely voters, which is considered a relative fair margin. Featured image is a screenshot via YouTube.

tpm|"WASHINGTON (AP) — Just as Democrats were starting to count him out, Joe Biden sent a clear signal through his political team that not only might he enter the presidential race soon, he has a strategy prepared that he thinks could win. After months of growing calls for him to run, the vice president""s tide began turning this week after the first Democratic debate, which softened concerns about front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton while obscuring any obvious rationale for Biden to run. But in a letter to former Biden staffers late Thursday, one of Biden""s closest advisers traced the contours of the argument Biden would make, and suggested a decision to run could be imminent. ""If he runs, he will run because of his burning conviction that we need to fundamentally change the balance in our economy and the political structure to restore the ability of the middle class to get ahead,"" former Sen. Ted Kaufman said in an email to a list of Biden alumni. The letter was obtained by The Associated Press. Kaufman, who served as Biden""s chief of staff for two decades before replacing him in the Senate, has been at the vice president""s side for months, brought back into the immediate fold after Biden""s son died in May. He and two other aides have formed a protective and tight-lipped ring around Biden as he ponders a 2016 campaign. ""If he decides to run, we will need each and every one of you — yesterday,"" Kaufman said, alluding to the breakneck speed at which Biden would have to ramp up a campaign after waiting this long to enter. Kaufman said he is confident Biden understands ""the practical demands of making a final decision soon."" Although Biden""s small team has been drafting a campaign blueprint and screening likely staffers for months, the letter to Biden""s former Senate, White House and campaign aides marked the most direct call to date for support for a potential campaign. It came as a growing number of Democratic leaders, including Clinton""s campaign chairman, expressed frustration with Biden""s delays and questioned whether it was already too late. Yet even in the face of such skepticism, Biden has remained actively engaged in feeling out a potential campaign, placing calls this week to key Democrats in early primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire, said several individuals familiar with the conversations. These individuals weren""t authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity. Still, they insisted that Biden had not yet made a final call. In the letter, Kaufman didn""t identify specific policies Biden would propose if he ran. But in describing the approach the vice president would take, the letter drew an implicit contrast with Clinton, who has been criticized by some as a candidate for appearing calculated or overly choreographed. ""A campaign from the heart. A campaign consistent with his values, our values, and the values of the American people,"" Kaufman said. ""And I think it""s fair to say, knowing him as we all do, that it won""t be a scripted affair — after all, it""s Joe."" ""He believes we must win this election,"" Kaufman added, previewing a likely argument that Biden represents the best chance Democrats have to protect President Barack Obama""s legacy. ""Everything he and the president have worked for — and care about — is at stake,"" Kaufman said. Biden hasn""t spoken publicly about his deliberations in weeks, dodging shouted questions from reporters during public events this week. Kaufman said Biden""s top consideration was ""the welfare and support of his family,"" a reference to doubts Biden expressed in September about whether he and his family were emotionally ready to run while still grieving the death of former Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden. It was unclear whether Biden""s renewed signal of interest would be enough to keep his name in serious contention — or for how long. The first filing deadlines for primary states are about two weeks away, and Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders both raised more than $25 million in their last three-month stretch, illustrating Biden""s immense disadvantage. ""The indecision becomes a problem for people,"" said Sam Tenenbaum, a Biden supporter and longtime Democratic donor in South Carolina.

cnbc|"WASHINGTON — The bipartisan infrastructure deal that President Joe Biden hopes to reach with Republicans gained steam this week, after Biden displayed willingness to narrow the scope of the bill to traditional infrastructure items and to compromise on various ways to pay for them. In meetings at the White House with key Democratic and Republican senators, the president made it clear that he is willing to divide his mammoth infrastructure proposal, the $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan, into separate bills in order to pass the first part of the package with bipartisan support in the Senate. ""I want to get a bipartisan deal on as much as we can get a bipartisan deal on,"" Biden told MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell in an interview Wednesday. ""That means roads, bridges, broadband, all infrastructure."" ""Let's see if we can get an agreement to kickstart this, and then fight over what's left, and see if I can get it done without Republicans, if need be,"" said Biden. The starting point for negotiations this week was the $568 billion ""Republican Roadmap"" infrastructure plan, unveiled in April by West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, the ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Read more of CNBC's politics coverage: Even before talks began, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday that Republicans would be open to spending up to $800 billion on an infrastructure package. His remarks telegraphed to the White House that Republicans were open to going beyond what was outlined in the road map. On Thursday, six senior Republican senators delivered the same message to Biden at a key meeting, led by Moore Capito. At the outset, Biden said that he was ""prepared to compromise."" The senators were ready to talk nuts and bolts. The senators attending the Oval Office meeting all serve as ranking members on committees with jurisdiction over infrastructure. In addition to Moore Capito, the meeting included Sens. John Barrasso of Wyoming, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Roger Wicker of Mississippi. Over the course of 90 minutes, Moore Capito said, the group discussed specific infrastructure items and Biden asked them to return next week with a revised offer that he could then counter. The White House said Friday that Biden expects the GOP counterproposal by Tuesday. ""We're very encouraged, we feel very committed to the bipartisanship that we think this infrastructure package can carry forward,"" she added. As Republicans prepare a second offer in the coming days to deliver to Biden, there's a growing acceptance among Democratic lawmakers of Biden's preference for passing a trimmed-down, bipartisan infrastructure bill first and then a much bigger domestic spending bill, likely without Republican votes, after that. In addition to passing what had been left out of the American Jobs Plan, Democrats would also look to incorporate the second part of Biden's domestic agenda, the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan , into a bill they would pass on a straight party-line vote. This second piece includes funding for two years of free universal pre-K and two years of free community college, subsidizing child care for middle-class families and expanding paid family leave and child tax credits. This is also where tax increases on both corporations and the wealthiest Americans would most likely be enacted. ""From the Democrats' point of view, what doesn't happen now will happen later,"" said Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank. ""They'll be able to take a big win on this bipartisan deal and then pass the rest of the agenda later this year on budget reconciliation."" ""A year from now, what the public will remember is that Biden led off with a bipartisan infrastructure deal,"" said Bennett. ""No one's going to say, 'Well, this bit of spending was in the bipartisan bill, and that bit was in the reconciliation bill. It's all going to be Biden's agenda."" As Democrats gradually get used to the idea of a bipartisan deal first and a bigger bill later, it also becomes easier for the White House to compromise on its initial plan to use corporate tax hikes to pay for much of the infrastructure spending. In its place, Democrats are increasingly open to paying for a pared-down infrastructure plan through a mix of revenue generators, including user fees and bonds. On Thursday, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., told Axios that user fees ""have to be part of the mix."" User fees remain a sticking point, though. The White House said Friday that Biden would consider user fees a violation of his pledge not to raise taxes on those making less than $400,000 a year. Avoiding a corporate tax increase would have the advantage of all but guaranteeing that the bill would win support from key industry groups, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers. Jay Timmons, CEO of NAM, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Friday that his members strongly support Biden's plan to invest heavily in infrastructure . But he said raising the corporate tax rate would do more harm than good. ""We've presented other options,"" said Timmons, ""such as public-private partnerships, user fees, and bonds for the financing of very large infrastructure investments."" Stepping back, it's possible to see the outlines of what a compromise bill might look like, provided both Democrats and Republicans can continue moving closer to one another's priorities. This means that Republicans keep increasing the size and scope of their offer, Biden agrees to limit the bill to hard infrastructure only, and Democrats agree to fund it by some other means. Both Biden and Republicans say they want to move swiftly, and they've set Memorial Day as an informal deadline for making real progress. That's in a little more than two weeks."

The senators attending the Oval Office meeting all serve as ranking members on committees with jurisdiction over infrastructure. In addition to Moore Capito, the meeting included Sens. John Barrasso of Wyoming, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Pennsylvania's Pat Toomey and Roger Wicker, Mississippi's senior senator. ""It was great to be back with so many of the colleagues who I served with in the Senate, and I am very optimistic that we can reach a reasonable agreement,"" Biden said at a Rose Garden event following the meeting. ""We didn't compromise on anything, what we did was, I laid out what I thought we should be doing, and how it should be paid for, and my colleagues in the Senate came back to me and said they'll come back with a counteroffer of what they are prepared to do, and how to fund it, and then we'll talk again next week,"" said Biden. There are reasons to be cautiously optimistic that Biden, a consummate dealmaker, can reach an agreement with Republicans on some infrastructure proposals, especially if he agrees to split the massive $1.8 trillion American Jobs Plan package into two or more separate bills. Following the meeting, Moore Capito also said the two sides had made genuine progress. She said Biden had asked the Republicans to rework an earlier counteroffer they made to his American Jobs Plan, and bring it back to him so he could make his own counteroffer. ""We had a very productive meeting, more than courteous give and take,"" she said. ""We did talk specifics, and the president has asked us to come back and rework an offer so that he can then react to that and then reoffer to us. We're very encouraged, we feel very committed to the bipartisanship that we think this infrastructure package can carry forward."" Blunt said it was ""a really positive meeting... I think we'll be able to go back the first of the week with another offer, and I believe he will make a counteroffer to that. And we all know we need to move pretty quickly here."" In a statement, Toomey that he believes, ""Congress and the Biden administration can come together and enact a bipartisan bill that responsibly boosts federal support for our roads, bridges, ports, and airports."" But there remain major disagreements over core elements of an infrastructure bill, including what ""infrastructure"" should mean. Biden's proposal features hundreds of billions of dollars in funding for traditional infrastructure projects, such as roads and bridge repair. It also includes billions more in spending to expand the electrical grid, bolster care for elderly and disabled Americans, invest in affordable housing and expand broadband access. Republicans have seized on Biden's expansive definition of ""infrastructure"" to oppose much of his proposal. Moore Capito said the senators and the president acknowledged where they had differences, but didn't dwell on them. ""I'm not saying Biden agrees with it or with everything. That's the point of a negotiation here. He understands why we knocked some things out. If he wants to try to have us reconsider, that's part of a negotiation. I think he got our point. He understands what we think modern infrastructure is, including broadband, and how big that package could be."" Democrats and Republicans also remain far apart on how to pay for the much-needed infrastructure investments. Democrats have so far rejected a Republican proposal to fund the plan through user fees, with White House officials saying this amounts to a tax hike on middle-class Americans who drive. Instead, Democrats propose raising the corporate tax rate and closing loopholes that would effectively mean corporations and the very richest Americans pay for the plan. Republicans say any changes to the low tax rates enacted in their 2017 tax-cut bill are a nonstarter. Moore Capito said the senators did not discuss specifics on how to pay for the improvements with Biden. The president has set an unofficial deadline of Memorial Day for reaching a deal with Republicans, or at least making significant progress on a deal. Thursday's meeting was the most positive step so far towards achieving Biden's goal of crafting a bipartisan infrastructure package. ""The attitude that the president had in the Oval Office with us was very supportive, very much desirous of striking a deal. And I think we were all reflective of that, as well,"" said Moore Capito. If Biden fails to reach a bipartisan compromise on the plan, he and congressional Democrats have said they will use budget reconciliation to pass an infrastructure package on a purely party-line vote, which requires only 51 votes in the Senate."
cnbc|"U.S. President Joe Biden will unveil the first detailed budget proposal of his term in office on May 27, a spokesman said, offering a window into his priorities from defense spending to deficit reduction. Biden in April outlined a glimpse at plans for about $1.5 trillion in ""discretionary"" spending, which represents only part of the budget. The full budget, which covers the fiscal year starting in October, will be the first exhaustive list of the programs Biden wants to expand or cut - from foreign aid to immigration and policing. Rob Friedlander, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget, confirmed the late-May release date. As the economy stumbles to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, the budget will offer a sense of how much the government wants to rein in deficit spending, as well as how it sees taxes and economic growth helping its agenda. But it's merely one step in a spending process as Biden works to muscle through Congress some $4 trillion in spending on proposals ranging from infrastructure to childcare. Lawmakers must sign off on any spending Biden requests. The outline Biden released in April marked a sharp departure from his Republican predecessor Donald Trump, spreading billions across areas ranging from public transit, poor schools, toxic site clean-ups, and background checks on gun sales, but nothing on border walls. But Biden's plans for the Department of Defense drew the most attention. Liberals were disappointed that the roughly-even funding on an inflation-adjusted basis at $715 billion would fail to cut wasteful Pentagon spending. Conservatives want more spending to counter threats from China, Russia, Iran and North Korea."
cnbc|"President Joe Biden is calling for higher taxes on wealthy Americans to cover child care, paid family leave, education programs and other priorities. Yet the plans exclude a policy he vowed to reel in during the campaign: the 20% deduction for certain businesses. Tax experts share why Biden may have skipped the change and how it may impact revenue. More from Personal Finance: How Biden's capital gains proposal may hit middle-class home seller Biden's inherited real estate tax may impact more people than just the wealthy How Biden's real estate tax plan may hit smaller property investors The so-called qualified business income, or QBI, deduction is part of the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act. The provision allows pass-through businesses, such as sole proprietors, partnerships and S-corporations, to deduct up to 20% of eligible revenue. For 2020, single filers earning less than $163,300 and couples making below $326,600 may qualify for the full 20% deduction. However, those above the thresholds may only take a partial deduction, and some businesses lose eligibility altogether. For example, so-called specified service trades or businesses — those working in health, law, financial services and more — aren't eligible at certain income levels. The 2020 income limit for single filers is $213,300 and couples filing together can't earn more than $426,600. Without an extension from Congress, the deduction will expire after 2025. Although proponents said the pass-through deduction may spark growth, critics say the benefits skew in favor of the wealthy. ""It doesn't benefit folks at the low end, and it's exceedingly complex, so it's very difficult to figure out what policy objective it's designed to accomplish,"" said Richard Winchester, a tax law professor at Seton Hall University School of Law. High-income households receive significantly more pass-through income than the middle-class, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities uncovered . Moreover, 61% of pass-through tax benefits may go to the top 1% of families by 2024, according to a report from the Joint Committee on Taxation. ""A tax cut on the pass-through side benefits high-income people in a very large way,"" Winchester added. As part of his plan to make the affluent pay their ""fair share,"" Biden's campaign promise included a cap on the business deduction with a phase-out for those making over $400,000. CNBC reached out to the White House for comment. Biden may have skipped the phase-out because it violates his pledge not to raise taxes on those making less than $400,000, said Alex Durante, federal tax economist at the Tax Foundation. These thoughts align with comments from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. During her Senate Finance Committee nomination hearing, Grassley asked Yellen about ""raising taxes on small businesses"" by repealing the pass-through deduction. ""As Section 199A is a relatively new provision, I commit to studying its impact on small businesses since its inception to determine the extent to which it is helping to improve the prospects of America's small business owners,"" Yellen responded. Plus, with limited eligibility for certain taxpayers and businesses, Durante said Biden may have shifted to areas with greater potential to raise funds. ""There's just not a lot of revenue to extract from eliminating it above that threshold relative to some of the other proposals,"" he said. Other tax experts say Biden's campaign plan may raise significant revenue, however. ""I am puzzled by Biden's omission,"" said Steve Rosenthal, senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute. He argued it may have been easy for Biden to limit the pass-through deduction to taxpayers making less than $400,000, which better targets the tax break and still satisfies his campaign pledge. Biden's phase-outs for those earning over $400,000 may bring in an estimated $143.4 billion through 2030, according to Tax Policy Center analysis ."
cnbc|"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said an infrastructure plan should cost no more than $800 billion, setting down a marker ahead of a critical week for efforts to craft a bill that would refresh U.S. transportation, broadband and water systems. ""The proper price tag for what most of us think of as infrastructure is about 6-to-800 billion dollars,"" the Kentucky Republican told his state's PBS TV station KET on Sunday , again criticizing President Joe Biden for putting what he called unrelated items in his $2.3 trillion proposal. McConnell outlined his desired spending cap ahead of Biden's first meeting with the top four congressional leaders on Wednesday. The president is expected to discuss infrastructure with McConnell, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. Biden will then meet with six Republican senators to talk about a potential compromise on Thursday. One of those lawmakers, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, led a $568 billion GOP infrastructure proposal last month. Capito on Friday signaled Republicans could agree to a larger package. She told NBC News that the GOP plan ""is not our final offer."" Read more of CNBC's politics coverage: The parties would have to settle fundamental disputes to strike an infrastructure deal. Biden, Schumer and Pelosi have indicated they could forge ahead with legislation on their own in the Democratic-held Congress if Republicans — many of whom see blocking the president's priorities as their best path to retaking the Capitol in the 2022 midterms — are reluctant to compromise. The president will also meet with Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Tom Carper, D-Del., about infrastructure on Monday, according to The Associated Press. Democrats would need Manchin's support to pass a bill with a simple majority through special budget rules in a Senate split 50-50 by party. He has expressed doubts about backing more massive spending plans, and said he prefers a 25% corporate tax rate to Biden's desired 28%. Biden's plan includes $400 billion to bolster care for elderly and disabled Americans, along with investments in housing and electric vehicles. Republicans do not consider those policies infrastructure. The parties also back different methods to pay for the infrastructure improvements. Democrats want to raise the corporate tax rate to at least 25% from 21%, the level set under the 2017 GOP tax plan. Republicans are prepared to oppose any changes to their law. GOP senators have floated electric vehicle user fees or a diversion of state and local coronavirus relief funds as means to offset infrastructure costs. McConnell also said Sunday that the existing gas tax could raise money for investments. The Senate minority leader said he opposed ""revisiting the tax bill in a way that creates additional problems for the economy."" Sluggish hiring in April also complicated Biden's push to pass the $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan and an additional $1.8 trillion proposal to strengthen child care, education, paid leave and tax credits for families. The president on Friday said the jobs report shows the need to vaccinate more Americans against Covid-19 and pass what he called ""vital"" recovery bills. Republicans have said the $300-per-week enhanced unemployment benefit set to expire in September deterred Americans from taking jobs. The president may rebut those arguments during remarks on the economy set for Monday afternoon. Several other factors could have contributed to slower-than-expected hiring last month. Many parents still have to watch their children during the workday as schools and care facilities reopen. The jobs report led some Democrats to call for immediate investments in child care — which Biden's second recovery plan would address. That legislation may not pass for months, even if it overcomes hurdles to get through Congress. In a statement Friday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said that ""if we want moms and dads to go back to work as this pandemic subsides, we need to provide them with the child care they need."" Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube."
cnbc|"President Joe Biden 's plan to tax the wealthy may trigger a shift in charitable giving strategies. The administration is calling for more taxes on the top 1% of households — including a hike on the highest capital gains rate to 39.6%, from 20% — to help pay for his $1.8 trillion American Families Plan. Biden also wants to tax inherited property at death, aiming for generational wealth transfers. While the plan faces opposition, financial advisors are considering tax planning with their clients. They say Biden's proposal may make some charitable giving tactics more attractive. More in Personal Finance: Op-ed: How to reduce tax increase exposure with charitable contributions Some couples may face a 'marriage penalty' under Biden's tax plan How Biden's real estate tax plan may hit smaller property investors ""I would argue that the link between tax incentives to give to charity, and people with the desire to give to charity, is actually pretty weak,"" said David Foster, certified financial planner and founder of Gateway Wealth Management in St. Louis. Only 17% of wealthy donors say they are always motivated to give based on tax benefits, according to a Bank of America study on high-net-worth philanthropy. Foster said the No. 1 concern of affluent donors is ""will my dollars actually make the impact?"" Still, Biden's proposal may present tax-savings opportunities for philanthropic Americans. The government offers a tax deduction to encourage gifts to qualified charitable organizations . To claim the write-off for 2020, single taxpayers need more than $12,400 in itemized deductions , and married couples must have over $24,800. Itemized deductions may include limited charitable gifts, medical expenses, state and local taxes, mortgage interest and more. Currently, taxpayers may deduct charitable gifts of up to 100% of adjusted gross income for cash contributions. But financial experts say donating cash may not offer the highest tax benefit. While Congress is still wrestling over Biden's plans, financial experts say it's a good time for wealthy Americans to start weighing options. ""It's unlikely capital gains rates will ever be lower than they are today,"" said Ian Weinberg, a Woodbury, New York-based CFP and CEO of Family Wealth and Pension Management. The proposed higher capital gains levies are prompting tax-planning discussions. Foster said one charitable-giving strategy is donating stocks or funds that have gained value, known as ""appreciated securities."" This technique offers two tax benefits: a deduction for the asset's value and avoiding capital gains taxes on the growth. Depending on the final law, Weinberg said it may be better to give in 2022, when the higher taxes may go into effect. ""If you're still able to donate appreciated securities next year, you get a bigger bang for your buck,"" he said. Foster said donors may give directly to charities or through so-called donor-advised funds, which act ""like a charity checkbook."" Donor-advised funds offer a tax deduction today while simplifying gifts to multiple organizations. Another technique, charitable trusts, may also be more appealing if Biden's plans go through. Weinberg recommends so-called charitable lead annuity trusts for high-net-worth clients. Depending on the structure of the trust, it may offer the donor a partial upfront tax deduction. These trusts offer payments to a charity for a set number of years, and once the term ends, the remaining assets may go to heirs. ""This strategy may be even more valuable if and when the tax rates on capital gains and ordinary income rise,"" he said. Regardless of how tax laws change, Foster said it's critical to review trust documents. Successor trustees, who manage the trust after incapacity or death, may need flexibility when distributing assets to heirs or charities. He notes some trust documents aren't clear on the trustee's authority, which may be an issue as tax laws change. ""I advocate for making the trustee's authority explicit and clear in the documents,"" he said."
cnbc|"UPDATE, 5:15PM ET: Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm just announced that Colonial Pipeline is restarting its gas pipeline operations.  WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden on Wednesday said he anticipates good news ""in the next 24 hours"" on the ongoing Colonial Pipeline cyber attack that has disabled fuel deliveries up and down the East Coast in recent days. ""We have been in very, very close contact with Colonial Pipeline, which is the one area you're talking about – one of the reasons gasoline prices are going up,"" Biden said at an event Wednesday afternoon. ""I think you're going to hear some good news in next 24 hours. And I think we'll be getting that under control."" The remarks came as Americans in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic faced fuel shortages at the pump starting late Monday, which showed little sign of abating by Wednesday afternoon. Panic buying in some states was exacerbating the supply chain issues. Read more of CNBC's politics coverage: ""I have in the meantime made it easier for us to have lifted some of the restrictions on the transportation of fuel, as well as access to the United States military providing fuel, and with vehicles to get it there, places where it's badly needed,"" said Biden. The latest moves by the Biden administration represent what the White House says is a large-scale government mobilization to respond to the crisis, which began when Colonial informed federal agencies on Friday that it had been the target of a ransomware attack. The administration said Tuesday it would direct a ""comprehensive federal response"" aimed at restoring and securing U.S. energy supply chains. The assault forced the company to shut down approximately 5,500 miles of pipeline, leading to a disruption of nearly half of the nation's East Coast fuel supply. The attack on Colonial Pipeline has been traced back to a hacker group called the DarkSide, an organized group of hackers set up along the ""ransomware as a service"" business model. This means the DarkSide hackers develop and market ransomware hacking tools, and sell them to other criminals who then carry out attacks. DarkSide is believed to operate out of Russia, but the White House has said it has no evidence so far that the attack was state-sponsored or directed by the Kremlin. Questions remain around precisely how Colonial Pipeline is resolving the attack, including whether Colonial has paid the ransom that hackers typically demand in these scenarios. White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Wednesday refused to answer specific questions about how Colonial Pipeline and the Biden administration are collaborating, but said the company and the relevant agencies are in close cooperation. The Department of Energy is leading the federal government response in coordination with the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense. A spokeswoman for FireEye Mandiant confirmed to CNBC that the U.S. cybersecurity firm was working with Colonial Pipeline after the incident. The national average for a gallon of unleaded gasoline jumped to $2.985 Tuesday, an increase of 6 cents in the past week, according to AAA. Regionally, however,  the price increases were sharper, AAA found . In South Carolina, for instance, gasoline prices were up more than 6 cents since Monday and 13 cents in the past week. In Georgia, drivers were paying $2.87 per gallon Tuesday, an increase of of more than 10 cents in just one day and 17 cents in a week. A rise of 3 more cents per gallon would put the average U.S. selling price at the highest level since November 2014. ""We are seeing the full fledged panic at the moment in some of the places I suspected we might see it,"" said Tom Kloza, head of global energy analysis at OPIS. ""There aren't enough drivers to take trucks from terminals that have gasoline to stations. We are seeing a lot of stations running out. Georgia seems to be ground zero."" Kloza said he expects gasoline prices to rise, but not spike wildly higher. The bigger issue is that gasoline will be in short supply in the region, since it takes time to replace once the pipeline is switched on and outages could continue. Gasoline in the pipeline travels at just 5 miles per hour. CNBC's Eamon Javers, Amanda Macias and Patti Domm contributed reporting. This is breaking news. Please check back for updates."
cnbc|"WASHINGTON —  President Joe Biden signed an executive order Wednesday aimed at strengthening U.S. cybersecurity defenses, a move that follows a series of sweeping cyberattacks on private companies and federal government networks over the past year. The action comes as Colonial Pipeline continues to grapple with a crippling ransomware attack , which has led to widespread fuel shortages along the East Coast and prompted an all-of-government response. The Colonial Pipeline hack is only the latest example of criminal groups or state actors exploiting U.S. cyber vulnerabilities. Last year, software from the IT company SolarWinds was breached, allowing hackers to gain access to communications and data in several government agencies. The president's executive order calls for the federal government and private sector to partner to confront ""persistent and increasingly sophisticated malicious cyber campaigns"" that threaten U.S. security. Biden's executive order takes a number of steps aimed at modernizing the nation's cybersecurity: News of the president's action came about an hour after Colonial announced it had restarted pipeline operations — though it will be days before fuel deliveries return to normal, the company said in a press release. ""Colonial will move as much gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel as is safely possible and will continue to do so until markets return to normal,"" said the statement , which also thanked the Biden administration ""for their leadership and collaboration."" Biden Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm first shared the update in a tweet after a phone call with Colonial CEO Tim Felt. At the White House earlier Wednesday afternoon, President Joe Biden hinted his administration would soon have ""good news"" to share about its efforts to address the attack on Colonial. The White House said Tuesday it was directing a "" comprehensive federal response "" aimed at restoring and securing U.S. energy supply chains in response to the incident. On May 7, Colonial Pipeline paused its operations and notified federal agencies that it had fallen victim to a ransomware attack. The assault, carried out by the criminal cyber group known as DarkSide , forced the company to shut down approximately 5,500 miles of pipeline, leading to a disruption of nearly half of the East Coast's fuel supply. Ransomware attacks involve malware that encrypts files on a device or network that results in the system becoming inoperable. Criminals behind these types of cyberattacks typically demand a ransom in exchange for the release of data. Foreign governments have also been accused of launching cyberattacks to conduct espionage and sabotage. In April, Washington formally held Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service responsible for carrying out the SolarWinds cyberattack. Microsoft President Brad Smith described the cyberattack as "" the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen ."" Microsoft's systems were also infected with malicious software. The Russian government denies all allegations that it was behind the SolarWinds hack. CNBC's Kevin Breuninger reported from New York."
cnbc|"President Joe Biden spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday as the violence in Israel and the Gaza Strip escalated with no sign that it would cease any time soon. Separately, Netanyahu, after his call with Biden, suggested on television late Saturday local time that Israel's operation will continue until it achieves its goals. ""Our aim is to send Hamas a message that it's not worth sending rockets next time they want,"" he said. ""We will deal with them and no one should take the law into their own hands."" During a phone call with Netanyahu, Biden reiterated his support for Israel's right to self-defense against rocket attacks from the militant group Hamas in Gaza and condemned attacks in towns and cities in Israel, according to a readout released by the White House. ""The President noted that this current period of conflict has tragically claimed the lives of Israeli and Palestinian civilians, including children,"" the readout said. ""He raised concerns about the safety and security of journalists and reinforced the need to ensure their protection."" Netanyahu told Biden that Israel ""is doing everything to avoid harming"" those who aren't involved with Hamas and that ""those not involved"" were evacuated from the 12-story building in the Gaza Strip that housed the offices of The Associated Press and Al Jazeera. Three Israeli heavy missiles collapsed the building on Saturday. The president also spoke with Abbas about tensions in Jerusalem and the West Bank and their shared interest in making Jerusalem ""a place of peaceful coexistence for people of all faiths and backgrounds."" ""The President also underscored his strong commitment to a negotiated two-state solution as the best path to reach a just and lasting resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,"" according to a readout from that call. The extraordinary conflagration in Israel and the Gaza Strip has evolved into an urgent early test for Biden's foreign policy. The president was working in the Oval Office for a periodd of time on Saturday. He usually works from Camp David or his home state of Delaware during weekends. News that media offices were destroyed triggered international outrage and shock, prompting the White House to respond before the Biden readouts were released. The Biden administration has ""communicated directly to the Israelis that ensuring the safety and security of journalists and independent media is a paramount responsibility,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki wrote in a tweet on Saturday. The president of the Associated Press, in a statement Saturday, said a dozen AP journalists and freelancers evacuated the building before the strike, but a ""terrible loss of life"" was narrowly avoided even with advance warning from Israel that the building would be hit. ""We are shocked and horrified that the Israeli military would target and destroy the building housing AP's bureau and other news organizations in Gaza,"" said AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt. ""They have long known the location of our bureau and knew journalists were there. We received a warning that the building would be hit."" ""This is an incredibly disturbing development,"" Pruitt said of the airstrike. Al Jazeera's director general accused Israel of trying to silence the media and condemned the airstrike as a war crime, calling on the international community to hold Israel accountable. ""The destruction of Al Jazeera offices and that of other media organizations in al-Jalaa tower in Gaza is a blatant violation of human rights and is internationally considered a war crime,"" said Dr. Mostefa Souag, acting director general of Al Jazeera Media Network, in an article posted on the news agency's website. ""We call on the international community to condemn such barbaric actions and targeting of journalists and we demand an immediate international action to hold Israel accountable for its deliberate targeting of journalists and the media institutions,"" Souag said. ""The aim of this heinous crime is to silence the media and to hide the untold carnage and suffering of the people of Gaza,"" Souag said. At least 139 people have been killed, including 39 children, in Gaza. And in Israel, eight people have been killed as conflict escalates. Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in a statement Saturday called for a ""full accounting of actions that have led to civilian deaths and destruction of media outlets.""

fox_news|"Presidential contender Joe Biden jokingly called a college student in New Hampshire a ""lying, dog-faced pony soldier"" during a campaign event on Sunday, just two months after he unloaded on an Iowa voter whom he called a ""damn liar"" and days after he dryly instructed a climate activist to ""go vote for someone else."" The campaign trail headscratchers came as Biden, 77, has gone on the offensive following his disappointing fourth-place finish in last week's disastrous Iowa caucuses , well behind rivals Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The student, Madison, of Mercer University in Georgia, began by asking Biden how he could remain competitive in the race after that performance. ""It's a good question,"" Biden responded. ""Number one: Iowa's a democratic caucus. You ever been to a caucus? No you haven't. You're a lying, dog-faced pony soldier. You said you were; but now you got to be honest. I'm gonna be honest with you. It was a little bit confusing in Iowa."" Biden had used the bizarre phrase in January as well, in response to a question about President Obama's broken promise that individuals would be guaranteed the option to keep their doctors under the Affordable Care Act. At a 2018 campaign event , Biden offered some hints as to the origin of the phrase, remarking, ""As my brother who loves to use lines from movies, from John Wayne movies, there""s a line in a movie, a John Wayne movie where an Indian chief turns to John Wayne and says, 'This is a lying, dog-faced pony soldier.'"" But, TMZ first reported that the phrase may in fact have come from the 1952 Tyrone Power film called ""Pony Soldier."" Still, no line in the movie includes the full phrase, ""lying, dog-faced pony soldier."" (""The pony soldier speaks with the tongue of the snake that rattles,"" a character says at one point.) However, in the 1949 John Wayne film ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon ,"" a narrator at the end of the film does say part of the phrase Biden uttered: ""dog-faced soldiers."" It is not directed explicitly at a character played by Wayne, and it is intended as a compliment. ""So here they are: the dog-faced soldiers, the regulars, the 50-cents-a-day professionals, riding the outposts of the nation,"" the narrator says. ""From Fort Reno to Fort Apache, from Sheridan to Stark, they were all the same: men in dirty-shirt blue, and only a cold page in the history books to mark their passing. But wherever they rode, and whatever they fought for, that place became the United States."" Fox News spoke with the Mercer University student, 21-year-old Madison Moore, after the episode -- and she said Biden had correctly identified her fib about attending a caucus. ""I felt he did give some good answers,"" Moore said. ""It was a little awkward being put on the spot. But he was right. I haven't been to a caucus. I kind of caved in the moment. So he's right. He's right there. But he's right about the black vote, too. I mean, it's very important. And the results have shown that people think he doesn't have that support. So I'm still very skeptical, but I thought he did a good job answering."" Nevertheless, the moment drew mockery from conservatives and other commentators. ""If he can""t handle a simple question from one of his own supporters, how can Joe Biden possibly take on Donald Trump one on one for six months?"" asked Donald Trump, Jr., on Twitter. George Washington University law professor and GOP impeachment witness Jonathan Turley added: ""Hmmm, Biden does not appear to be confining his 'go negative' strategy to Pete Buttigieg, but seems to think it will work with voters. Calling a voter 'a lying dog-faced pony soldier' must be a new voter suppression strategy by targeting your own voters."" Also in New Hampshire, Biden forcefully echoed failed presidential contender Eric Swalwell in dismissing Second Amendment advocates , claiming personal gun ownership is an ineffective defense against government tyranny. (In an infamous tweet , Swalwell informed a gun-rights proponent that the government ""has nukes"" and could defeat an uprising in a ""short war."") ""Those who say 'the tree of liberty is watered with the blood of patriots' -- a great line, well, guess what: The fact is, if you""re going to take on the government you need an F-15 with Hellfire Missiles,"" Biden said . ""There is no way an AK-47 is going to take care of you, if you're worried about the government coming and knocking down your door."" Biden's defensiveness on the campaign trail has raised questions about his possible electability issues, especially given President Trump's propensity for hammering the Bidens' perceived corruption . This past December in Iowa, Biden slammed a voter who questioned Hunter Biden's business dealings as a ""damn liar"" who needed to take an ""IQ test."" The former vice president then seemingly called the man ""fat"" after deriding him for his self-professed sedentary lifestyle, although the Biden campaign said there was a misunderstanding. Biden has stepped up his aggressiveness in recent days, although his attacks have been increasingly directed not just at individual voters, but also other rivals for the White House. ""This guy's not a Barack Obama. Barack Obama had been a United States senator of a really large state,"" Biden said this weekend, referring to Buttigieg. ""This is a very different situation."" Biden spoke with reporters hours after his campaign went up with a new digital ad suggesting the 38-year old candidate -- who's nearly four decades younger than Biden -- didn't have enough experience to be president. The spot used a clip of then-President Obama calling Biden ""the best vice president America's ever had,"" before going on to compare arguable successes of the Obama administration with mundane mayoral actions by Buttigieg, such as installing ""decorative lights under bridges."" Buttigieg's team, in response, argued: ""Vice President""s decision to run this ad speaks more to where he currently stands in this race than it does about Pete""s perspective as a mayor and veteran.""

fox_news|"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has defeated President Trump , denying him a second term after a bitter campaign and dramatic, prolonged vote count in battleground states that sparked a flurry of lawsuits. The Fox News Decision Desk projected Saturday that Biden will win the state of Nevada and the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, giving the former vice president the electoral votes he needs to win the White House. ELECTION 2020 LIVE UPDATES: FOX NEWS PROJECTS BIDEN WINS PRESIDENCY ""I am honored and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me and in Vice President-elect Harris,"" Biden said in a statement. ""In the face of unprecedented obstacles, a record number of Americans voted. Proving once again, that democracy beats deep in the heart of America."" He added: ""With the campaign over, it""s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation."" Biden's campaign announced that the president-elect and Harris, his running mate, will speak at an event in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware at 8 p.m. ET. A year and a half after launching his White House bid, Biden secured enough states to put him over the threshold of 270 electoral votes and bring an end to the four game-changing years of the Trump presidency, according to the Fox News projections. For Trump, the defeat comes four years after a stunning upset – when he came from behind in 2016 and outperformed the polls in a victory against Hillary Clinton. But in a statement Saturday, Trump did not concede and instead vowed to continue to fight. ""The simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor,"" the president said. ""Beginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated,"" Trump added. The president has launched a number of legal challenges over ballot counting in key battleground states, with his campaign filing suits in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Nevada as the states continue to tally ballots sent by mail. Trump, his campaign and surrogates have spread allegations of fraud in the voting and ballot counting in various states, although solid proof of it has not emerged. In addition, Georgia""s secretary of state signaled Friday that the state is headed toward a recount, given the razor-thin margin of votes there favoring Biden. Biden, taking to Twitter after the projections, said ""America, I""m honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country. The work ahead of us will be hard, but I promise you this: I will be a President for all Americans — whether you voted for me or not. I will keep the faith that you have placed in me."" And Biden added ""President-Elect"" to the description on his Twitter page. Harris, who will become the first female vice president and first person of color to serve as vice president, tweeted ""We did it."" The senator from California""s tweet included a short video of her on a phone call congratulating Biden. On Friday, the former vice president touted the record-breaking 74 million votes for the Democratic ticket and emphasized that ""the people spoke loudly for our ticket."" Biden highlighted that a ""record number of Americans of all races, faiths, religions, chose change over more of the same. They""ve given us a mandate for action on COVID, the economy, climate change, systemic racism. They""ve made it clear they want the country to come together."" But many Republicans question the strength of Biden's mandate. Trump won more than 70 million votes, and as of late Friday night Biden's national popular vote margin over the president stood at just under 3 points. And while Biden moved closer to winning the White House, the Democrats' chances of retaking the Senate majority remained slim. Democrats did hold onto control of the House but failed to meet expectations of padding their majority. About an hour after the news networks projected Biden""s presidential election victory, he received a congratulatory call from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader. With strong focus on coronavirus since the worst pandemic in a century swept across the nation eight months ago, Biden was able to keep the spotlight on the president""s record, largely preventing Trump from making the 2020 campaign a choice election. Amid national protests and unrest over racial inequity and another nasty Supreme Court nomination battle in the closing days of the campaign, Biden kept his eye on the pandemic and an economy hit hard by it. TRUMP VOWS TO KEEP ""FIGHTING,"" WILL USE ""EVERY ASPECT OF THE LAW"" IN BALLOT-COUNTING BATTLE Biden, who laid low for the first couple of months after the pandemic forced Americans to self-isolate, was ridiculed by the president, who claimed he was ""hiding"" in his basement at his home in Wilmington, Del. But ultimately the strategy worked -- keeping the electorate""s focus on the president's handling of the worsening crisis. Also highlighting Trump""s divisive style of governing, the Democrat pledged to be a uniter willing to reach across the aisle to find common ground. Biden was able to resist withering attacks by Trump and his surrogates over his record in politics stretching nearly half a century. He also deflected a barrage of attacks targeting him and his son, Hunter, that accused the Biden family of unsubstantiated ""corruption."" The road ahead for the president-elect, who will soon turn 78, will be far from easy. He must cope with titanic challenges never faced to this magnitude by an incoming commander in chief. Compounding the enormous task ahead, Biden likely will have to deal with a Republican Party that may be in no mood to compromise – and with a progressive base of his own party that will almost certainly try to push the incoming president to the left. Biden""s victory comes five years after he passed on a White House run, as he reeled from the death of his eldest son, Beau. A year later, Clinton narrowly lost numerous key battleground states to Trump due in part to a drop in support from White working class voters as well as a lack of enthusiasm from Black and Latino voters. But Biden – who""s long been known as ""Middle Class Joe"" because of his roots growing up in a working-class family in Scranton, Pa., and later in Delaware, and who served for eight years as vice president under Barack Obama, America""s first Black president -- was able to succeed where Clinton failed. For Biden, who made unsuccessful White House bids in 1988 and 2008, the third time was the charm. BIDEN TRANSITION TEAM'S WORK UNDERWAY ""The core values of this nation, our standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America America is at stake,"" Biden said as he announced his candidacy for president in April of last year, ending months of intrigue and media speculation. Biden entered a record-setting, jam-packed field of contenders for the nomination and repeatedly took attacks from his more progressive rivals over his stance on the issues and his record during his four-plus decades as a senator from Delaware and vice president in the Obama administration. During summer and fall 2019, Biden was in the line of fire as the front-runner in the race. Biden, who had struggled with fundraising since his campaign launch, saw his standing in the polls deteriorate at the end of last year and early this year, as progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, soared. The former vice president appeared on the ropes in February, after disappointing showings in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, the first two contests in the presidential nomination calendar. But a landslide victory in the South Carolina primary on the last day of February, followed by sweeping victories three days later in the coast-to-coast Super Tuesday contests, vaulted Biden back to front-runner status. Most of his rivals quickly dropped out of the race as moderates and establishment Democrats rallied around Biden. After a continued streak of primary victories in March and early April, Sanders – Biden""s last rival for the nomination – ended his bid and endorsed his rival. Biden entered a general election contest against Trump badly behind the GOP incumbent in the crucial fundraising and campaign organization metrics. At the same time, the White House race instantly was upended as the pandemic swept the nation, forcing millions to self-isolate and shuttering major parts of the economy, triggering the worst recession since the Great Depression eight decades ago. GEORGIA SENATE RACE: PERDUE, OSSOFF HEAD TO RUNOFF AFTER HIGHLY COMPETITIVE CAMPAIGN As Biden was working to unite the Democrats following a bruising primary, the general showdown between him and Trump instantly became a referendum on the president""s handling of the pandemic and the economy, giving Biden a race he could win. Biden spent the remainder of the spring, summer and fall continuously pillorying the president""s efforts to combat the coronavirus and revive the economy, and spelling out his proposals. The president had been raising money for his reelection ever since he took over the White House in January 2017, and he enjoyed a massive early fundraising advantage. As Trump started airing ads on TV in the key battlegrounds, Biden remained dark. The Democrat didn""t make his first major ad buy on television until the middle of June. But thanks in part to a surge in fundraising in late spring through summer, including record-shattering campaign cash hauls in August and September, Biden dramatically outraised the president as the general election heated up -- and he outspent Trump on TV ads the past three months. In the digital ad wars, Biden also enjoyed a slight spending advantage. Biden held his own in both presidential debates – disproving the repeated attacks by Trump and his campaign questioning the 77-year old nominee""s mental acuity. And, Trump""s brief hospitalization after contracting COVID-19, as well an autumn surge in the coronavirus in key states across the country, kept the campaign""s spotlight firmly on an issue that did no favors for the president""s reelection chances. The final stretch of the campaign saw Biden playing offense and the president on defense – with most of the campaign stops in states Trump narrowly captured in 2016. Biden""s closing themes were the same as those he used when he announced his candidacy. ""The heart and soul of this country""s at stake,"" Biden told Florida voters during a stop in Broward County last week as he promised to bring compassion and empathy back to the White House. And, Biden continued to emphasize his goal to unite the nation, repeatedly stressing that ""I""m running as a proud Democrat but I""ll govern as an American president to unite and to heal. I""ll work as hard for those who didn""t support me as those who do. That""s the job of the president: a duty of caring, caring for everyone."" Taking aim at the president""s war of words with many of the nation""s leading public health officials, Biden highlighted that ""we choose hope over fear, we choose unity over division, and we choose science over fiction, and yes, we choose truth over lies."" Biden now has two and a half months to assemble a cabinet and top officials who instantly will have to cope with the biggest challenges ever faced by an incoming president and administration – from the worst pandemic to strike the world in a century, and the worst economic recession to grip the nation since The Great Depression eight decades ago. Biden will be squeezed from both sides – by reeling Republicans who may look to run the same playbook that stymied President Obama and Biden as they took over in the White House in 2009. But, he""ll also face pressure from his left flank. The left will be looking for top progressives to land leading roles in Biden""s administration, and will be pushing hard to implement their agenda on the economy, social justice, civil rights and judicial reform, and on combating climate change. Firebrand lawmakers on the left – such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York – kept the peace during the general election, but with the Democrats"" common foe now defeated – infighting may soon commence, with the left scrutinizing every move by a politician firmly planted in the center-left of the party. Also hovering over Biden: questions over his durability and whether he""ll run for re-election in four years. The last thing the president-elect needs at the onset of his tenure in the White House is to be collared with lame-duck status. Biden hasn""t ruled out seeking a second term. Asked in August if he was open to running for re-election, he said ""absolutely,"" in an interview with ABC News."
fox_news|"Former Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday called for a nationwide mask mandate to help fight the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. ""Every American should be wearing a mask when they""re outside for the next three months at a minimum,"" Biden told reporters in Wilmington, Del. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee spoke after sitting down for a briefing on the coronavirus with public health experts. He was joined at the briefing by his newly named running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California. TRUMP SAYS HE'S 'A BELIEVER IN MASKS,' BUT STOPS SHORT OF NATIONAL MANDATE IN CORONAVIRUS FIGHT ""Let""s institute a mask mandate nationwide starting immediately and we will save lives. The estimates are we will save over 40,000 lives in the next three months if that is done,"" Biden emphasized. And the former vice president stressed that wearing a mask ""increases exponentially the prospect that if you are a carrier and you don""t even know it, that you will not infect anyone if you cough, sneeze, sing, shout."" And pointing to the nation's death toll from the coronavirus, Biden said that ""a lot of people are dying. We""re up over 160,000 people dead so far."" Biden added that ""when I get occasionally confronted with a person in public about wearing a mask I say look, this is America, be a patriot. Protect your fellow citizens. Protect your fellow citizens. Step up. Do the right thing. Do the right thing."" The current death toll in the U.S. stands at just over 166,000 people, with more than 5.2 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 across the country. On Wednesday, there were nearly 56,000 new cases reported and 1,499 deaths from the coronavirus, the highest number of fatalities in a single day since May. ""That""s what real leadership looks like,"" Harris said after Biden""s comments on masks. President Trump has not called for a nationwide mandate. Last month, the president said he is ""a believer in masks"" but added that he""s leaving it up to state governors to decide whether or not to implement an order requiring people to wear them in public. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Speaking during an exclusive interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" the president deferred to state officials on the issue of masks when questioned by moderator Chris Wallace. ""Everybody who is saying don""t wear a mask – all of sudden everybody""s got to wear a mask, and as you know masks cause problems, too,"" Trump said. ""With that being said, I""m a believer in masks. I think masks are good."" Last month, the president wore a mask in public for the first time during a trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. It was a striking reversal for Trump, who had rebuffed wearing a face covering in public since the pandemic swept across the nation in March. Biden -- who for months has repeatedly criticized the president's handling of the coronavirus -- emphasized that ""it didn""t have to be this way."" He aruged that if the president had acted earlier in responding to the coronavirus, lives would have been saved. ""I hope we learned a lesson. I hope the president has learned a lesson. But again, this is not about Democrat, Republican, or independent. It""s about saving America""s lives,"" Biden stressed. The president has repeatedly praised his response to the coronavirus - and responding to charges that he downplayed the pandemic at first, Trump points to his ban in early February from incoming flights from China, where the pandemic originated. Hours before Biden and Harris spoke, the president said in an interview with Maria Bartiromo on the Fox Business Network that ""we're still in the pandemic, which will be going away, as I say, it will be going away. And they scream, 'how you can you say that?' I said, 'because it's going to be going away.'"" A new national poll indicates that 52% of Americans say the United States is doing a worse job than other nations handling the coronavirus pandemic, with 29% saying the U.S. is coping about the same as other countries, and just 15% saying America""s doing a better job. The survey, by Monmouth University, also showed that only 38% feel the U.S. will be able to limit the impact of the virus in the coming weeks. According to the poll, 40% of Americans approved of the job the president""s doing combating the coronavirus pandemic, with 57% giving him a thumbs down. Biden took two questions from reporters ahead of the coronavirus briefing, but neither the former vice president or Harris answered questions after making their comments regarding the mask mandate. The mask mandate was showcased in a TV commercial that the Biden campaign quickly turned around on Thursday. In the 60 second spot, Biden also calls for increased coronavirus testing, personal protective equipment for all health care workers on the front lines in the battle against the pandemic and more support for schools and child care programs. The former vice president also emphasized that ""we need to protect the populations most at risk: our seniors - vulnerable populations with preexisting conditions. We need real plans, real guidelines with uniformed, nationwide, standards.""

The dustup occurred 17 minutes into the former vice president 's interview on ""The Breakfast Club"" – a nationally broadcast morning talk show popular with black listeners – when a Biden aide tried to end the interview, prompting the host to charge, ""You can""t do that to black media."" FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN MORE TRUSTED ON CORONAVIRUS The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee stressed that his wife had an upcoming engagement, and suggested he would have to go whether dealing with ""white media"" or ""black media."" ""Uh, oh ... I""m in trouble,"" he joked as he referred to making his wife late. Biden and his wife Jill Biden share the same studio in the basement of their home in Wilmington, Del.

But the ""You ain't black"" moment reverberated on social media, with the host retweeting a variety of listeners complaining about it. Biden ""should never say to a black man 'You aint black' under ANY circumstances,"" one wrote. ""The Breakfast Club"" put the question to listeners on whether they agree with Biden: President Trump's campaign, meanwhile, quickly highlighted the clip, tweeting, ""This is disgusting."" Trump senior adviser Katrina Pierson called the remarks ""racist and dehumanizing,"" saying Biden believes black voters are ""incapable of being independent or free thinking."" She added: ""He truly believes that he, a 77-year-old white man, should dictate how Black people should behave. Biden has a history of racial condescension and today he once again proved what a growing number of Black Americans and I have always known: Joe Biden does not deserve our votes."" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh spotlighted a quote from Kanye West, a prominent African-American supporter of the president, saying, ""I will not be told who I""m gonna vote on because of my color.""

fox_news|"Joe Biden wants to be the next FDR . Some fear he""s the second coming of Jimmy Carter. Former President Jimmy Carter is best remembered as presiding over ""stagflation"" at home and humiliation abroad. Taking office at a time of economic distress, the one-time peanut farmer from Georgia failed to inspire Americans and was bounced after only four years. Some wonder whether Biden will follow the same path. LIZ PEEK: BIDEN FLIP-FLOPS ON US RACISM – HERE'S WHAT PROMPTED THE NEW WHITE HOUSE MESSAGE Americans are anxious about a recent employment report that came up hundreds of thousands of jobs short, prices spiking for everything from chicken to diapers and gasoline, and a president who continues to push trillions more in spending while at the same time threatening enormous tax increases. Joe Biden""s White House has its foot on the gas and the brake at the same time. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Meanwhile there are signs that 78-year-old Biden, who frequently appears to lose his train of thought and seems incapable of jousting with the press, will be tested by our adversaries. It is not comforting that Biden has frequently boasted about the two-hour telephone conversation he held with China""s President Xi Jinping early in his presidency; it""s not clear whether Biden thinks that call noteworthy because he could maintain his focus for two hours or because anything of consequence was said. So far, Biden""s most notable foreign engagement was his convening of a global climate summit, at which he weirdly (singularly) wore a mask on a zoom call while pledging a wildly expensive and potentially harmful 50% cut in U.S. emissions by 2030. In response, the leaders of China and Russia promised… nothing. Biden""s political fortunes will likely rise and fall mainly with the economy, as was the case for Jimmy Carter, who was inaugurated in January 1977. Carter started strong but his popularity went steadily downhill. His highest approval rating of 75% was recorded in his third month on the job; his lowest was 28% in June 1979, before the Iranian hostage crisis, the response to which many consider Carter""s greatest failure. In April of his first year in office, Gallup reported Carter""s approval at 64%; by comparison, Biden""s approval stood last month at 57%. The most memorable thing about the Carter presidency was that the economy grew at 3.25% on average, not much below Ronald Reagan""s 3.49%, but inflation soared. ""Stagflation,"" as it was called, devastated the nation. Seniors living on fixed incomes suffered horribly, with their monthly Social Security checks and pension benefits eaten up by rising costs of food, gasoline and other necessities. The economic situation under Carter can best be described by the so-called ""misery index"" compiled during his years in office, which combines the unemployment rate with the inflation rate. Under Carter, the index averaged 16.26, the highest of any modern president. In the election month of November 1980, inflation was above 12% and unemployment was 7.5%. Carter was trounced by Ronald Reagan, winning only 49 Electoral College votes to the challenger""s 489. Like Carter, Biden entered office with a wounded economy but, happily for him, one that was primed to take off. Thanks to the rollout of vaccines, businesses were starting to reopen; $2 trillion in ""excess"" savings, low interest rates, record gains in consumer net worth and trillions in stimulus funds created enormous pent-up demand, priming the pump for perhaps the biggest growth surge our nation has ever seen. What could go wrong? The better question is: what did go wrong last month, when we added only 266,000 jobs, even as experts had been expecting nearly one million? Supply chain hiccups and too many still-shuttered schools were partly to blame. But business owners also report that the extra $300 per week in unemployment pay approved by Democrats in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan are making it impossible to hire workers. When asked whether he thought the extended benefits might have crimped job creation, Biden was adamant: ""no measurable impact."" Biden was equally dismissive of what he described as ""loose talk"" of an overheating economy. Someone might have pointed out that it was his own Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, who raised concerns about having to raise interest rates if spending and prices continue to increase. Biden should go buy a sack of groceries; he might discover what families across America are seeing – higher prices for cereals, eggs and nearly everything else. Concerns about future price increases will only amplify if Biden continues to press for his $2.3 trillion ""infrastructure"" plan and the $2 trillion Family Plan. Carter was viewed as a weak leader. Though it""s early in his presidency, there are signs that Biden lacks leadership strengths, too. Though he campaigned to bring the country together, polling suggests he has done the exact opposite. His greatest failure has been his inability to sell Americans on taking the vaccines delivered by President Trump. Muddled messaging from a masked president and his health officials combined with the inexcusable decision to ""pause"" the J&J shot has slowed our progress towards herd immunity. Neither Carter nor Biden has been shy about criticizing their fellow countrymen. Biden has repeatedly called out the U.S. for its ""systemic racism"" and denounced decisions to drop mask mandates in some states as ""neanderthal thinking."" In his famous ""Malaise"" speech, Carter denounced Americans for worshipping ""self-indulgence and consumption,"" and for their ""fragmentation and self-interest.""

Biden is also asking the DOJ to propose within 60 days a rule on braces used for handguns, which make them more accurate; to propose action on ""community violence intervention""; to publish suggestions for ""red flag"" legislation; and is asking his administration to issue a report on gun trafficking. Biden also formally announced David Chipman as the director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). A senior administration official Wednesday said that Chipman will respect the Second Amendment while he enforces gun laws. ""I've seen with my own two eyes what a bullet can do to the human body ... and I've fought my entire career to fight this violence and to pass reasonable gun safety measures,"" Harris said as she introduced Biden. ""What are we waiting for? Cause we aren't waiting for a tragedy... We've had more tragedy than we can bear,"" she said. ""The solutions exist... people on both sides of the aisle want action, real people ... so all that is left is the will and the courage to act."" The Biden administration is also expected to throw its weight behind gun control proposals in Congress. ""Enough prayers, time for some action,"" Biden said of Congress. ""I believe the Senate should immediately pass three House-passed bills to close loopholes that allow gun purchases, purchasers, to bypass the background checks."" BIDEN ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT: 'NO AMENDMENT IS ABSOLUTE' He also pushed for two gun control laws that would go even further than that. ""We should also ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country,"" Biden said. He said ""there's no reason"" a person would need a weapon that can hold ""100 rounds."" ""We should also eliminate gun manufacturers from the immunity they receive from the Congress,"" Biden said, referring to the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), a law that prevents gunmakers from being sued for crimes committed with guns they sell legally. ""This is the only outfit that is exempt from being sued,"" he continued. ""If I get one thing on my list... give me that one because I tell you what there would be a come to the Lord moment these folks would have real quickly."" Some of Biden's claims during the press conference are regularly disputed by Republicans, including that gun manufacturers can't be sued and that background checks aren't required at gun shows. Indeed, the PLCAA only protects against suits for ""harm solely caused by the criminal or unlawful misuse of firearm products or ammunition products."" This does not count, for example, if a gun is defective or if a gun was knowingly given to a person who is banned from possessing one. BIDEN TO NOMINATE GUN CONTROL BACKER DAVID CHIPMAN TO HEAD ATF: WH OFFICIAL Further, the ""gun show loophole,"" as it is known, is not actually about gun shows. All federally licensed commercial dealers, at gun shows or not, must conduct background checks. But federal law permits some non-commercial sellers who don't need to be licensed to sell guns without conducting background checks. These sales sometimes happen at gun shows. Republicans, meanwhile, have expressed their suspicion of Biden's agenda which goes even further than what he announced Thursday. ""By appointing the anti-gun Merrick Garland as attorney general and nominating David Chipman — formerly a senior staffer at the leading gun control lobby —  to head ATF, Biden has made clear his sights are set on restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners while ignoring criminals and foregoing substantive measures that will actually keep Americans safe,"" the National Rifle Association (NRA) said in a statement. ""Further, the proposals Biden announced tonight could require law-abiding citizens to surrender lawful property and enable states to expand gun confiscation orders. The NRA will fight this nomination and ill-conceived executive actions,"" the NRA also said. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., added : ""President Biden plans to announce his attempts to trample over our constitutional 2A rights by executive fiat. He is soft on crime, but infringes on the rights of law-abiding citizens. I won""t stand for it. And neither will House Republicans. Follow the Constitution!"" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said, ""The answer is not to restrict the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens, the answer is to go after violent criminals and come down on them like a ton of bricks."" Attorney General Merrick Garland also spoke at the event. He said that gun control is needed to prevent further ""tragedy"" from gun violence. ""We stand here today not at a moment of tragedy but in the midst of an enduring tragedy,"" Garland said. Brady United, one of the highest-profile gun control groups in the U.S., billed Biden and Harris as ""the strongest gun safety ticket in history"" at an event last fall. ""President Biden""s actions are historic and they will have an immediate impact. These are tangible and powerful policies that will save lives,"" Brown said of the president's executive actions in a statement Wednesday.

msnbc|"(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NARRATOR (voice-over): A global pandemic with no end in sight, and every government decision could mean life or death. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: If you do not do an adequate response, we will have the deleterious consequence of more infections and more deaths. NARRATOR: Tonight, former Vice President Joe Biden on exactly what he would do differently from President Trump. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Our family members and friends and neighbors are dying while Trump is having a temper tantrum. NARRATOR: But how does the apparent Democratic nominee get his message out in a time of isolation? BIDEN: I`m anxious to go out and campaign. NARRATOR: Tonight, Lawrence O`Donnell goes one-on-one with Joe Biden, and later both joined by Stacey Abrams, a leading voice for the Democrats. STACEY ABRAMS (D), FOUNDER, FAIR FIGHT: I`m working hard to lobby Congress to ensure that we have both by mail in every state. NARRATOR: Her cause, to push for fair and free elections, taking on new urgency in the age of coronavirus. BIDEN: We can both have democracy and elections and, at the same time, correct the public health. NARRATOR: All that, plus your questions. (END VIDEOTAPE) NARRATOR: This is a special edition of ""THE LAST WORD,"" Joe Biden, with Stacey Abrams. LAWRENCE O`DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: When Joe Biden announced his campaign for president just over a year ago, COVID-19 did not exist. But now the coronavirus pandemic threatens the lives of every man, woman and child in the United States. You have heard Joe Biden on all of the other issues that were raised in the several presidential campaign debates. Now it`s time to hear from Joe Biden about the issues that will dominate the rest of the presidential campaign, issues of life and death. If Joe Biden is sworn in as the next president on January 20th, your life and your children`s lives and your parents` lives and your grandparents` lives are going to depend on the work that Joe Biden starts doing that afternoon in the Oval Office, in the Cabinet Room, in the Situation Room. We`re going to ask Joe Biden to take us inside those rooms with him tonight and tell us exactly what he would do on the afternoon of Inauguration Day if he is elected president. And when I say we, I mean you will be joining in the questioning, because we will turn this hour into a town hall of sorts, with questions from you, our viewers, for Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams, when she joins us later in this hour. Stacey Abrams is the head of an organization called Fair Fight, which is devoted to making sure that all voters will be able to cast their votes for president on November 3rd, without any interference with their voting rights. And Stacey Abrams now has the new mission of making sure that you can cast your vote safely in the age of coronavirus, by mail, if necessary. Stacey Abrams will join us later in this hour. We begin tonight with the numbers. As of tonight, there are now 1,422,824 confirmed cases of coronavirus. And, as of tonight, this country has suffered at least 86,179 confirmed deaths from coronavirus. And there is a third number that would be the only number we talk about tonight if it were simply the result of changing economic conditions, instead of it being the result of a deadly pandemic sweeping the world. And that third number is the largest number of people filing for unemployment benefits in the history of the unemployment program, with an additional three million people reported filing today, bringing the total to 36.5 million people claiming unemployment benefits. The unemployment rate is now 14.7 percent and going up from there. That is the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression of the 1930s. And when Democrat Franklin Roosevelt beat an incumbent Republican president in the 1932 election, President Roosevelt was sworn in, in 1933 facing a 25 percent unemployment rate. But he was not also facing a deadly virus that was killing more than 100,000 people, as the coronavirus will surely do before the next presidential inauguration. Joining us now is former Vice President Joe Biden, Democratic candidate for president. Thank you very much for joining us tonight, Mr. Vice President. We really appreciate you being here. We`re going to go straight to this issue of... BIDEN: Lawrence, thanks for having me. O`DONNELL: Thank you. Of -- I want to go right into day one of your presidency. And let`s assume the conditions we have today, because Dr. Fauci, Anthony Fauci, guarantees us -- he has used the word guarantee -- for a second wave. That second wave would surely be breaking in January, combined with the regular flu season. You can imagine 1,700 people dying a day, as there -- as is happening now. We can imagine hundreds of thousands more infections happening throughout the country. And -- and, at the very same time, you have this astronomical, Depression- level unemployment rate. So, your inauguration will be quick. It will not have a parade, if the conditions are the same as today. It will probably take place indoors, maybe in the Rotunda of the Capitol. You will be able to get right back to the Oval Office by 1:00 p.m. You walk back into the West Wing of the White House. The secretary of labor is waiting with the frightening unemployment statistics. Secretary of Health and Human Services is there. Dr. Fauci will probably still be there or will have been rehired by you if he`s been fired. Where do you start? Who do you talk to first? What are the -- what`s the decision sequence? BIDEN: Well, first of all, it`s going to depend on how much worse this president makes it between now and January the 20th of 2021. The fact is that it can get even worse than it is now. He has delayed, delayed, delayed from the very beginning his willingness to go out and deal with this crisis. He`s ignored it. He said it was going to go away, it was going to be a miracle. He wasted an awful lot of time. And I think, as a consequence, an awful lot of lives were lost in the meantime. Coronavirus is not -- he didn`t cause the coronavirus, but he has not reacted well. But one thing you`re going to have to do is, you`re going to have to have, by that time, between the time of being elected and the time of being sworn in, have put together a team of people that are going to deal with this in a way that hadn`t been dealt with up to that point, at least probably will not have been dealt with. One, tell the American people the truth. Look at the science. Put together a board, a pandemic board, like we did in World War II, when President Roosevelt put together a board that related to dealing with how we`re going to deal with World War II. This is a requirement that we have the best people in the world sitting there advising me and the country as to what has to be done. In the meantime, it`s going to matter, Lawrence, whether or not between now and then this president has used his powers and used the organizational ability that the White House has, that the president has to make sure we have enough PPP (sic), those protective gear for this second wave, if there is going to be the second wave, which is predictable, and to make sure we are going to have in place all the tests that we need, all the tests we need, and we are able to track and test, test and follow on when there is an outbreak, where it was, track and trace. All that requires equipment and requires planning and requires time. If that`s been done, the task will be at least easier, it will cost fewer lives. If it has not been done, it will be an absolute, incredible disaster, beyond repair. O`DONNELL: Mr. Vice President, the -- one of the issues you have to deal with in this pandemic, obviously, it`s worldwide, so it`s international relations. China, where this -- this virus began, is still going to be a major factor for you to contend with starting on your first day in the White House. Let`s listen just for a moment about how Donald Trump has dealt with, described his view of China over the course of this pandemic. Let`s just listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: President Xi loves the people of China. He loves his country. And he`s doing a very good job with a very, very tough situation. He is very capable. The country is very capable. It could have been stopped right where it came from, China. And I started calling it the Chinese virus. Could have been stopped in China before it started, and it wasn`t. Ask China that question, OK? (END VIDEO CLIP) O`DONNELL: So, the president goes from saying China is doing a great job to, it`s all China`s fault. How are you going to deal with China? We have -- you have to have some level of cooperation with them in terms of research, in terms of medical supplies, many of which originate in China. But it clearly a difficult relationship to manage, especially with the coronavirus. BIDEN: Well, first of all, the president got it wrong from the beginning, absolutely missed any opportunity to get ahead of this. You know, back in January, I think it was the 27th, when he was saying this, praising China and talking about it not being a problem. We had put together in our administration an office within the White House to deal with future pandemics. They had been briefed on it, they meaning the incoming administration. We had over 44, if I`m not mistaken, people from the CDC in China, in China to observe what was going on. The president brought home the vast majority of them, I think left only four in place. I kept -- I wrote an article back in, I think, the 27th of January saying, we -- there`s -- a pandemic is coming. We should insist on being in China to see for ourselves what was happening, so we could be prepared. The president said, no, no, they`re doing a great job. This -- all this is going -- everything is fine. The fact is that he has not been responsible at all from the very beginning. We lost at least three months of opportunity to get ahead of this, or at least to catch up with it, to catch up with the problem. And so the thing that I`d be doing is resetting that pandemic office in place, number one, making sure we had the CDC, like we did in our administration, forward-based around the world, so we could see these things coming, because there will be more coming. You know, the truth is, Trump was praising the Chinese government and downplaying the threat to the American people, and, as I said, as I was warning -- I was warning the need to get the people into China to see what was actually going on. And the Chinese government`s word, we -- we squandered critical time. And so I just don`t -- and now he`s trying to play this China card. I mean, I don`t know what -- this is an unusual president. O`DONNELL: I want to go to the complexity that -- of what you will be facing on day one, with all those Cabinet members there, obviously the secretary of state. If their nominations are pending, they will still be there. The secretary of state will be concerned with not only the relations with China and all of this, but how a vaccine, once it`s developed, can be distributed throughout the world, because we know, if we don`t crush it throughout the world, it will come back to us. I just wanted... BIDEN: You got it. O`DONNELL: ... you to listen to, for one second, Mr. Vice President, Laurie Garrett, who is an MSNBC contributor now. She`s a Pulitzer Prize winner, has been writing about infectious diseases for many years. She was on this program the other night describing the complexities of the administration of a vaccine, once that vaccine is eventually developed. Let`s listen to the way she described those international complexities. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LAURIE GARRETT, SENIOR FELLOW FOR GLOBAL HEALTH, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS: It requires creating a profit motive scheme of some sort that will -- that brings the industry to the table, without imagining the kind of profit returns they usually want from pharmaceuticals. And that means coming up with agreements with the World Trade Organization and with the trade-related intellectual property agreements, and all sorts of instruments of international law. (END VIDEO CLIP) O`DONNELL: Mr. Vice President, you`re familiar with all those instruments she`s talking about. Most of us are not. The vaccine, if developed, will happen, at the earliest, on the watch of -- in the next presidential term, what would be your first presidential term. Getting that vaccine out in the United States and helping it get distributed to the world would be your job. How would you approach it? BIDEN: Well, look, I`d approach it like we did in our administration when we dealt with Ebola, and we dealt with these other -- we organized the rest of the world. We got the rest of the world to come up with billions of dollars to deal with the problem. We didn`t -- there wasn`t a vaccine at the time. And now guess what has happened? There has been a -- there was an international meeting of all those countries that are trying to work out and find an answer to a vaccine. Everyone showed up except us. The United States was not there, not there. And we, in fact, the president said, we`re the best, we don`t -- basically, we don`t need anybody else`s help. We`re going to have to be in a position to be one of the leaders in the world to figure out how we can make sure that this vaccine is made available first and foremost in our case to the people of the United States of America getting access to it, rural, all people, all people. That is going to be a very difficult thing to figure out how to get it out and around the country. But, in addition to that, there are a lot of nations out there that have no capacity to pay for any of this, and notwithstanding the profit motive. So what we`re going to be in a position of having to do is get other governments to help fund, fund for the rest of the world these vaccines, made available in other parts of the world, because, as you said, Lawrence, we may square it away here. But what happens if there is no vaccine in Central and Latin America? What happens is there is no vaccine in other parts of the world? As we have learned by now, you can`t build a wall high enough to keep out a virus. And so we should be leading the world. And we are once again absent. We`re not even in the discussion. We`re not even in the discussion. What`s going on in London right now, they`re -- in Cambridge, they`re on the verge, they think, of moving forward. If we don`t participate at all, what makes us think we`re going to be in on the deal? We must organize the world to deal with this, so everyone has access. And it`s going to cost all of us. It`s a little -- if I can make an analogy, it`s a little bit like, you know, we have the Amazon burning. And what is happening is, it`s the greatest carbon sink in the world. It absorbs more carbon into the Earth than we emit in a day, every single day and it`s burning. What are we doing? The president is sitting around doing nothing. We should be organizing the world saying, we`re going to raise $20 billion, and we`re going to go to the president of Brazil and say, here`s the deal. We`re going to make sure that you don`t have to burn the Amazon to make a living in your country. This is what we`re going to do. But guess what`s happening? Nothing. We`re doing nothing. The same way things are going to have to happen when you`re going to have all those Europe -- Eastern European countries, those African countries that don`t have the capacity to pay for it. The world is -- in their overwhelming interest of the rest of the world and the major nations of the world, the major economic powers to provide this capacity and has to be organized, organized. O`DONNELL: I want to open it up to our town hall component and get a question from a voter. This first question, Mr. Vice President is from a voter in California. Let listen to this. BIDEN: OK. QUESTION: Hi, Vice President Biden. My name is Namid (ph). I am from San Mateo, California, and thank you for allowing me to participate in this town hall with you. BIDEN: Thank you. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: I`m thinking about that quote from theologian (ph) Kierkegaard that you always recite. Faith sees best in the dark. I find it so profound what is going on in America today, with so many families across this country going through tough times. As someone who has lost a wife and a daughter and a son and knows what it`s like to go through loss, what advice would you give to a family who has lost someone to COVID- 19? Thank you. BIDEN: Well, first of all, you know, the folks who have recently lost someone to COVID-19 over 86 -- almost 87,000 of them now, they feel like there`s a black hole in the middle of their chest, they are being sucked into it and frightened and scared and don`t know what to do. All I can tell them is that it will take time. But in time, what`s going to happen is you`re going to find when you think of that son, daughter, husband, wife, mother, father you lost, you`re going to get a smile on your lip before you get a tear in your eye, and that`s when you know you`re going to make it. And the way you make it, at least in my experience, is so many people have gone through so much more than I have, losing a wife, and a daughter and then a son to cancer is that you have to -- you have to have a purpose. You have to have purpose. Purpose will drive you to be able to get -- to control your life. And the purpose will be many of these people, what do we do to make life better, better for other people? How could we have avoided what happened here? What are the things you want to do? Are we going to do things like making sure those first responders that lost their lives and those are the remainder who are getting paid essentially minimum wage, get a fair deal? They`re carrying us on their back. They`re carrying the country on their back right now, and they`re not being treated with dignity and respect. I think the way they`ll find -- but right now, that`s no solace to anybody that recently lost somebody. It`s of no solace. But what I have to say is they`re still with you. They`re in your heart, part of your soul, it`s who you are. And you`ve got to have faith the time will come, the time will come when you`ll get through this veil of darkness. You really will. But the best way to get through it is with a sense of purpose and realizing he or she is with you. They`re in you. They`re part of you. They never go away, and they`ll advice you and they`ll be there with you. And you`ve got to move. You just got to get up. As my dad would say, you know, when you get knocked down, you just got to get up, just get up. And think of yourself, what would they want you to do? Would they want you to do? They`d want you to get up. They`d want you to be safe. They want you to move on. That`s all I can really say, quite frankly. It`s of no solace to anybody who`s recently lost someone, and this is all been recent. O`DONNELL: Mr. Vice President, before we go to a break, before we bring in Stacey Abrams, I want to ask you about the Tara Reade story. And you served in the Senate for about 36 years. Senator from Delaware, you were chairman of committees. Having worked in the Senate myself, I`m just in my head doing the numbers. You have to have had well over 1,000 Senate staffers between the committee staff, the Delaware Senate staff. Do you remember Tara Reade who worked there for about a year in 1992, `93? BIDEN: To be honest with you, I don`t. Look, let me get something clear. When a woman makes a claim that she has been harassed or abused, and this claim has changed, has gone up, but harassed or abused, she should be taken seriously. She should come forward, share her story, she should be taken seriously, and should be thoroughly vetted. And in every case, what matters is the truth. Truth is what matters. And the truth of the case is nothing like this ever, ever happened. She has a right to be heard but then should be vetted, and the truth ultimately matters. And I give you my word, it never ever happened. O`DONNELL: Let me ask you about a piece, it was an op-ed piece in ""The New York Times"" recently by Linda Hirshman and it was entitled ""I believe Tara Reade, I`m voting for Joe Biden anyway."" And this is an accusation that she says there were no witnesses to this, it happened in a semi- or in a public place the way she describes it in the basement of the Senate. That might sound like a private place but as you and I both know, that`s a thoroughfare, that`s a very busy area. But there are no witnesses to it, so it`s your word saying it didn`t happen and now her version of it that it did happen. What do you say to women who were ready to vote for Joe Biden, eager to vote for Joe Biden but this gives them serious pause because they do believe Tara Reade, and you`re not going to change their mind about that? What would you say to them about their vote? BIDEN: Well, I think they should vote their heart. If they believe Tara Reade, they probably shouldn`t vote for me. I wouldn`t vote for me if I believe Tara Reade. The fact is that -- look at Tara Reade`s story. It changes considerably. And so, but I don`t want to question her motive. I don`t want to question anything other than to say the truth matters. This is being vetted. It`s been vetted. They went and people interviewed scores of my employees over my whole career. This is just totally, thoroughly, completely out of character, and the idea that in a public place in a hallway, I would assault a woman? I mean, it`s -- I mean -- anyway, I promise you, it never happened. It should be vetted. She should be thoroughly looked at and whether or not these happened, look at the story, follow the story line and determine whether there`s any truth to it. And there is no truth to it. I promise you. O`DONNELL: I want to go back to where we began, which is this possibility of a Biden inauguration day in January, which would be in the middle of the second wave. It could be a very dark time. And when we think of inaugural addresses, of course, the one many people remember vividly word for word, John Fitzgerald Kennedy saying, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country. It seems like if you`re delivering the next inaugural address, that formulation is going to be reversed because everyone in this country is going to be looking at you and saying, what can you do for me? I am out of work, I need a job. I have lost my mother. I`ve lost my brother. I am suffering. That is going to be it seems to me a moment where a president is going to have to say what that president can do for them. What will you say? BIDEN: I will say, I guarantee you, number one, I will tell you the truth. The American people is a -- to paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt -- the American people are strong. They`re tough. They know -- they want to know the truth. They can handle the truth. What they can`t handle is lie or lies. I will be level with them straight up. I`ll tell them what the science is as best we know it. I`ll lay out to them how in fact we can -- once we get by re-stimulating the economy and getting people back moving so they`re able to keep their homes and keep their apartments and being able to have the food available on their tables that they need. That in the meantime, while we have unemployment, if the unemployment rate is as high as it is now or higher like it was with Roosevelt, I will tell them the government -- the government has an obligation to see to it that you are held harmless in terms of being able to -- where you live, being able to pay for your medical bills, being able to do whatever you need to do to take care of your family. And then I will tell them what I`m going to do when I bend this curve and break it so that we`re in a position that we`re going to rebuild the country. We`re going to rebuild this country better than it was found. That`s no solace to someone who lost a family member, but we`re going to rebuild it better than we found it. Look, Lawrence, I talked a lot. I`ve been on your program before talking about -- even before I announced I was going to run, restoring the soul of America. We`re seeing the soul of America now. Average Americans doing extraordinary things, risking -- in some cases, giving their lives -- to carry the rest of us on their back, whether they`re grocery store clerks or truck drivers or whether they are people working as nurses or people working as child aides, whatever. We have to right the wrongs that are being exposed that exist now. All those people are doing that are the people that most -- most people did not spend a lot of time. Did not spend a lot of time thinking about, and now they`ve seen how courageous they have been, what they have done. It`s time to make it right. And we can begin to do that by providing a recovery that in fact, will create millions of new jobs, making sure that we`re building a new infrastructure, putting people to work in ways that deal with the institutional racism and institutional barriers that have existed. And I`ll explain what those are and how we`re going to get to it. O`DONNELL: All right. We`re going to take a break here. Mr. Vice President, just please stay with us. When we return -- BIDEN: Sure. O`DONNELL: -- we`re going to be joined in our discussion by Stacey Abrams. Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams on television together for the first time. That`s next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) O`DONNELL: In her last campaign in 2018, Stacey Abrams came with 1.5 percent of winning the race for governor in Georgia. The Abrams taught Democrats two things. One, Georgia can be a competitive state if they can get out the vote. And two, Republicans will do everything they can to prevent Democrats from getting their voters to the polls. Stacey Abrams has used that experience to form the mission statement of Fair Fight, an organization devoted to making sure that all voters will be able to cast their votes for president on November 3rd without any interference with their voting rights. Former Vice President Joe Biden is back with us and joining our discussion now from Atlanta is Stacey Abrams, the founder of Fair Fight, an organization fighting for fair and free elections with voter protection teams in 18 battleground states. Stacey Abrams, thank you very much for joining us tonight, and pardon me for a minute because I want to begin this with a question to Joe Biden -- because Stacey Abrams is here because Joe Biden invited Stacey Abrams to be here. And so, Mr. Vice President, do you have an announcement to make? Is this an audition? Is there -- what is the reason that you decided it`s time for me to get on TV with Stacey Abrams? BIDEN: Well, because Stacey Abrams has done more to deal with the fair vote and making sure there is a fair vote than anybody and she -- I mean, she has a great, great capacity to explain things and to lay out exactly why it`s going to be so critically important in this election. This president already said when they put in the stimulus package the Congress first passed money to provide for mail-in ballots, he already said, I`m not for that, if we do that, no Republican will ever win, or something to that effect. He`s made it clear -- this is a guy who said he wants to defund the Post Office from being able to deliver ballots. I mean -- so Stacey knows what she`s doing and she`s an incredibly capable person. O`DONNELL: All right. Let`s actually listen to what Donald Trump said about mail-in ballots. We have that here. And full disclosure before you listen to what Donald Trump says about this, the one thing I have in common with Donald Trump is that we both vote by mail. Now let`s listen to this. (LAUGHTER) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: So, the problem with the mail-in ballots, it`s subject to tremendous corruption, tremendous corruption, cheating. And so I`m against it. (END VIDEO CLIP) O`DONNELL: Stacey Abrams, he`s against it. A lot of Republicans are against whatever it is you`re trying to do, whatever your next idea is that you think will help get out the vote. And so, they used to be in favor of mail-in ballots. And now here we are. ABRAMS: Well, I first want to say, thank you for having me. And thank you to Vice President Biden for including me in on this conversation. Whether you`re thinking about what happened in Georgia in 2018, when thousands of Georgians were denied the right to be heard, or what we saw happen in Wisconsin, where 52 people, at last count, contracted COVID because they were forced to cast their ballot in person, we know that vote by mail is the safest and most accessible way of making sure that every American can be heard on November 3. The reality is that it`s safe, that there is no fraud of any consequence. In fact, in every single state that has used vote by mail regularly, Oregon for the last 20 years, the number of people who have committed fraud is negotiable. But what is more telling is that they don`t want the voices of people suffering from COVID-19, suffering from a collapsed economy, and suffering from the cowardice of Donald Trump, they don`t want their voices heard at the ballot. But what we can do through the HEROES package is ensure that everyone in America who wants to vote by mail can do so, but we can also create accessible spaces for people to vote in person early and in person on the day of, because, if you`re disabled, if you`re homeless, if you have been displaced by COVID, if you have language barriers, and if you`re Native American, we need you to be able to go into those polling places, but to make sure that there is enough space to meet the CDC guidelines. We have got to get as many people as possible to vote by mail. Every state can do it. We simply have to invest in it and put in the guardrails to make it possible for every American who is eligible to vote. O`DONNELL: The -- we`re concentrating on COVID-19 tonight, because no presidential campaign has ever experienced anything like this. It`s obviously going to be the most important thing that the president faces after the next inauguration. But the world does not stop for the president on all other issues of concern. And Stacey Abrams, in Georgia, for example, we saw the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery. And there is an example of where the tensions, the kind of racial tensions and value issues that actually got Joe Biden into this campaign, according to his campaign announcement, came to us in a graphic and very, very disturbing way. Are you concerned that, in the next presidency, with the president concentrated so much on the pandemic, that it will be very difficult to get presidential attention to issues like the kind of racial injustice that we have seen in that incident? ABRAMS: Not at all, not if we have a president of competence and courage like Joe Biden. Let`s remember that not only was moments of COVID-19 at the same time the United States did. If South Korea can hold the largest most invested election in the midst of COVID-19 on April 15th, we can get this done by November but only if we pass the Heroes Act and get it done now. O`DONNELL: Vice President Biden, before we go to the next break, there is a bipartisan bill developing in the House of Representatives that we discussed on this program that would allow -- authorized funding for hiring 100,000 contact tracers to go to work throughout the United States. This would be basically a jobs program desperately needed and obviously fulfilling a very critical tool in fighting the coronavirus desperately needed. Do you support that? BIDEN: I strongly support it. And a lot of those people are the people that worked the job corps, the people who have worked in Peace Corps and other public service jobs. We know -- we know that until there is a vaccine, the only fundamental way to change the dynamic is test and trace. Test and trace. And hiring these people will provide jobs, number one, but even more importantly, it will allow us to gain control of the spread of this virus. Tracing, tracing, contact tracing, that is critically important and I strongly support it. O`DONNELL: We`re going to squeeze in a final break here. Joe Biden, Stacey Abrams, please stay with us. We`re going to be right back right after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) O`DONNELL: And we`re back with more of your questions for Vice President Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams. Let go to the next question. QUESTION: My name is Jackie Okomo (ph) from Stockton, California. I have a question for Vice President Biden. As an immigrant working as a nurse, we have provided the care for all without prejudice during the COVID pandemic. How do you plan to change the immigration laws to accommodate specialized immigrants towards a fast-track immigration process, to accommodate such crisis? BIDEN: By the way, number one, on day one I`m sending, no matter what the state of this is, to the United States Congress a bill to provide for a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, number one, in the United States. Number two, every DACA student will be able to stay. You realize there are 40,000 DACA students out there who are providing the kind of help we`re talking about right now in hospitals, as nurses` aides, as fire -- I mean, across the board? They`re doing incredible things for us now. And the idea that we treat -- that the president has pitted us against one another based on our race, religion, national origin, we are a land of immigrants. That`s what`s made us who we are. That`s what makes us so resilient. That`s what makes us so special. And I promise you, it`s a gigantic objective of mine to see to it that we make a -- that we have an immigration system that`s consistent with our values and who we say we are, and it does not now. Donald Trump is absolutely violating every basic value we have. O`DONNELL: What about fast-tracking the immigration process for physicians, nurses, other medical personnel? BIDEN: Yes, yes, and yes. (CROSSTALK) O`DONNELL: Great. We need answers like that so we can get in more questions. Let`s go -- let`s go to another question from one of our voters. QUESTION: Hi. I`m Glenda from Ohio. As a Democrat, it`s just as important to win the Senate as it is to win the White House. I want to know why Stacey Abrams wasn`t willing to run for the Senate in order to help the party but is willing to accept the role of vice president. ABRAMS: I appreciate the question. I personally say that -- BIDEN: She`s capable of doing any or both. (LAUGHTER) ABRAMS: Well, I would say this. I think we have to remember there are two things happening in 2020. We`re not only running a presidential election, but we`re running the 2010 election as well. That means we have to think about not winning the White House and the Senate, but we`ve got to win down ballot races, especially winning state legislatures in order to avoid the debacle that happened when Republicans gerrymandered our maps beyond recognition. That`s why I`m not only fighting for a fair fight in our elections and fighting for a fair fight in our Census, making sure everyone is counted so the Republicans can`t weaponize the Census against our people. I didn`t run for the Senate because I don`t believe that every job is interchangeable, and I`m not in politics to stay in office. I`m here to do the work and the work I thought was most important is making sure that we had free and fair elections across this country. I did that through Fair Fight. That we had a census that will count every American and every person in America through fair count, but also to respond to how COVID is ravaging the South. I live in a community and in a state where we have some of the highest infection rates and where we have some of the lowest resilience because the resources we need, the infrastructure we need has been broken. My interest is in making certain that Vice President Joe Biden becomes President Biden because we need someone who believes not only in thinking the right thoughts but doing the work. And this is a man of courage and competence who helped lead us through a global crisis before, and he can do it again. My interest is no matter what, that I help make certain that Joe Biden is the next president of the United States, that we win every election up and down the ballot so that we can right-size our country and move our nation forward. O`DONNELL: Our next question is from Ohio -- BIDEN: And we`ll win back the Senate. O`DONNELL: -- from Edward in Ohio, and this is for Vice President Biden. QUESTION: Sir, if you were to win the election, would you be willing to commit to not pulling the president forward and giving Donald Trump a pardon under the pretense of healing the nation? In other words, are you willing to commit to the American ideal that no one is above the law? BIDEN: Absolutely yes. I commit. O`DONNELL: And this is helping us get in all the more questions, so that`s a commitment. Mr. Vice President, you`re saying that wherever the investigative trail might lead, whether that be an investigative trail pursued by the Justice Department against Trump officials, Trump associates, administration officials, whether those are congressional investigations, that`s hands off for you? You`re not going to say, let`s just let bygones be bygones? BIDEN: It`s hands off completely. Look, the attorney general is not the president`s lawyer. It`s the people`s lawyer. And you remember when you were there with Pat Moynihan. We never saw anything like the prostitution of that office like we see it today. It is not something the president is entitled to do, to direct either a prosecution and/or decide to drop a case. That is not the president`s role, responsibility, and it`s a dereliction of his duty, and a dereliction of the duty as a -- you know, you have what? Whether 2,000 was it or former attorneys general or people who worked in the office that said the present attorney general should resign. What`s going on is an absolute travesty, a travesty of justice. That will not happen, I guarantee you. O`DONNELL: The issue of people wanting the vice president -- wanting the attorney general to resign is over the Michael Flynn case where the attorney general is basically trying to drop the case as a federal judge questioning how that case is being dropped. Mr. Vice President, what was your involvement in the investigation of Michael Flynn and the FBI investigation of Michael Flynn? BIDEN: I was never a part or had any knowledge of any criminal investigation into Flynn while I was in office, period. Not one single time. O`DONNELL: Let`s get one more question in here. This is from a voter in California. QUESTION: Hi, Vice President Biden and Ms. Abrams. My name is Victor Xi (ph). I`m a 17-year-old, a senior at Stephenson High School in Illinois and just got elected to be a delegate to represent Vice President Joe Biden at the DNC convention in August on behalf of Illinois` 10th congressional district. Today, my question is for Stacey Abrams. Given that young people and high schoolers like myself don`t often turn out to vote in elections, how do you ensure that not only high schoolers and college students are empowered in the political process but also turn out to vote at higher rates? ABRAMS: Well, I`ve been working on this since I was 17. I started registering students to vote on my college campus before I was old enough to vote. I was sent as an international fellow to Austria to represent the United States on the conversation of youth civic engagement when I was 21. It`s because I believe in the voice of young people. I know that young people change the world, and not long ago I was one. But what I know more than that is that this cannot simply be an academic conversation. That`s why my campaign in 2018, we had young people at every level of our campaign. And in our work that we`re doing now, from the work we`re doing in southwest Georgia, helping to respond to COVID-19, to the work of counting folks in the census, we are engaging young people, especially college and high school age students. Your voices matter because this world is a world you will inherit, but it`s also a world you have to survive. That means that we have to focus on issues of climate change, criminal justice. We have to make sure that health care and economic justice are part of every single decision, and that happens by speaking directly to you. But more importantly, engaging you and setting the policies themselves. I know that Joe Biden believes in youth engagement because he ran for the Senate at the age of 29. And he knows that like I do that we can`t win this nation if we don`t have everyone pulling in the same direction, especially your generation. O`DONNELL: Vice President Biden, we have seen -- BIDEN: Your generation owns this election. O`DONNELL: We have seen a whistle-blower testify at the House of Representatives today, Dr. Rick Bright, saying that his cautions, his predictions about what were happening, what was coming in this coronavirus pandemic, were ignored, were suppressed in effect. We have reports indicating that the CDC has not been able to issue the warnings that they want to be able to issue. Donald Trump has repeatedly said the sentence this week, I disagree with Anthony Fauci. In your administration, will the scientists, will the medical professionals be allowed to speak freely? Will you allow them all to testify to Congress whenever Congress requests them? Will you allow them to speak to the media? BIDEN: Absolutely -- absolutely, positively. Yes, yes, yes again. Really and truly. It is all about the science. This president is absolutely -- well, I shouldn`t say it. He does not -- he does whatever is in his interest, takes no responsibility, does whatever in his interest, and we have the problem we have right now. And -- and I hope if I`m president that Dr. Fauci will stay on in the administration. O`DONNELL: And that will be tonight`s last word. Joe Biden gets the last word. Stacey Abrams, thank you very much for joining us. Vice President Joe Biden, thank you for joining us. This has been a special LAST WORD. ""THE 11TH HOUR"" with Brian Williams will be up next. BRIAN WILLIAMS, MSNBC HOST: Well, good evening once again. Day 1211 of this Trump administration, 173 days until our next presidential election. The President wondered aloud in his public remarks today about whether or not coronavirus testing is over rated. He said it could be overrated. END"
msnbc|"""Vaccinating America: An MSNBC Town Hall"" with Dr. Anthony Fauci, HHS Sec. Xavier Becerra and U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, along with the exclusive interview with President Biden, aired Wednesday on MSNBC and MSNBC.com at 10 p.m. ET, moderated by Lawrence O""Donnell and Noticias Telemundo""s Vanessa Hauc. LAWRENCE O""DONNELL: Mr. President, you met and exceeded your first 100 days"" goal of 100 shots in arms; I""ve got two of them in here. Thank you for that, Moderna, thank you for executing that delivery. What about the next hundred days? Is vaccination still your number one priority in the next hundred days? PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Yes, but there are close seconds that we""re going to have – that are going to be announced in a couple of days. We have another 50 million that have been put in arms, so it will be 250 million. And one of the things I focused on when I got elected, I said I had two overwhelming needs; one, to get the American public vaccinated, and we had to go out and get an awful lot of vaccinators as well as vaccine to get 600 million doses of it, and we got that, a lot of it, done. And to get people back to work, because, you know, we lost millions of jobs — 22 million, I think it was 22 million jobs. And they're directly related to the vaccine — not to — to COVID-19. So, what I""m continuing to do is making sure we get people back to work and change the circumstance where we get to the far point, where we have at least 70 percent of the American public vaccinated, and my goal is by July the 4. And I think we can do that. We""re close to 59 percent getting (ph) one shot, so I think we""re getting very close. O""DONNELL: You""re coming up against something we""ve never seen before in any vaccination program or any public health program, which is a partisan resistance to vaccination. This is in addition to other hesitancies that other populations have. But there is a partisan resistance, and that is among people, many of whom fail what is a basic mental competency test -- who is the president of the United States? They actually get that question wrong. How are you going to convince them to get the vaccine? BIDEN: They're showing up. All this stuff about vaccine hesitancy; the truth of the matter is more and more and more people are getting the vaccine. And so, I""ve never believed that there would be a large percentage of Americans who wouldn""t get the vaccine. But what""s the best way — you know, you used to do local politics a hundred years ago — what happens? When your neighbor gets a vaccine, your next-door-neighbor gets it, you say, well, maybe I should get it. And no matter what your position was, when you see people in a position where you can easily get the vaccine, you don""t have to go way out of your way. That""s why you see I was on doing some meetings with folks who are providing for example and the governor of Maine, a Republican, is saying, if you want to get a free hunting license, come get a vaccine. Well, people are showing up. And people are showing up across the board. So, the idea, I""ve never believed that at the end of the day, there would be any large percentage of Americans who would not get the vaccine. O""DONNELL: I have a question from my Telemundo colleague, Vanessa Hauc, who wonders, what do you say to people who worry that their immigration status is a reason not to get the vaccine? BIDEN: Well, I say they shouldn""t worry. They should get the vaccine. They should get the vaccine. O""DONNELL: And there won""t be any interactions with government that occur because they get the vaccine? BIDEN: What I have said is that it""s one thing for people who are in country here to have, if they show up for a doctor""s appointment, they show up to drop their child off at school, et cetera, we should lay off those people. We should, and that""s why I introduced a comprehensive immigration bill. There""s 11 million undocumented people in the United States, the vast majority of whom overstayed their visas. We should move about getting that taken care of, making sure there""s a pathway to earn citizenship and get underway. They should not be in a position that, if they're trying to save their lives or their health and they do what""s needed to be done to make people around them safe as well, they shouldn""t be penalized for that. O""DONNELL: You just had a meeting with the Big Four; the speaker of the House, minority leader of the House, majority leader of the Senate, minority leader of the Senate, and it had that external signal, which is always a good sign, which is that it went into overtime, it went much longer than people outside the room were expecting. Kevin McCarthy said it was a productive meeting. Mitch McConnell said it was a productive meeting. But they do seem to be drawing a red line, as Mitch McConnell called it, on any taxes, any taxes to pay for an infrastructure bill, and you have some serious tax increases in your infrastructure bill. BIDEN: Well, look, there was a red line saying they wouldn""t do anything on anything, quite frankly. O""DONNELL: Well, that was last week. Mitch McConnell said last week — BIDEN: Yeah. O""DONNELL: — he had 100 percent of Republican senators lined up against your infrastructure bill. BIDEN: I understand that. That""s — but I think we can have a deal. And there are ways in which we can pay for this without just putting the entire burden on working class and middle-class people. For example, there""s a situation where there""s an estimation of somewhere between $700 billion and a one-trillion-three-hundred billion dollars, if we hire up more IRS agents and we go after those folks who are avoiding taxes at the top end. And that is — I mean, these are serious — this isn""t pie in the sky — these are serious, serious experts and liberals, conservatives, et cetera. So, let""s say it""s somewhere in between; that""s one trillion dollars. I""m confident they would go for that. I""m confident, for example, something that""s not in the, that two-trillion-dollar tax cut for which nothing was paid for, and it ended up being — increasing the debt. There""s a thing called stepped up basis. That""s not in it (ph). Stepped up basis is complicated. I didn""t know what it was; I never had any money, so I didn""t know what it was. But for example, if you have a capital gain, you""re a wealthy person, you""re about to cash-in, you bought a million-dollars"" worth of stock, now it""s worth it""s worth one-million-five-hundred-thousand, you""re going to cash it in, and god forbid, on the way to cash it in, you figure (ph) being hit by a truck and you die, that gets left to your son or daughter; they pay none of the capital gains you would have had to pay. It""s not an inheritance tax. It""s a tax owed 10 seconds before it happened. Eliminate that. That raises billions and billions of dollars. So, there""s ways to do this. O""DONNELL: Mitch McConnell said that he""s not willing to reopen anything that was in the Trump tax cut. (CROSSTALK) O""DONNELL: Now there are — (CROSSTALK) BIDEN: — neither of those were in the (INAUDIBLE) — (CROSSTALK) O""DONNELL: Yes, OK. So, is that where you""re exploring? Did you have an exploration of possible revenue with them, actual pay-fors — (CROSSTALK) BIDEN: No. I didn""t get into that. I got into what constitutes infrastructure. I want to make it clear. I want to get a bipartisan deal on as much as we can get a bipartisan deal on. And that means roads, bridges, broadband, all infrastructure. But I""m not giving up on the fact that we have, you know, two million women who are not able to go back to work because all the daycare centers are closed. They're out of business. And so, they can""t go back to work. I""m not going to give up on a whole range of things that go to the question of productivity, of increasing jobs, increasing employment, increasing revenues. I""m not willing to give up on that. So we""re going to fight those out. So I want to know, what can we agree on? And let""s see if we can get an agreement to kickstart this. And then fight over what""s left and see if I can get it done without Republicans, if need be. O""DONNELL: You were trying to make a deal today in a room with Kevin McCarthy, where what he was doing before he came up here was expelling Liz Cheney from his leadership group for saying things like, the election is over, as she said last night on the House floor. And Kevin McCarthy is the same person who supported Liz Cheney just weeks ago. How can you accept whatever someone like Kevin McCarthy says today as something that you""re actually going to legislate a few weeks from now or months from now? BIDEN: If a man looks me in the eye, gives me his word that something""s going to happen, I take it unless he breaks it. He may have broken his word to somebody else, but to me, has he made that deal — we""re nowhere near having made a deal. We agree that we should try to get a bipartisan agreement. But the Liz Cheney/McCarthy thing is above my pay grade. I mean, I have enough trouble figuring out my own party all the time, let alone the Republicans. O""DONNELL: Are you shocked that there""s just, at this point, one member on the Republican side of the House who was willing to stand up last night and say things like, the election is over, and if you don""t believe in the outcomes in our courts, you are an anti-constitutionalist on the Republican side. That""s what her fight is on the Republican side of the House of Representatives. BIDEN: I think I heard Kevin McCarthy say today Biden""s a duly elected president. O""DONNELL: He did. This is the experience I had working with you in the Senate. I have to let the audience in on this. We""ve known each other 25 years, and when we were working together in the Senate, what I always saw is you take the most positive things someone says in your direction and try to work with that tomorrow. And you try to ignore anything that isn""t part of what you're trying to work with tomorrow. Is that the way you're doing this job? BIDEN: As Pat Moynihan once said to me, Joe, I""m not sure you're Irish. You don't hold a grudge. (LAUGHTER) O""DONNELL: Exactly. That""s right. BIDEN: I don't. Look, it""s too important to the American people. I don't want to sound – I""ll just say what I believe. It""s too important to the American people for me not to continue to reach out to get things done with people that I agree and disagree with. I mean, I ended up making a deal with Jesse Helms for the lord""s sake on funding the United Nations. I didn""t have to give up anything, but I worked on it and worked on it. He finally came around. But if I had said, because Jesse Helms has done all these other things, I""m never going to deal with him — it""s just not the way it works. I don't — look, I believe — how can I say it? My mother used to give me — I believe in redemption for myself as well. But look, Lawrence, I have — I once had a doctor who was — had worked on me because I had had an aneurism 20 some years ago. He said, you know what your problem is? He said you're a congenital optimist. Well, I am, because I know the American people. The American people are optimistic. The American people never ever, ever, ever, ever give up. Never. Not once in our history did they give up. And I just – I have faith. I have faith, and we just got to keep pushing it. O""DONNELL: Let me ask you about the second most powerful Joe in Washington — Joe Manchin, who has become a visitor to this White House, and he""s not there with the Democrats even on everything that""s proposed. He""s not there 100 percent on your infrastructure bill. He""s trying to work with Republicans to bring Republicans along into something that could be a compromise. What about S.1., the voting rights, voting access bill that the Senate Rules Committee considered yesterday? So important that the majority leader and minority leader went to the Rules Committee and — to testify about and talk about that bill. That bill looks like there will be zero Republican votes in the Senate for that bill. That bill also doesn""t fit any reconciliation rule. That bill cannot get through without 60 votes or without an adjustment to the cloture rule, which Joe Manchin would have to agree to. Does Joe Manchin see this road in front of him and what that means for voting rights in America? BIDEN: I don't know. I""ve not had — I've not had that discussion with Joe. I've been meeting with a lot of Republicans, a lot of, quote, ""bipartisan groups"" have been coming to see me on everything from my – the overall bill, the families bill that I have and the caregivers bill, as well as the infrastructure bill. We were at the same place. I don't know — I can""t say that you asked me, but other serious folks in your business asked me the same kind of questions when we were trying to do the American Rescue Plan. How can you possibly get it passed? Well, it passed by one vote, even though up to the time that vote took place there were a number of people saying, I""m not going to do it. But look, Lawrence, I have — this is going to sound naive. I have faith in the American people. The American people overwhelmingly support what I""m doing. The polling numbers are overwhelming — Democrat, Republican, and Independent, the averages. We""ve got 78 percent of the American people, if I""m not mistaken in the last major poll done, showing that they support my — what I""m talking about, this gigantic effort to try to build back and build back better. You had an enormous number of American people supporting the last bill that passed. And look what""s happened — 1.5 million new jobs, 1.5 million new jobs. You had all that money in there for COVID. We""ve now got — we have 250 million people will have gotten shots. The death rate is the lowest it""s ever been. It""s down 80 percent. Hospitalizations are down. And so, I just think with all I — what I have to do is just keep moving forward. Just keep moving forward, and the more we move, the more I demonstrate what we""ve done is working and is right, the more likelihood I""ll have to get it — look, for example, you know, we used to be, back in the old days, when I first got to the Senate, we used to invest in research and development, the things of the future. We invested more money than any — a higher percentage of our GDP than any nation in the world. And China was number I think nine or something. We""re now number eight. China""s number one. What do we think is going to happen if we stand still for god""s sake? What do we think is going to happen if more corporate American doesn""t invest in research and development instead of buying back their own stock? What do — I mean, so, I think this is a matter — this is a bit of — as my grandfather, Finnegan, might say, this is a bit of an epiphany that""s going on here where people are beginning to look and say, whoa, whoa. And I've met with either on the — almost all on a telephone and/or on Skype, with I think now 40-some world leaders. They want to know, is America really back? Are we really back in the game? Are we going to engage? And so, I just think — I know this sounds — well, I don't know what it sounds like, but you know, it""s never ever, ever been a good bet against America. That""s never occurred. It""s never been a good bet, to bet against the American people, and I""m betting they're going to come around. O""DONNELL: I just have one more question for you, and that is, you're 113 days into the presidency. This is the top of the mountain. You were climbing this career mountain for many, many years. You're the most prepared president in history with 36 years in the Senate, eight years as vice president. The one thing you don't have on this 113th day in the presidency is your son, Beau""s, advice, and I""m just wondering what you would say if Beau called you today and said, hey, Pop, how""s it going? BIDEN: I""d say, Beau, I remember what you""d say to me every single time we""d talk about a political issue. He""d say, Dad, look at me. I""d give him my word. Dad, look at me. Remember, home base. Home base. Be who you are. The one thing that I""d hope that he would say is, Dad, you""re home base, you're sticking to it. Some things are worth losing over, old buddy. I haven""t done this, this long than I had now (ph) to do things that I don't — I don't believe. O""DONNELL: Mr. President, thank you very much for your time today. We really appreciate it. BIDEN: Thank you. You always catch me off guard with Beau. God love him. He should be sitting in this chair. Anyway, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. O""DONNELL: Thank you very much, Mr. President."
msnbc|"Rachel Maddow interviews Vice President Joe Biden at Union Depot in St. Paul, Minnesota, February 18, 2016. This is a rough transcript and may be updated for accuracy. MADDOW: Mr. Vice President, thank you so much for this time.  I really appreciate it. BIDEN: I'm flattered to be here. MADDOW: So we are at Union Depot in St. Paul and this station was rebuilt and reopened in part because of the recovery act which you led in it's implementation for the administration.  I looked back on the congressional record on that vote seven years ago.  It got zero Republican votes in the house, it got a grand total of three Republican votes in the senate, and that was after you guys had to shrink it considerably to attract Republican support.  That was right at the beginning of the administration.  You'd just come out of decades in the congress and the senate.  Were you surprised at that wall that came down? BIDEN: You know, I was, I was.  Matter of fact, the way we got a path, a great friend, Arlen Specter, I convinced him to switch parties.  Not a joke.  Not a joke.  He was the deciding vote.  And, but you remember, the Republican leadership had that meeting which I'd never heard of before, where they met before the president was sworn in and said, we got to make sure this is a one term president, and they were going to graft him.  It was like, boom, day one.  And it's had a lousy legacy. MADDOW: In terms of infrastructure, I know it's a passion of yours -- stimulus, recovery act was the biggest public works investment since the interstate highways under Eisenhower but our infrastructure, obviously, is still a piece of work. BIDEN: It's real work. MADDOW: It needs a lot of work.  I mean I lived in part of rural Western New England where we don't have broadband, and nobody can sell their house, but that's OK. BIDEN: Yes. MADDOW: With interest rates at zero or near zero, obviously the recovery act was a big deal.  But, where is the appetite, politically, for fixing what needs fixing, and investing more?  Is it just part of some opposition to your administration or this there appetite out there? BIDEN: I think there's an appetite out there.  I think if we did anything we failed to explain what the act was really about.  It wasn't just about infrastructure.  It was almost -- it was over $800 billion.  It fundamentally changed the way do with energy in America.  We spent $90 billion in Anova (ph) energy.  Now we have wind and solar energy about as cheap as coal is out there. We spent $100 billion on education, saving the education system 300,000 teachers who were laid off because of the recession.  We also put tens of thousands of lower income kids in college through Pell grants which has fundamentally all their opportunity.  We did the same thing with regard to what we did on transportation.  So we weren't' just trying to -- we knew we had to do something big to keep us from going over the cliff into a depression and pull us out of hole. But, we also wanted to change the story -- change the approach to the 21st century on energy, on education, on transportation, on infrastructure, generally, and it laid the groundwork for that.  And one of the reasons I'm doing this trip is not only to say what we did worked, but to say we should do more of this.  And keep in mind, for every dollar the federal government put in, there were $3 to $5 that came off the sideline. This place we're standing today used to have 300 trains a day in the 1920's.  Three-hundred trains a day.  We have a new problem today.  The new problem is not suburban sprawl, it's job sprawl.  You're in a neighborhood here that has a significant minority population of African-Americans, Hispanic, and Asian.  The jobs are out in the suburbs now.  They don't have cars.  So, we have to adapt to the reality of what the opportunities are here.  But of the money, we put in $50 million, they put in $250 million. MADDOW: Put leverage. BIDEN: It's leverage. MADDOW: One big history of the Obama-Biden administration that's written, I think arguably, the biggest achievement of the administration will be pulling the country back from the brink of what would have been a second grade depression.  The (inaudible) act Recovery Act, obviously, a big part of that.  But now, running to succeed you. We've got Sen. Sanders and Secretary Clinton both running for president, in part by saying the economy is rigged.  That it's disastrously unfair for the average working person.  Is that, in part, a criticism of you and President Obama, that however far you took us back from the brink of great depression in 2009, the system still has a fundamental unfairness to it that you haven't been able fix. BIDEN: It does have a fundamental unfairness to it we've been trying to fix for the last two years.  We went from crisis to recovery on the verge of resurgence.  There are $1.2 trillion in tax expenditures -- tax cuts for wealthy people, mainly.  Six-hundred billion of those, there is no social redeeming value for. For example, one way to bring the middle class back is through the tax structure, but also using the tax structure to make value judgments.  For example, we say that we can pay for 9 million community college students to go to school free.  And, by the way, the fact it's 12 years, it's just not enough.  Twelve years of education is not enough.  For 14 years, guess what?  We can do that and still reduce the deficit under $5 billion dollars by eliminating one tax break. It's called ""stepped-up basis"". Sounds complicated. If you go out -- and either one of us should have gone and buy a million dollars worth of stock, we held it for a year and it was worth $2 million, we'd pay a million dollars in capital gains. But, if before -- if I die and leave that to my die, she inherits $2 million dollars worth of stock, she sells if for $4. She only pays the difference (ph) between two and four. She doesn't pay the $1 to $2. There's only about two-tenths of 1% of all the people in America that benefit from that, they're already very, very wealthy, and we would be able to pay for every single solitary student and community college, nine million, and still reduce the deficit by $5 million dollars, even if we just eliminated that. The point being we used to have a system that wasn't as rigged in how the tax structure functioned. The president and I have been trying to get rid of some of these loopholes for some time. Look, we have to change the corporate culture. Wealthy people are just as patriotic as poor people, I honest to God believe that. And, they understand we're one America, and we do best when we're all together. But, here's the deal, since when is the only job creator the person who invests in the company? My Dad sold automobiles as a general manager of a General Motors automobile dealership. He was a job creator. Everyone of those cars he sold he created a job for somebody on the assembly line. But today -- I have in my office, I have a cartoon from the New Yorker, great big rotund guy, a burglar with a mask on, and black beret, and black turtleneck, big bag of money on him just marked money. He's saying to the cop, he's saying, ""How was I supposed to know he was a job creator?"" MADDOW: (LAUGHING) BIDEN: Since when to corporations not have responsibility to the community? Since when do corporations not have responsibility to the community? Since when to the not have responsibility to their employees? You've got some leading guys in the country, who are like Fink (ph) and others who are making this case, Blackstone (ph). But it's about time. We don't have to reinvent the wheel, just go back to what it was in terms of how corporations acted in terms of their collective responsibility just 20 years ago. MADDOW: When I hear you talk about that work that remains to be done, building on what you've done, getting credit for what you've done in making sure that it gets advanced, I hear a desire for you to continue to do the work that you are doing. You have said on the record that although it was the right decision for you to not run for president this year, you also regret that decision every day. Why do you regret it? BIDEN: Well, the truth is I don't regret it. It was the right decision for my family, and the right decision for me. But, what I did say in the Rose Garden was I don't plan on remaining silent. And, I plan on doing this year, as I'm doing with you right now, making the case for not only the administration, but making the case why what we've done has laid the groundwork for a renaissance in America. You know, you turn on the television, it's like, ""Woah is me! God almighty, we're awful."" We are so down and out we are -- name me a country in the world, name me one leader anywhere in the world who wouldn't trade places in a heartbeat. We by far, we're going to own the 21st century. We have the greatest resource universities in the world, the only place in the world. We have the most productive workforce in the world. We have the most agile venture capitalists in the world. We have a situation where right now in the United States of America, we are near energy independent. North America is beginning to be the epicenter of energy. What is it that makes people think that this is not going to be the American century? I don't get it. I really don't.  I really, really, really don't.  And I know the polling data shows people have a negative view but if you listen to everything out there, you think, my God.  We're in such deep trouble.  We created more jobs than every other industrial country in the world combined.  Combined.  I travel a lot on foreign policy, as you know.  I'm in Europe a lot.  I travelled over a million miles as vice president.  They didn't do stimulus.  Look where they are.  Come on.  I mean, this is like, I just get so frustrated.  Like come on. MADDOW: Well in some frustration, what you want to do with it.  When you said that, in the rose garden, you weren't going to run.  You said you weren't going to stay silent and you said you were going to keep speaking out on the direction of the country and the direction of the party.  That part about the party, what do you want the Democratic Party to be doing differently -- BIDEN: To start to look more focused on the good that's been done and can be done.  I always kid the president in different circumstances.  Mr. President, a country's never going to be more optimistic than the president.  What is there to be pessimistic -- we have serious problems.  But compared to the problems we've had in the past in our -- I mean this isn't even close, where we are.  Sure, we have an obstacle, ISIS.  They can do great damage.  They can do great damage and they scare the living hell out of everybody with good reason.  But they are, instead of dealing with nation-states that are arranged against us, we're to deal with non-state actors that can do damage to us.  But this is within our control.  We are beginning to make genuine progress as to how we isolate them, how we take them out.  We're in a situation -- I mean, I just could go on.  But I am -- the only generic criticism I had is we're not talking about the possibilities. I was with Dung Chow Ping -- I mean, excuse me, I'm really dating myself.  I was the first guy to meet with him with six other senators a hundred years ago.  But I was with President Xi and I traveled with him a lot because his predecessor and President Obama thought we should get to know each other, and I had, I'm told by the State Department, 24, 25 hours of private dinners with him.  And we were in Chengdu, a town of 19 million, 20 million people.  There was only 2 million like a decade ago.  And he looked at me and just me and he and I and two interpreters, and he said, can you define America for me?  And I said, yes, I can define America for you.  One word.  Possibilities. That's who we are.  That's why I am so enthusiastic about this (ph) cancer effort.  One of the reasons to pick the cancer effort is to demonstrate to people that there's not much beyond our capacity.  It will take time, but if we focus, if we narrow down where the bottle necks are and we move, there's never been a problem we can't solve. MADDOW: It's this work that you've started on cancer, I know you've met with hundreds of researchers and philanthropies involved in cancer research -- we've declared war on cancer in the country in the past.  Nixon did it.  George W. Bush campaigned in 2000 on it, make an effort against cancer.  What have you learned about how it needs to be fixed and is this the work of the rest of your life? BIDEN: Yes, and I'll tell you, and yes.  With regard to what I've learned -- there's been, we are at an inflection point.  Almost every researcher and expert in cancer will tell you.  It hasn't been but the last five years that you had the immunology guys talking with the genetic guys talking with the virology guys -- they're all sort of separate silos.  And they're making some real progress now.  Secondly, what we have now, it's going to sound strange, we have enormous computing capability.  We're approaching being able to do a billion billion calculations per second, and that's the -- that's the objective of our national labs.  We're still not there.  But with (ph) hundreds of millions of calculations per second. Say, ""what's that have to do with anything, Joe?""  Well, every single solitary cancer you can't see, and it's like that -- it's like all those dots in that -- in that -- that light. MADDOW: Yeah. BIDEN: There's about 100 different cancers in a cancer cell.  And so what we're finding out is, they're finding out ways to deal with one or two of the cancers there, with certain medicines. But they don't know why, if you have that cancer and I have that cancer, and I get the therapy and you get it, I don't live and you live.  That -- they don't know why. So it's about aggregating data.  If we were able to put every single solitary cancer cell that has a genomic -- had their genome done in one place, we have the computing capacity to go in and look at what are the similarities and dissimilarities that make them work and don't work. And every expert will tell you, it is probably gonna exponentially increase the capacity to be able to find, A, cures, B, vaccines, and C, turn some cancers into chronic diseases, rather than it cost you your life. MADDOW: And is that -- that's the... BIDEN: But it's hard. MADDOW: ... trajectory of -- of the -- of the research and -- therapy research right now, is the -- has been can the government do something to accelerate that? BIDEN: Yes.  Here's what they can do.  They can do two things.  We can say, ""if you want government money, you have to make this data public -- you have to share it."" Number two, and I'm gonna say something outrageous, but I've met with all these people you've mentioned, the heads of all the major institutions, and they'll pull me aside private and say, ""hope you stay and then seek out (ph) forces for this.  Can't do this (ph) -- you got forces (ph) to do this."" MADDOW: So they need a convener.  We need something outside our world... BIDEN: A convener, absolutely, to get them to the point where the -- we don't want to take away any profit motive here.  But, for example, insurance companies.  They're just beginning to change -- excuse me.  Drug companies. There are -- I can give you examples, if we had more time, where one drug company has a -- has -- has developed, through their immunotherapy research, a particular drug for a particular cancer.  Another one, a different drug for a slightly different cancer. Researchers say, ""it'd be really great if we combined the two of them, put them together, because they -- they'll have an exponentially more positive impact than just using one.""  The drug companies say, ""no, no.  This is my proprietary interest."" They're beginning to change, and part of it is making sure that every single person who -- or family member who has -- who is a cancer patient, and/or, God forbid, dies of cancer, that they own their cancer genome and all their information, and they can decide where it goes.  They can decide the proper privacy guarantees around it, that it should be put in one repository. But now, you have these great institutions, each building these pipelines to figure out how they can amass more of the data that's -- not just cancers.  It's protein data, a whole range of things. And my -- my -- my objective is to bring them together and say, ""guys, there's got to be a better way where we can aggregate this more rapidly,"" now that we have the computing capacity to go in and do the things that you say can be done in order to get answers that are not obvious on their face, and exceed the capacity of the human brain to figure out right now, including artificial intelligence. But ironically, Big Data's gonna play a gigantic role in -- in... MADDOW: As an accelerator, and as an (inaudible). BIDEN: A significant accelerator. MADDOW: You -- it -- it seems clear that part of the reason that you have taken this on, and asked President Obama, basically, to put you in charge of this new effort, which he did overtly at State of the Union, got a huge response from the room in there when he said it. Obviously, part of the -- the inspiration for you in this is the death of your son, Beau.  We know that at the time that he passed he had been mulling a run for governor in Delaware.  I had been lucky enough to spend some time with him.  I was immensely impressed by him as a public servant.  I didn't know him as a friend.  I knew him as an attorney general.  A lot of people say that they could imagine him having gone on to run for president.  Does that -- is that something that you wished for him?  Do you daydream about that for him? BIDEN: Yes. MADDOW: Yes. BIDEN: Yes, I think it's a lost opportunity for the country.  I mean, this is an exceptional guy.  He's my son, and people expect me to say that, but I think if you -- almost anybody you talk to you -- I mean this is a truly exceptional guy.  This is a guy who never complained, never explained.  This is a guy who -- everything about him was duty.  I mean, this is a guy who didn't have to go to Iraq, but he insisted on going.  This is a guy who was highly-decorated and came back.  This is a guy who had a chance to be appointed to the Attorney General's office.  He wouldn't take it.  He had a chance to be appointed to my Senate seat.  He wanted no part of it.  He wouldn't do it all himself.  And so, he had his own brand. But, you know, one of the reasons why I got so engaged in this wasn't just the loss of my son.  When you have someone you adore in trouble, you try to learn as much as you can as quickly as you can in the hope that you can (inaudible) somehow what they're facing.  And so, Beau's illness, that lasted well over a year, forced me -- not forced me -- enabled me to get deep in the weeds about cancer and cancer research. And so, it wasn't just that he was ill, he died, and I decided that I had to help, or try to help.  It was that I learned so much from so many of these brilliant, brilliant docs, that I began to realize they were right, and we are at an inflection point and we need something to push it over.  And it's -- and, by the way, you know, I almost wish we didn't say Moon Shot because what we're really talking about here is to be able to do in the next five years that would take 10 to 15 years to do.  It's within our capacity to do that. MADDOW: You want to be an accelerator. BIDEN: Absolutely, positively, because it will save lives worldwide. MADDOW: Let me ask you about the Supreme Court. BIDEN: Yes. MADDOW: I know that you're going to be going to Justice Scalia's funeral on Saturday. BIDEN: I am. MADDOW: He was confirmed unanimously by the Senate in 1986.  You voted for him. BIDEN: Yes. MADDOW: You said years later that you regretted that vote.  You said he was a fine, honorable, and decent man, but you wish you had not voted for him.  Why did you end up -- BIDEN: Well, I went on to say because he's so effective because his view, his constraint -- I call constraint, he calls it strict, instructed (ph) view of how to read the constitution -- was different than mine.  I think it's a living document.  He thinks it's a dead document in the sense that's exactly was it says, basically, is what it meant at the time.  And so, we end up with very different positions. I became friends with him.  I loved his wife, Maureen and his son, Carl (ph).  I mean, it's a -- we've got -- Jill and I have gotten to know them.  I have great respect for him.  And like the president said, he was probably one of the most significant justices in the history of the United States of America in terms of an impact on the court. It's kind of like, you know, I wished I'd picked so and so on my team because, good, look at all the home runs he hit.  You know what I mean?  That's what I regret is he was so successful in taking the court a direction different than I thought it should be taken. MADDOW: In the Senate, you ran confirmation hearings for, I think, five different Supreme Court nominees? BIDEN: I think eight -- I don't know, but they... MADDOW: At least five. BIDEN: ... they -- they -- they tell me other than Jim Eastland, I presided over more Supreme Court nominees than anybody in history. MADDOW: You didn't vote for all the nominees at these hearings... BIDEN: I didn't. MADDOW: ... you oversaw, but you convened those hearings.  They all went to the floor for a vote.  Why do you think Republicans are now saying that President Obama shouldn't even nominate someone to fill Justice Scalia's seat? BIDEN: (inaudible) my words here.  I think because they're intimidated by -- by the dominant element of the Republican Party, the national politics right now, the far right.  I think they're intimidated by it.  I think it's the tail wagging the dog. And I think the leadership went out to make sure they got out ahead of Ted Cruz.  I don't believe in their heart they think this makes sense.  We've never done this before.  It's -- keep in mind, Rachel, if we don't start -- if we don't nominate someone in the next month or so, start the hearing process.  And they say nothing's going to happen until the next election.  It won't be until next June or July before you have a Supreme Court justice. We have a dysfunctional Congress now.  We don't need an institutionally dysfunctional Supreme Court. MADDOW: If we have a vacancy on the Supreme Court for a year, for 18 months, is that a constitutional crisis?  Or is that a political problem of a different order? BIDEN: Well, I think it is a political problem of a different order because you're not going to get resolution, potentially, on serious issues that require resolution.  For example, you know, it's interesting how -- how back when Warren was deciding Brown vs. the Board, he had the votes, but he wouldn't actually bring -- bring the decision up until he had one southerner who would support it, because he knew that if it was -- if every southerner on the bench was against it, it would be viewed as a north-south, and it would legitimize people in the south saying ""we're not going to participate in this."" There -- there is a -- the court is not just made up of individuals.  It's a body.  It's an organic organization.  And -- and to have it as, you know -- that's why it's an uneven number.  That's why there's nine.  And there are so many important decisions that have to be resolved that affect us internationally and nationally that I don't think it's responsible at all. And by the way, you know, this idea of -- I remember George Mitchell -- I was doing the Clarence Thomas hearing, and there were 48 senators declared they were not prepared to vote for him at the front end.  We could have filibustered that and stopped it.  George and I -- George was the leader at the time -- took the heat from every liberal group saying, ""No, no, that's not the way the system is supposed to work, since the Constitution -- the president shall propose and the Constitution shall dispose, we're going to let them hear this."" MADDOW: Even though you knew -- you thought it would be no -- or it seemed clear that it might be no, you wanted to let the process go forward... (CROSSTALK) BIDEN: Yes, because -- because that's what the Constitution called for.  And by the way, Bork only got -- excuse me -- Thomas only got 48 votes.  And you know, that's -- that's filibuster-proof.  You need 60 votes to break it.  So we could have easily -- not easily -- could have stopped him from, you know, being on the court.  But it would -- it was a -- it was a prostitution of the Constitution.  That's not how it's supposed to work. And the system matters.  It matters a lot.  Procedure matters. MADDOW: Do you have faith that this is going to happen the way that you're describing it should?  Do you think that there is going to be a... (CROSSTALK) BIDEN: I have -- I have faith that the president -- and he's asked me to advise him, as I have on the last two -- is going to appoint someone who is qualified -- by qualified, meaning that they have the intellectual capacity.  They have the judicial temperament.  They have no crimes of moral turpitude.  They are someone who will actually have an open mind and listen on the court. I think we ought to be able to find a consensus candidate that meets that criteria.  Because the Senate does have a right to have a say in who -- and what the philosophy of the nominee is.  But they only get to dispose.  The president proposes. I'll tell you a quick story.  When Bork was defeated, then Ginsberg pulled out, I was chairman.  And Ronald Reagan called me down to the Oval Office.  And Howard Baker was then his chief of staff.  So the three of us sat in the Oval.  And he sat down.  He was gregarious.  And he said, ""OK, Joe, who do you want?""  And I said, ""Mr. President,"" I said, ""Yours is to propose, mine to dispose.""  I said, ""You tell me who you have in mind, I'll give you an honest answer what their chances are in my view."" I said -- I said, ""You know, Senator Borah, a famous chairman from the state of Idaho, went down to see I think it was Coolidge, although it could have been Harding.  I'm not sure.""  And Harding said, ""Well, I have a list of 10 names.""  And he pulled out -- oops, I just took this off -- he pulled out the card.  And in doing so, he had 10 names on the list. And Borah looked at the list and said, ""Mr. President, great list, except it's upside down (inaudible)."" (LAUGHTER) (inaudible).  So he then read off to me the potential nominees he had in mind.  And with Howard there, I told him, ""Mr. President, I think that that person will have -- suffer the same fate as Bork; this person I think would probably get nominated; that person would...""  And you know, that's part of the advise and consent process. MADDOW: So should President Obama do that with Senator Grassley? BIDEN: Yes. MADDOW: Do you think he will? BIDEN: Yes, I'm confident he'll -- he'll reach out to the Senate and go through the process of advise and consent. MADDOW: I'm going to throw you a little bit of a curve ball, which is that just this afternoon, a Senate source has told MSNBC that it is beyond just idle chatter that there's been some significant discussion that you might conceivably be the president's choice, (inaudible) under these unusual political circumstances.  Talk about one person who could get through and maybe nobody else could. If the president asked you to do it, would you say yes? BIDEN: You never say to a president for certain you wouldn't do anything, but I have no -- look at me now -- I have no desire to sit on the Supreme Court, none.  It would be a great honor (inaudible), but I have no desire, any more than George Mitchell did. MADDOW: Who do you think the president should pick? BIDEN: Well, I'm not -- I haven't even had a chance to sit down with him yet to talk about the potential candidates.  When we do, as in the past, lay out all the people, go out and survey a little bit, and see who we think -- who meets those criteria and we think could have a chance of being confirmed. MADDOW: There is nobody alive who has more experience with the confirmation of Supreme Court nominees than you do, from your time in the Senate.  Literally, there's nobody else. BIDEN: Well, that's true, but I'm not sure what that qualifies me for. MADDOW: Well, I wonder, though, when it comes -- when it comes time and there is a nominee, presuming it's not you, I mean, will you be... (CROSSTALK) BIDEN: Oh, I'll -- no, no.  I will be deeply involved.  I mean, it's -- one of my roles as vice president is to -- is to be an interlocutor with the Senate and the House because everybody up there knows I respect them and I enjoy it.  And I have a lot of good friends on both sides of the aisle up there. So, whether that's enough to persuade them who we pick is a different issue. MADDOW: We've had a conservative majority court since basically the early '70s. BIDEN: Yes. MADDOW: If that changes and the conservatives are no longer in the majority for the first time in a generation, do you think that -- are conservative right to worry that that would mean a radical change in the country?   That... (CROSSTALK) BIDEN: Sure.  They are -- look, if you go back and look at the history of Supreme Court fights from the very beginning -- I won't bore you with the history, I mean, I've read (ph) so much about it. There is a corresponding interest, and and the intent of the interest of the Senate with, as it relates to the probability that the next appointee would alter the balance in the court. So, it is, and this is, you could not pick a more -- and we've know this was coming for a long time. We didn't think it'd be Scalia, but both on the side of the so called -- and, by the way, the liberal in the court today want aren't Brennan, you know? It's not like we just kind... (LAUGHING) MADDOW: ... They don't make liberals like they used to? BIDEN: It's going to be enormous interest. And, what I've found before, Rachel, is that I was raised in a scholastic tradition in education that the ends never justify the means. You'll find interest groups that are very principled, left and right now. If they think the courts going to change in one direction or another, they'll forget all about this in the means, they just want the ends. What's the end? I'll do anything to stop this person. I'll do anything to get this person. So, it gets very, very -- this is a place where there are very few interest groups on the outside that are totally, totally principled about sticking to exactly what they preached. And, so it makes it more complicated. MADDOW: Let me ask you one for of news of the day question, and it is also about the 2016 race. Pope Francis did his cross-border map yesterday... BIDEN: (INAUDIBLE) MADDOW: ...  He is a world wide figure in a way that not all Popes have been. On his way home from his six day trip to Mexico on his plane he made remarks to reporters today, and he was specifically asked about Donald Trump. He said anybody who was building walls instead of building bridges is not a Christian. And, Trump has reacted to this. Called it disgraceful, the Pope's remarks, and said that nobody should question his faith. I have to ask you as a Catholic, and as an observer of 2016, what you think about that? BIDEN: Pope Francis, Trump, it's not a hard call for me. It's not even close. (LAUGHING) MADDOW: Is it fair to say if somebody wants to build a wall, by definition, isn't a Christian? BIDEN: Well, I am not a theologian, nor am I a priest or a minister, but I think building walls is fundamentally contrary to what made this country what it is. We're a pluralistic society in its functions. Look around the world. Every other country where there's absolute chaos now, what is it? They're pluralistic without consensus. Look at almost every single country, from Syria, to Iraq, to Iran, Ukraine, no matter where it is. I just think it is totally counter to our tradition. Should we have border security there? Yes. But the idea of the United States erecting a wall for the world to see makes a lie of everything we say about ourselves. It's a little bit like why the President and I feel so strongly about closing Guantanamo. It is inconsistent with who we are. We have a Bill of Rights, we have trial by jury. We have a notion that you are -- you're innocent until you're proven guilty. We have all these things. Look, I've been saying for the last nine years, our power comes as much from -- our respect in the world comes as much from the exercise of our power as it does from the power of our principles.  Why do people like America?  They say, well, you have the largest military in the world.  Because you have more people, et cetera.  They like America for what we stand for.  And one of the things, and I feel proud to be, what this president's for, the last seven years, is we have once again aligned our basic fundamental beliefs and principles with our conduct.  And it matters.  It matters in terms of our security.  It matters in terms of our ability to influence the world.  It matters in our ability to succeed. MADDOW: Briefly, just as a follow up to that, President Obama was asked this week if he could imagine Mr. Trump becoming the nominee of the Republican party.  The president reiterated that Mr. Trump will never be president.  Very deftly getting around the question of whether or not the Republican Party's going to nominate him.  Let us put that to you as well.  Do you think that he will be the nominee?  Do you think that could happen? BIDEN: I think it is very possible he could be nominated and depending on how this all plays out, I would take him seriously in terms of being able to win because he's appealing to a very, very -- he's appealing to fear.  He's appealing to, that whole expression, everybody who asked me, why is Trump able to win in those 16 people?  There's a whole expression.  In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.  I'm not very good at prognosticating but I would not be surprised if he's the nominee.  I would be surprised if he got elected. MADDOW: Mr. Vice President, having this much time with you is a real honor. BIDEN: Oh, it's been an honor.  Are you kidding?  Thanks.  Thank you. END"
msnbc|"Vice President Joe Biden wants to be taken more seriously. He doesn""t appreciate his popular image as goof-ball ""Uncle Joe"" who is always putting his foot in his mouth. ""The vice president thing... Isn""t that a bitch?"" he said last week to a Harvard senior who introduced himself as the student government vice president. But Biden's other comments late last week didn't do him any favors, either. He spoke out about Arab countries allegedly funding the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, including that Turkey had allowed jihadists across its border into Syria -- comments for which he was forced to apologize immediately. ""President Erdogan told me, ""You were right. We let too many people through. So we""re trying to seal the border,"""" Biden said after his meeting with Turkey's president during the U.N. General Assembly. Erdogan parried that Turkey had not given ""even the smallest amount of support"" to terrorists, adding ""I never admitted any mistake, nor did we tell them they 'were right' during my visit to the U.S."" He insisted Biden apologize or ""he will be history for me,"" according to the Associated Press . It may be Biden""s biggest blunder yet, both for its scale -- he incited a bona fide international incident -- and because it""s on a topic, foreign policy, where Biden draws the most strength. It""s one thing for Biden to use an antiquated word or get out ahead of the president on marriage equality. Those gaffes are funny at best and politically inconvenient a worst. But it's entirely different for the sitting vice president of the United States to alienate key allies in a fragile coalition helping to fight America's latest war. If he runs for president against Hillary Clinton in 2016, it will be on the strength of his foreign policy chops, which would him to present a credible alternative to Clinton""s more hawkish worldview. But moments like this undermine that credibility. Despite all the caricatures of Biden -- including The Onion 's famous depiction of the vice president washing a Pontiac Trans Am in the White House driveway -- he is an exceptional politician. Biden didn""t become one of the youngest senators in U.S. history, and then chairman of two key committees, and later vice president of the United States, by accident. So it""s little wonder that Biden often complains  to profile writers about his image in the media, and reporters' eagerness to seize on his every faux pas. But even Biden""s biggest defenders have to acknowledge that he seems to have a constitutional inability to help himself. While he wishes people paid more attention to his substance than his slips of the tongue, time and again he undermines that substance through no fault but his own. For years, Biden was one of the best allies of domestic abuse victims in the Senate, using his perch atop the Judiciary Committee to pass landmark legislation. When the NFL needed someone to help them clean up their act, they turned to a former Biden aide. And President Obama put him in charge of these issues in the White House. But last month, when Biden spoke to a Democratic women""s group around the anniversary of the signing of the Violence Against Women Act (his proudest accomplishment as a senator), the vice president managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory . With one passing reference a disgraced senator who was forced to resign for allegedly sexually harassing a dozen women, Biden managed to undercut the other 33 minutes of a blockbuster speech on gender equality. Two days earlier in Iowa, a state critical to any presidential wannabe, Biden pulled the rug out from underneath himself again. A tangential reference to an official he deemed "" the wisest man in the Orient "" overshadowed an otherwise fiery populist speech. The day before that, it was a Shakespearean term with anti-semitic baggage that forced him to apologize . The list goes on. Biden may be right that he should be taken more seriously, but he""s not doing himself any favors. And the problem with his latest gaffe is that it is serious."
msnbc|"Vice President Joe Biden , sporting his famed aviator sunglasses, addressed Yale University's class of 2015 Sunday in New Haven, Connecticut. Below are eight words of wisdom Biden imparted to the graduating class and their families. 1. Be compassionate. ""It""s not that all that difficult, folks, to be compassionate when you""ve been the beneficiary of compassion in your lowest moments not only from your family, but from your friends and total strangers. Because when you know how much it meant to you, you know how much it mattered. It""s not hard to be compassionate."" 2. Find the sweet spot between success and happiness. ""I""ve been lucky. And my wish for all of you is that not only tomorrow, but 20 and 40 and 50 years from now, you""ve found that sweet spot, that thing that allows you to get up in the morning, put both feet on the floor, go out and pursue what you love, and think it still matters. But all of you have one thing in common you will all seek to find that sweet spot that satisfies your ambition and success and happiness."" RELATED: President Obama is now on Twitter 3. Don't question anyone's motives. ""I said, that guy, Jesse Helms, he has no social redeeming value.  He doesn't care — I really mean it — I was angry. He doesn't care about people in need. He has a disregard for the disabled. Majority Leader Mansfield then proceeded to tell me that three years earlier, Jesse and Dot Helms, sitting in their living room in early December before Christmas, reading an ad in the Raleigh Observer, the picture of a young man, 14-years-old with braces on his legs up to both hips, saying, all I want is someone to love me and adopt me. He looked at me and he said, and they adopted him, Joe. ""I felt like a fool. He then went on to say, Joe, it""s always appropriate to question another man""s judgment, but never appropriate to question his motives because you simply don't know his motives ...   From that moment on, I tried to look past the caricatures of my colleagues and try to see the whole person. Never once have I questioned another man""s or woman""s motive."" 4. Make ""real"" relationships. ""Resist the temptation of your generation to let ""network"" become a verb that saps the personal away, that blinds you to the person right in front of you, blinds you to their hopes, their fears, and their burdens. Build real relationships — even with people with whom you vehemently disagree. You""ll not only be happier. You will be more successful."" 5. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. ""The second thing I""ve noticed is that although you know no one is better than you, every other persons is equal to you and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect ... Regardless of their academic or social backgrounds, those who had the most success and who were most respected and therefore able to get the most done were the ones who never confused academic credentials and societal sophistication with gravitas and judgment."" RELATED: 'Amtrak Joe' Biden reacts to deadly train disaster 6. Ambition without perspective can be a killer. ""Ambition is really important. You need it. And I certainly have never lacked in having ambition. But ambition without perspective can be a killer. I know a lot of you already understand this ... And some of your families made enormous sacrifices for this great privilege. And many of you faced your own crises, some unimaginable ... Find the balance between ambition and happiness, what will make you really feel fulfilled. "" 7. Trust your gut. ""Take this job, make that much money, live in this place, hang out with people like you, take no real risks and have no real impact, while getting paid for the false sense of both. But resist that temptation to rationalize what others view is the right choice for you — instead of what you feel in your gut is the right choice — that""s your North Star. Trust it.  Follow it."" 8. Engage the world around you. ""You can't breathe fresh air or protect your children from a changing climate no matter what you make. If your sister is the victim of domestic violence, you are violated. If your brother can""t marry the man he loves, you are lessened. And if your best friend has to worry about being racially profiled, you live in a circumstance not worthy of us. It matters. So be successful. I sincerely hope some of you become millionaires and billionaires. I mean that. But engage the world around you because you will be more successful and happier."""
msnbc|"WASHINGTON -- A senior adviser to Joe Biden's late son Beau is joining the Draft Biden Super PAC to lay the financial groundwork for a potential presidential bid -- a key hurdle for the sitting vice president if he hopes to take on Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary. Josh Alcorn, finance director and later senior adviser to Beau Biden, raised $1.2 million in six months in 2013 to fund Beau Biden's potential bid for governor of Delaware. Alcorn moved back to Delaware from Washington, D.C., to work on Beau Biden's bid after managing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's vast national network of donors as finance director. Alcorn traveled consistently with Beau and served as a political confidante. Related: Will Joe Biden challenge Hillary Clinton for Democratic nomination? Beau Biden's gubernatorial campaign was never launched because the vice president's son was diagnosed with brain cancer. He died in May. ""I'm thrilled that Josh is joining Draft Biden. Biden supporters across the country know how close he was to Beau and his family,"" Will Pierce, Executive Director of Draft Biden 2016, said in a statement Sunday. ""Josh joining the Draft Biden effort only increases the seriousness nature of what to date has been an enormously successful effort,"" Pierce added. While Alcorn's move isn't formally sanctioned by the Biden family, his new role lends legitimacy to a group that's built an email list of 170,000 potential Biden supporters. And amid news reports that a dying Beau urged his father to run for president, it's one of the first concrete and public steps from a member of the son's inner circle encouraging a challenge to Hillary Clinton. Alcorn's goal is to use his perch at Draft Biden -- a small movement that's persisted mostly online and hasn't raised significant money or held large events -- to gauge interest from major donors in Joe Biden and Beau Biden's inner circles in supporting a bid. The super PAC can raise unlimited funds, and could allow top donors to send a message supporting Biden's potential run. ""With Josh's help, we'll be able to expand our fundraising to show the VP the country is ready for him to enter the race,"" Pierce said. Biden insiders say the former vice president is talking to aides and advisers as he weighs a bid. But many of Joe Biden's closest political advisers have already signed on with Clinton's campaign, including former national security adviser Jake Sullivan. Still, insiders say that since Biden's son died in May, many of the family's longtime financial supporters have been asking where to send checks to encourage a Joe Biden bid."
msnbc|Vice President Joe Biden is nearing a decision on if he will enter the presidential race, which could come within 48 hours, two sources tells NBC News. Biden has been contemplating a presidential run for months and has delayed an announcement beyond supposed timeframes multiple times before. Missing this deadline, of course, could happen again. In addition to when, the big unknown is what Biden's decision will be: Is he in our is he out? Biden's public schedule gives little indication of his decision. He traveled from his home in Delaware to Washington Monday morning where he will address a climate change summit this afternoon. If Biden does announce within the next two days, his decision would come before current front runner, Hillary Clinton, appears before the House committee charged with investigating the Benghazi attacks more than three years ago. In a signal that he is considering running, Biden spoke with International Association of Fire Fighters President Harold Schaitberger for about 20 minutes on Friday. Biden said he was strongly considering running and was trying to gauge the support of unions, a source said. This story originally appeared on NBCNews.com
msnbc|"In a normal democratic election, candidates who win the most votes prevail. In American presidential elections, it's vastly more complicated, and candidates who receive fewer votes can -- and occasionally do - take office. It's against this backdrop that Joe Biden isn't just focused on winning the U.S. popular vote, which is likely, but also winning the popular vote by a large enough margin to actually prevail over Donald Trump. And what kind of margin will the former vice president need? FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver crunched the numbers and determined Biden's chances of winning the electoral college vote based on the size of his popular-vote victory. Nate added that a 2020 victory isn't really ""safe"" for Biden unless he wins the popular vote by 5 or more percentage points. (The Economist's G. Elliott Morris published a related set of numbers, which were slightly more favorable to the Democratic ticket, but overall pointed in a similar direction.) In other words, if Biden narrowly receives more votes than Trump, there's a 94% chance the Republican will win the election. If Biden defeats Trump by 2 or 3 percentage points, the former vice president would still likely lose, despite the will of the American electorate. The Washington Post 's Paul Waldman added yesterday, ""Turnout projections are running at around 150 million this year (137 million voted in 2016), which would mean that if Silver is right, Biden could win by 3 million to 4.5 million votes and still have less than a 50 percent chance of becoming president . If Biden won by 4 percent to 5 percent, or 6 million to 7.5 million votes, Trump would still have a one-in-ten shot of prevailing."" I bring this up for a couple of reasons. First, it helps provide a lens through which to see polling: the closer the 2020 surveys, the more likely it is Trump will win the election, even if he receives fewer votes. Second, it's worth occasionally pausing to emphasize just how indefensible the current system is. Many Americans probably think electoral-college/popular-vote splits are incredibly rare and not worth worrying about. After all, most of the time, the candidate backed by the most voters actually becomes president. But if Trump wins in 2020 after losing the popular vote, it will be the sixth time in 58 presidential elections in U.S. history. That""s a failure rate of nearly 10%, which isn""t that rare. More to the point, however, if Trump wins after losing the popular vote again, it will mean three of the six failures will have occurred since 2000. Or put another way, there will have been six elections in the 21st century, and the candidate who failed to garner the most public support will have taken office in half of those elections . I remember one prominent political figure declaring not too long ago, ""The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy,"" which is hardly an unreasonable point. That prominent political figure was Donald Trump ."
msnbc|"DETROIT -- Joe Biden""s appearance Thursday at Netroots Nation, an annual gathering of progressive activists, was supposed to be a chance for the vice president to burnish his credentials on a number of progressive issues. But his speech was overshadowed by the downing of a Malaysian passenger jet over Ukraine earlier in the day and anti-deportation protesters. Biden, 71, has a reputation for being plainspoken, sometimes to a fault. But in addressing the much younger, tech-savvy crowd, he appeared to be in full salesman mode. Though Biden is thought to be eyeing the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, he""s got a long way to go in overtaking front-runner Hillary Clinton. A new NBC News/Marist poll released Thursday has the former secretary of state beating Biden by at least fifty points in the crucial early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Clinton may be slightly less popular among members of the party""s left wing, but Elizabeth Warren, who is scheduled to address the Netroots gathering Friday morning, has overwhelmingly been the progressive anti-Clinton of choice. The ""Ready for Warren"" campaign had its official launch at Netroots, but the Massachusetts senator has not endorsed the group""s activities. Biden was an hour late to take the stage, at least in part because he was being briefed on the Malaysian Airlines crash which had taken place earlier that day. Biden told the crowd the plane had "" apparently "" been shot down, but that much was still unknown regarding the circumstances of the incident. ""There may have been American citizens on board, and obviously that's our first concern,"" he said. ""And now we're working every minute to try and confirm those reports as we speak."" Biden was soon interrupted by protesters who rose from the audience and began to chant, ""Stop deporting our families,"" presumably in response to the mass deportations currently ramping up along America's southern border. Biden replied, ""I respect your view and share your view"" – suggesting he did not agree with President Barack Obama""s insistence that the children from Central America currently pouring over the border will be sent back. Biden also exhorted the audience to applaud the protesters. While Biden""s reaction to the protesters"" outburst may have won the audience back to his side temporarily, it is unlikely to diffuse long-term anger over the Obama administration's deportation record. Biden tried to keep his speech in safer territory, recalling the famous moment in 2012 when he came out publicly in favor of marriage equality before Obama had officially announced his own change of heart on the matter. ProgressNow executive director Arshad Hasan, who introduced the vice president to the crowd, credited him with ""changing the dialogue in the White House."" ""When I get asked a direct question, I give a direct answer,"" Biden said of his comments on same sex marriage. ""I come out of the civil rights movement. And there's not a way in God's green earth that I could sit there and be asked a question about the civil rights movement of our day and remain silent."" Biden said Obama had agreed with the vice president""s remarks and had greeted him with a ""big hug"" the next time they met. Biden cycled through a number of other issues near and dear to Netroots attendees' hearts. Climate change, Biden said, is real. The federal government, he said, needs to enact an employment nondiscrimination law, restore the middle class, and close tax loopholes for the wealthy. Responding to recent remarks from his predecessor, former vice president Dick Cheney, Biden argued that ""it's just as important to feed our people as it is to fund our military."" The speech closed with a portion that seemed aimed at a broader audience, beyond the Netroots convention. Urging the crowd to be civil when dealing with conservatives, he insisted Americans ""are not inherently divided."" ""We can debate without being demeaning,"" he said. ""We should not hesitate for a minute to question the flawed judgment of our opponents, without having any necessity to question their motives."" The last line of his speech: ""Never bet against America. It has never been a good bet."""
msnbc|"It's March — again — and a certain restlessness is stirring among President Joe Biden's allies. After a long winter, which followed four years that felt like an eternity , folks are getting antsy. If you want proof, look no further than the news reported Thursday by Politico that the White House is weighing negotiations with Republicans to raise the federal minimum wage. Progressives already saw it as a ""gut punch"" that the wage hike was stripped out of the Senate version of the next Covid-19 stimulus bill without much of a fight. That decision has supporters wondering how on Earth the $15-an-hour rate that Biden campaigned on will come to pass. You can chalk the broader impatience up to a few different things — advocates who want their particular issues directly in the White House's field of vision, the heavy lift required to reset things after the Trump administration, voters who want promises to be kept, the constraints of linear time and the 24-hour day. But on topics from immigration reform to the use of the military to revamping the Federal Communications Commission to delivering on the promised stimulus checks, there's a concern that Biden's team is dragging its feet on delivering the changes it guaranteed before it won the election. In contrast to this feeling is the refrain from some Democrats that now isn't the right time to criticize Biden and his policies. The No. 1 reason people have cited this belief to me is that he's been in office for less than two months — we have to give him time! Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither is an agenda! Why handicap the president or bet against him with all of this discord in the ranks? New York magazine's Ed Kilgore took a similar stance in an article published Thursday, in which he marveled that, even though he is on the verge of getting a $1.9 trillion stimulus measure passed and most of his nominees confirmed, Biden is ""currently being beset by criticism from multiple directions."" In his view, ""the wins far outweigh the losses and omissions. Give the 46th president a break."" I can see where this instinct comes from, as Kilgore makes a lot of salient points about the headwinds against Biden and his progress so far. But I still have to disagree. Now is exactly the right time to criticize Biden. In fact, this is when it's most critical to be critical. Biden enjoys 52.7 percent approval now, according to FiveThirtyEight's aggregate of various polls . That's below where his two Democratic predecessors were 45 days into office and about 10 points above where former President Donald Trump was at this time. Popularity in the polls is often used as a stand-in for "" political capital "" — the idea that politicians have a pool of goodwill that can be depleted or replenished. And early in a president's term is when that pool tends to be at its highest and ready to be spent, like a credit card with zero dollars on its balance. Biden already faces questions about how he wants to spend that capital, especially once the stimulus bill passes. Immigration reform advocates, for example, are ""frustrated"" that Trump-era policies to detain and deport families who arrive at the southern border because of Covid-19 concerns are still in place. Meanwhile, some Democrats are upset that Neera Tanden's nomination to head the Office of Management and Budget tanked — but for differing reasons. In one corner, you have the people who think that the opposition to her was sexist and tinged with anti-Asian racism and that Biden should have fought harder for her; in the other, those who wonder why the administration spent capital on defending her nomination at all given her combativeness toward Republicans and other Democrats alike. Beyond the immediate challenges, and there are many, now is when priorities are being set for the rest of the term. Campaigns are malleable; their focuses can shift more easily, lacking as they are in the power to enact their proposals. In contrast, governing is chiseled into stone — there's no getting back time spent on issues that are of lesser importance in the eyes of the White House. The Obama administration decided early on that health care reform would be its main focus after the 2009 stimulus bill passed. In the months after, it was clear where the White House's priorities were, leaving open the question of what could be bargained away or shelved to achieve that ultimate goal. Now is the time for outsiders in Congress, the media and the broader public to help shape those priorities. But maybe you think the united GOP opposition to Biden's biggest goals is the best reason to avoid criticizing him. Yes, it's true that Republicans are adept at exploiting weaknesses and division among Democrats. Wedge issues work for a reason. But that obstructionism also shows why it's important to hold Biden's team to account. It's entirely possible to call out Republicans and to make sure the administration isn't wasting its time in pursuit of deals that don't exist. See: the decision to move forward with reconciliation on the stimulus bill, despite Biden's pledge of bipartisanship. And finally, there are some areas where it's just baffling that Biden hasn't used his authority to move further and faster. Things like not lifting Trump's sanctions against the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court , not taking stronger action against Saudi Arabia for killing Jamal Khashoggi and not engaging Iran on its nuclear program more quickly are missed opportunities, and we should be able to say so. Again, I understand the desire to protect Biden from criticism — but if you're looking to the media (including opinion columnists) to shield him, you're mistaken. New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd correctly pointed to a growing misunderstanding of the media's function , even on the left. ""They loathe Fox News but assume that the mainstream media are basically on their side, the same way Fox commentators are on Trump's,"" Dowd wrote Saturday. But that's just not the case. Nobody is calling on the perfect to be the enemy of the good here. Deals have to be made, and wielding power like a sledgehammer is messier than a lot of people think. Nor am I saying a lot of rhetorical trash isn't going to be thrown Biden's way in the near future to block him. But fair, good-faith criticism is a necessity for good governance. There has to be room in a healthy democracy to call out mistakes, or even just bad ideas, especially by the people who in theory are in your camp. So, sorry, Joe. It's nothing personal, but I'm going to keep calling 'em like I sees 'em."
cnn|"My request to interview Vice President Joe Biden had been outstanding for almost a year when, in the final days of the 2016 campaign, I was offered 15 minutes with him, one-to-one. The date was October 28, 11 days before Election Day. My choices were to travel either to Duluth, Minnesota, or to St. Louis. I decided to ""meet him in St. Louie."" The timing seemed perfect. Biden had just called out Donald Trump, old school: ""I wish we were in high school – I could take him behind the gym. That""s what I wish."" Trump responded in kind: ""I""d love that. I""d love that. Mr. Tough Guy."" I intended to revisit that spat. But the night before the interview, my focus shifted. Politico reported that Hillary Clinton""s transition team had put Biden""s name at the top of a list of potential secretaries of state. That seemed like perfect fodder. Unfortunately, Friday morning, a reporter in Duluth got Biden on the record saying he was not interested. Now I was scrambling for a focus, and the calling out of Trump seemed stale. Then came a divine intervention. The interview was scheduled for 5 p.m. backstage at the Pageant, a historic theater at which Biden was appearing at a rally for Missouri Senate candidate Jason Kander. Early that afternoon, FBI Director James Comey sent shockwaves through the election when he alerted Congress that agents were reviewing newfound emails from Clinton""s time as secretary of state. I crossed my fingers and hoped no one would ask Biden about Comey before me. The veep ran about 90 minutes late. I waited in a small dressing room. CNN producers covered the mirrors with black bed sheets from Walmart and installed an American flag, which would appear over the vice president""s right shoulder. Finally he arrived, and we chatted for 20 minutes. There was one key exchange: BIDEN: ""I think Hillary – if she said, what I""m told she said, is correct – release the emails. For the whole world to see. To the best of my knowledge, it won""t prejudice the investigation, but that""s the stilted language the agency always uses. And it doesn""t mean anything. It""s unfortunate."" SMERCONISH: ""I""d be remiss if I didn""t note that if she had released all the emails from the get-go, we wouldn""t be having this conversation."" BIDEN: ""Well, that""s true. But I don""t know where this email, where these emails came from – SMERCONISH: ""Apparently, Anthony Weiner."" BIDEN: ""Well, oh, God. Anthony Weiner. I should not comment on Anthony Weiner. I""m not a big fan. And I wasn""t before he got in trouble. So I shouldn""t comment on Anthony Weiner."" His face, at my mention of Weiner – the former congressman who has been embroiled in sexting scandals – said everything. It was classic, unguarded Biden."
cnn|"Joe and Jill Biden launched The Biden Foundation on Wednesday, telling supporters in a video that ""as long as he has a breath in it"" the former vice president will be working on issues that matter to him.

In the video posted to the foundation""s website, Biden says the endeavor will work specifically on violence against women by focusing on college campuses. ""We have got to change the culture,"" said Biden, who authored the Violence Against Women Act and eventually ushered it to passage in 1994. Biden also notes in the video that he will continue his ""cancer moonshot,"" an effort kicked off by the Obama administration and approved by Congress last year . The effort is a personal crusade for Biden, whose son Beau died after a long fight with brain cancer . ""We are at an inflection point in the fight against cancer that didn""t exists four or five years ago,"" Biden said. ""We can change people""s lives.""

cnn|"Hunter Biden""s decision to speak publicly about his seat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company – and his relationship with his father – makes clear that he, at least, is concerned that he could be a problem for his father""s 2020 presidential campaign. ""I did nothing wrong at all,"" Hunter Biden told ABC News in an interview that ran Tuesday morning. ""However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is – it""s a swamp, in many ways? Yeah. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.""  Later in the interview, Hunter added this: ""You know what? I""m a human. And you know what, did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based on some unethical lapse? Absolutely not."" Hunter Biden was careful to note that he didn""t tell his father (or the campaign) before deciding to speak publicly about his seat on the board of Burisma Holdings, which reportedly paid him as much as $50,000 a month. And Hunter reiterated what he has said before – that he and his father had only a single conversation about Burisma in which Joe Biden warned his son, ""I hope you know what you""re doing."" President Donald Trump has sought to use Hunter Biden""s connection to Burisma against Joe Biden – even soliciting help from the president of Ukraine on a phone call, leading to the current impeachment inquiry in the US House. But Trump""s repeated insistence that Joe Biden did something nefarious by trying to remove a prosecutor in Ukraine is simply not borne out by the facts. No matter how many times Trump screams corruption, it doesn""t change the fact that there is zero evidence that Joe Biden""s actions in Ukraine as vice president had anything to do with his son. None. OK, we all clear on that? OK! Good! But that doesn""t mean that Hunter Biden won""t be a problem for his father""s campaign. Now, it""s very unlikely that any of Biden""s Democratic opponents will publicly attack the former vice president over his son – either in Tuesday night""s debate or in the remainder of the primary. In fact, it""s more likely that Democrats in the race will rally around Biden on the issue as a sort of unified front against Trump and his tactics. ""I will be standing firmly in defense of Joe Biden throughout this process because this can in no way besmirch his character, his honor and his incredible service to this country over decades,"" New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker told CNN""s Jake Tapper last week about the Hunter Biden story. But behind the scenes – and among undecided Democratic voters – Hunter Biden""s decision to admit an error in judgment and to do so on the eve of crucial debate (and moment) for his father""s campaign is likely to raise lots of questions. And very few of those questions are good for Joe Biden. Because here""s the thing: Hunter Biden could very well be a problem for his father""s presidential campaign. As the New Yorker""s Adam Entous put it in a lengthy profile of Hunter Biden earlier this year :  ""There is little question that Hunter""s proximity to power shaped the arc of his career, and that, as the former Biden aide told me, ""Hunter is super rich terrain.""""  Hunter Biden""s personal and professional weaknesses are both well-known and well-worn. He had admitted to using cocaine in college and as an adult. He has acknowledged that he has struggled with alcohol addiction. In the early 2000s, he admitted himself into an alcohol rehabilitation center for a month. And his relationships have been tabloid fodder, fairly or not. He and his first wife are divorced. For a time after his brother Beau""s death, Hunter and Beau""s widow were together. In May of this year, he got remarried after a short romance. The Yale law graduate worked for a DC lobbying company although, according to his boss, never on clients that touched his father""s work as a senator from Delaware in any way. (Hunter Biden eventually dropped all of his lobbying clients and resigned from the board of Amtrak when his father was chosen as the vice presidential nominee in 2008.)  (Side bar: Hunter told the New Yorker of the move: ""I wanted my father to have a clean slate. I didn""t want to limit him in any way."")  And during his father""s years alongside Barack Obama in the White House, Hunter started a company with, among others, Chris Heinz, a stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry. The company""s goal was to help foreign businesses expand into the United States and other markets. That""s where he came into contact with Burisma Holdings. What""s clear here is that Hunter Biden has benefited from being the son of Joe Biden. Kind of like how Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump have benefitted from being the children of Donald Trump. In the same way, Donald Trump benefited from being the son of Fred Trump. And on and on it goes. The scions of wealthy or influential – or wealthy and influential – people are often giving a series of helping hands by their parents as they move through life. The question that voters in 2020 will have to answer is whether that fact of life bothers them. Or, more accurately, whether it bothers them enough not to vote for Joe Biden to be the Democratic nominee for president or to be the president come 2021. But, that we are even asking the question isn""t great news for Joe Biden. We know from a slew of polling that a) Democratic voters prize electability over all else and b) Biden is, currently, regarded as the most electable Democratic candidate against Trump. There""s no doubt that watching Trump turn Hunter Biden into a political pinata in the last few weeks will give some undecided Democratic voters pause when they consider what the President might do to the former vice president if the two squared off in the general election.  And, that""s no good for Joe Biden."
cnn|"David Axelrod, a senior CNN political commentator and host of ""The Axe Files,"" was senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chief strategist for the 2008 and 2012 Obama presidential campaigns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN) Much has been made of the spectacular flop that was President Trump's planned campaign re-launch in Tulsa over the weekend.  But one of the most revealing moments got too little attention. It was almost an afterthought in the middle of a nearly two-hour speech and improv when Trump rolled out his principal attack on Joe Biden. And in doing so, Trump also tipped his hand as to why he feared Biden so much that he bought himself an impeachment trying to dirty up the former Vice President. ""If the Democrats gain power, then the rioters will be in charge and no one will be safe and no one will have control,"" proclaimed the self-styled ""law-and-order president"" in the midst of his long, disorderly presentation. ""Joe Biden is not the leader of his party. Joe Biden is a helpless puppet of the radical left."" The lines he appeared to ad-lib about Biden next were unintentionally revealing. ""He's not radical left. I don't think he knows what he is anymore, but he was never radical left.  But he's controlled by the radical left, and now he's really controlled."" Donald Trump is a cultural warrior. His politics depends on mining the fear and resentment of white, working class voters who feel they are on the losing end of economic and demographic change. Joe Biden is culturally inconvenient for Trump's re-election project.  An older, white, Irish Catholic from a working class Pennsylvania family, Biden is just not frightening enough to the voters Trump needs to scare. Trump has recognized this from the start. It's why he leaned so hard on the President of Ukraine last summer to open a baseless investigation into Biden and his son Hunter's board membership of a Ukrainian energy company. Now Trump has the match up he hoped to avoid. And his comments on Saturday underscored both why he fears Biden and what line of attack he will attempt to use to shove the race back into the cultural framework Trump believes will motivate his base. (Whether his base is large enough to win is another story.) Trump's acknowledgment that Biden is not ""radical left,"" was an admission that to try to paint the former VP as extreme was a losing proposition. So instead, Trump will try to portray Biden as the addled, doddering tool, too weak to resist the gravitational pull of the Left. Trump is relying on Biden's occasionally uneven performances to support his argument.  But Biden has been relatively disciplined in his comments since the Covid-19 outbreak began, and his team has been strategic about how and where he has appeared, mainly via Zoom, while it is Trump who has suffered from overexposure. The President who suggested to the nation that consuming disinfectant might be a ready cure for Covid-19 opens himself up to a vicious counterpunch if he stakes his candidacy on attacking another man's mental acuity.  Yet that is where he is going. That is the best shot he has. Biden's most salient qualities -- empathy, decency, experience -- have always offered a valuable contrast to Trump's most glaring deficiencies as a leader. They have become even more pronounced in this period of trial and unrest, during which the cost of Trump's narcissism, divisiveness and inability to manage crises has come into sharper focus. In February, the odds favored the re-election of the president. Today, they have shifted in favor of the challenger.  This was symbolized by the startling sea of empty blue seats Trump confronted in Tulsa, as he offered up a melange of 1970 culture war hits: flag-burning, leftist mob rule, socialism, the confiscation of guns and toppling of Confederate icons. Still, as Trump madly pushes these tried and true buttons, he's not getting the desired reaction. He is underperforming among the non-college white and evangelical voters whose overwhelming support facilitated his narrow electoral victory over Hillary Clinton four years ago. Add this to a seismic move among suburban voters against Trump, who carried the suburbs in 2016, and a lesser but significant shift from voters over 65 who also favored Trump in '16 but now give Biden the edge, and you can see the president's challenge. Biden's age, background and demographic profile may have been an obstacle in nailing down the nomination of an increasingly diverse Democratic Party, but it is working for him now. For a white culture warrior like Trump, old Joe Biden is proving to be a vexing target."
cnn|"(CNN) Cindy McCain, the widow of longtime Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, said Tuesday night on Twitter that she endorses Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. The endorsement -- 12 years after she was a potential First Lady and had the Republican Party behind her and her husband -- follows McCain's appearance in a video about Biden's relationship with McCain at the Democratic National Convention in August. McCain offered her endorsement on Twitter after Biden had told donors she was supporting him. ""My husband John lived by a code: country first. We are Republicans, yes, but Americans foremost. There's only one candidate in this race who stands up for our values as a nation, and that is @JoeBiden,"" she said in a series of tweets. ""Joe and I don't always agree on the issues, and I know he and John certainly had some passionate arguments, but he is a good and honest man. He will lead us with dignity,"" she said . ""He will be a commander in chief that the finest fighting force in the history of the world can depend on, because he knows what it is like to send a child off to fight."" Biden tweeted in reply , ""Cindy — I'm deeply honored to have your support and your friendship. This election is bigger than any one political party. It requires all of us to come together as one America to restore the soul of the nation. Together, we'll get it done."" At a virtual fundraiser Tuesday, Biden had told attendees that Cindy McCain's decision to endorse him followed President Donald Trump's comments , as reported by The Atlantic, referring to those killed and injured in wartime as ""losers"" and ""suckers."" John McCain was a prisoner of war in Vietnam after his plane was shot down on a bombing mission. The injuries he sustained in Vietnam led to lifelong disabilities, including the inability to raise his arms over his head. ""Maybe I shouldn't say it, but I'm about to go on one of these Zooms with John McCain's wife, who is -- first time ever -- is endorsing me because of what he talks about with my son and (John), who are heroes, who served their country. You know he said they're losers, they're suckers,"" Biden said. Cindy McCain discussed her endorsement of Biden in interviews with three broadcast networks Wednesday morning, leaning heavily into his character and empathy in her pitch for the Democratic candidate. McCain said that she is hoping to reach suburban women who may be on the fence with her voice. She said during an interview on ""CBS This Morning"" that she was the one who reached out to Biden about the endorsement because she saw ""a lack of character, integrity, a lack of values, presented by the person who is in charge."" In an interview on NBC's ""Today,"" McCain said the former vice president's empathy played a key factor in her decision to support the Democratic presidential nominee. ""I want to feel like my president cares about me and cares about my country, and Joe Biden does,"" she said, later adding, ""Joe has great empathy for people in this country."" McCain affirmed Biden's comment that the Atlantic report was ""pretty much"" the last straw for her. ""It's a combination of things, but I do believe that our men and women that served in the military are not losers and certainly the men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice are not losers,"" she said. ""I think that respect for the men and women who serve us and served this nation and protect us it's important that we respect and care for them."" Asked if she's disappointed in South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham -- a longtime ally of the late senator -- and other Republicans in their ardent support of Trump, she said ""No."" ""Lindsey is an old and very dear friend and I will always love him and he's just like a member of my family,"" she said. ""Republicans that are -- that believe and are doing what they're doing, it's certainly their prerogative to do so. I just believe, I think things should be different."" McCain said she hopes her husband is ""happy with what I'm doing and believes that I've done the right thing."" The high-profile endorsement from the widow of the 2008 Republican presidential nominee comes as Biden attempts to peel off independents and Republicans alienated by Trump's comments and actions -- including in Arizona , which has emerged as a major electoral battleground. Trump has frequently attacked John McCain by name, including in 2015, when he said he didn't consider McCain a war hero because he preferred those who were not captured. He again went after the late senator Wednesday morning, criticizing him for ""endless wars"" and the state of the Veterans Administration. ""Biden was John McCain's lapdog,"" Trump tweeted. In a video at this year's Democratic convention, Cindy McCain was featured. ""My husband and Vice President Biden enjoyed a 30+ year friendship dating back to before their years serving together in the Senate, so I was honored to accept the invitation from the Biden campaign to participate in a video celebrating their relationship,"" she said in a tweet about the video. This story and headline have been updated with McCain's endorsement. CNN's Arlette Saenz and Caroline Kenny contributed to this report."
cnn|"Speculation is mounting that Vice President Joe Biden might join the presidential race . He should. It would shake things up and inject some character into liberalism. In an ideal world, the Democrats would choose Biden and the Republicans would pick Donald Trump. And then we could have the loudest presidential debates in history. Biden recently told ABC News that there is ""a chance"" that he might run and that, in his opinion, the race is ""wide open."" The former statement seems more probable than the latter. Part of the reason Biden has been quiet about his ambitions is that he likes to take counsel from his family – and the family was recently struck by tragedy when he lost his son, Beau, to brain cancer. Nevertheless, Beau was reportedly in favor of his father running , and his other son is believed to agree . The vice president might not regard this encouragement as enough reason to jump in, however. He may be emotionally exhausted; he may regard his two previous defeats as a sign that he doesn""t have the right stuff. Or, as RealClearPolitics points out , he might look at Hillary Clinton""s 50-point lead in the polls and judge that it""s too high a mountain to climb. But Biden does have some advantages against Clinton that the polls disguise. Two of them are bipartisan appeal and authenticity. To take the first, Biden has developed a reputation within Washington for being able to sit down with people and get things done. He played a key part in budget negotiations that helped prevent the country falling off the fiscal cliff, while his influence over Afghanistan policy is said to be significant. True, there are still signs of the old, gaffe-prone Biden: Recall him telling a largely African-American audience in 2012 that Mitt Romney wanted to enslave them. But errors of judgment do not seem to betray meanness. In a fan letter written for the Financial Times, Edward Luce rightly reminds us that Biden persuaded ultraconservatives like Strom Thurmond to support his legislation back when he was in the Senate. One of Biden""s strongest negotiating tools is the feeling that he is a good old-fashioned patriot with the country""s interests at stake. In addition to that, Biden""s liberalism is of an authentic variety that Clinton struggles to articulate. Of course, her record of fighting for women and children is exemplary and her treatment by parts of the right-wing media has been appalling. But there is still a reason why Bernie Sanders is suddenly just 8 points behind her in New Hampshire , according to a new CNN/WMUR poll. If you""re a liberal who isn""t part of the Hillary cult then it""s very hard to discern why she""s running for the presidency except for the sake of becoming president. Hillary Clinton stands for Hillary Clinton. If you love her, that""s reason enough to vote for her. If you""re ambivalent, then it""s not enough. To policy-oriented liberals, the Biden vs. Clinton difference can be summed up in two words: same-sex marriage. Until very recently, Clinton was still dancing around her earlier opposition to same-sex marriage and her growing awareness that a lot of people now supported it. Her full conversion to the cause largely happened around the time that the Supreme Court was considering legalization. It smacked of opportunism. By contrast, it was Joe Biden""s announcement in a 2012 interview that he thought the time for same-sex marriage had come that pushed President Obama into making a similar statement. According to an account in Jo Becker""s book ""Forcing the Spring,"" not only was the White House taken by surprise by that unscripted TV encounter, but Biden was accused of ""downright disloyalty."" There are few moments in history when policy is genuinely shaped by one individual""s decision to ""go rogue."" It""s highly doubtful that Biden personally made the legalization of same-sex marriage inevitable, but he gave it a nudge. And voters with long memories will remember a blunt man responding to a tough question with honesty – and at great personal risk. In many ways, there""s something very old-fashioned about the thought of a Biden candidacy. He""s been around for decades, he""s white, male, Catholic and of a fairly orthodox liberal hue. But every contest needs a certain dynamic to bring it to life, a dynamic based upon opposing narratives. Clinton will run against her reputation and try to build a whole new one in its place. Joe will just be Joe. And that battle between artifice and integrity could be the story some Democrats have been waiting for.   Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

cnn|"(CNN) Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts endorsed Joe Biden Monday, saying the former vice president ""has the experience and judgment not just to win in November, but to lead our nation after he does."" Moulton, a three-term congressman, dropped out of the 2020 race in August and is now the second former 2020 presidential contender to back Biden. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio announced his support last year. ""There's no better preparation for the White House than the decades Joe Biden has spent serving the country, especially his eight years as vice president,"" Moulton said. ""Most importantly: Joe can win. Joe Biden will beat Donald Trump and unify our country after four years of the most reckless commander-in-chief in American history,"" he added. Moulton is a 41-year-old Marine veteran who focused heavily on national security and his military service during his presidential bid. He joins a group of veteran lawmakers backing the former vice president, including Reps. Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania. Moulton's endorsement comes seven days before the Iowa caucuses. By choosing Biden, Moulton opted not to endorse his home state senator, Elizabeth Warren. She has earned an endorsement from a former 2020 rival -- former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro. In his endorsement statement, Moulton said Biden was the first person to hold a rally for him in his 2014 congressional bid and describes him as a ""friend and mentor.""

cnn|"Washington (CNN) New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker endorsed Joe Biden for president on Monday, the latest high-profile supporter to back the former vice president. ""The answer to hatred & division is to reignite our spirit of common purpose. @JoeBiden won't only win - he'll show there's more that unites us than divides us,"" Booker tweeted . ""He'll restore honor to the Oval Office and tackle our most pressing challenges. That's why I'm proud to endorse Joe."" Booker will join Biden for events in Flint, Michigan , and Detroit, a Biden campaign official told CNN. Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Biden retweeted Booker's post Monday afternoon, saying he is ""incredibly grateful"" for the senator's endorsement. ""Cory — Your leadership has given hope to so many and has inspired our nation to rise to meet the challenges of today,"" he said. ""I'm incredibly grateful for your endorsement — and I look forward to working alongside you to unite the country and defeat Donald Trump."" Booker is the latest former 2020 rival to endorse Biden as he looks to consolidate establishment backing. The New Jersey senator's endorsement -- coming a day after California Sen. Kamala Harris offered her support -- will likely be cited by Biden ahead of critical primary elections on Tuesday. Recently, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg , who were among Biden's most notable challengers in the centrist lane of the Democratic field, also endorsed his candidacy. Biden has a double-digit lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a CNN poll released Monday. Booker, who ended his campaign in January after failing to qualify for the Democratic debate ahead of the Iowa caucuses, occasionally clashed with Biden on a number of issues, including the former vice president's remarks in which he touted his time working with segregationist senators . ""You don't joke about calling black men 'boys.' Men like James O. Eastland used words like that, and the racist policies that accompanied them, to perpetuate white supremacy and strip black Americans of our very humanity,"" Booker said in a statement at the time. When Biden suggested Booker should be the one to apologize, Booker told CNN at the time, ""I was raised to speak truth to power and that I shall never apologize for doing that."" He added, ""And Vice President Biden shouldn't need this lesson."" They also sparred over policy proposals, including criminal justice reform. Debating with Biden on criminal justice reform during the Democratic debate in July, Booker criticized the former vice president. ""There's a saying in my community that you're dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don't even know the flavor,"" he said. ""You need to come to the city of Newark and see the reforms we put in place."" During an interview with CBS on Monday, Booker was asked about his support for Biden after his criticism of the former vice president regarding criminal justice reform. ""Well, first of all, I love Joe Biden. He and I have had a great relationship for a long time,"" he said. ""I wouldn't have run against him if I didn't think I was the best person to be the next president of the United States, but I'm out of the race."" ""And as I look at him,"" he continued. ""I know factually from talking to him that some of my biggest issues like criminal justice reform, like racial justice, like economic justice, that he is going to be a strong leader on that and can actually pull the country together -- the kind of coalitions we need to actually make progress in those areas."" This story has been updated to include additional reporting and background information. CNN's Arlette Saenz contributed to this report."
cnn|"(CNN) Hillary Clinton endorsed Joe Biden during a virtual town hall on Tuesday, putting the support of the Democratic standard bearer from four years ago behind the former vice president and current presumptive presidential nominee. Clinton touted Biden as a ""friend"" and a figure who has been ""preparing for this moment his entire life,"" as she lambasted President Donald Trump as someone who is so ill prepared to be commander in chief that he appears to be just playing the role on television. ""I want to add my voice to the many who have endorsed you to be our president,"" Clinton said. She added, in a nod to the coronavirus, that ""this is a moment where we need a leader, a president, like Joe Biden."" Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Biden called Clinton a ""friend"" and thanked her for the ""wonderful personal endorsement."" The former secretary of state's endorsement was a foregone conclusion -- she had said for months that she would back the eventual nominee -- but it remains a significant boost for Biden because Clinton still enjoys deep support from an array of Democratic voters. She won over 65 million votes four years ago and has proven to be a prolific fundraiser throughout her political career. But Clinton's endorsement also allows Republicans to dredge up every controversy and attack that they used against the 2016 Democratic nominee, something Republicans are eager to do as they look to recreate the strategy that led to President Donald Trump 's victory. ""There is no greater concentration of Democrat establishment than Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton together,"" Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. ""President Trump beat her once and now he'll beat her chosen candidate."" Clinton is the latest top Democrat to back Biden, who after a sluggish start to the primary process saw his fortunes shift by dominating the South Carolina primary and notching a series of key wins on Super Tuesday. Former President Barack Obama, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders all endorsed Biden earlier this month. Clinton sat out the primary fight, telling interviewers repeatedly that she was paying attention to the nominating process from afar. ""I'm just watching and hoping that we nominate whoever is the strongest candidate to take out the current incumbent,"" Clinton said in March, before the field had largely cleared. ""That's the only thing that really matters at the end of the day."" But Clinton stepped up her praise of Biden after Super Tuesday, once the former vice president's only opponent was Bernie Sanders, a politician who Clinton has deep-seated animosity for after the Vermont senator stayed in the 2016 primary for months after his path to winning the nomination then was mostly closed. ""He has the experience,"" Clinton said of the former vice president. ""He knows what needs to be done, he can repair the damage that he would be inheriting."" Clinton endorsing Biden is a reversal of what happened to the duo in 2016, when Biden stepped aside and endorsed his former Senate colleague despite wanting to run himself. The decision partially stemmed from former President Barack Obama firmly getting behind Clinton, all but denying his running mate and vice president the chance to run for the job in 2016. The decision not to run back then has weighed on Biden, though. ""I regret it every day, but it was the right decision for my family and for me,"" Biden said in January 2016, noting the fact that his son, Beau, had died the prior year. ""And I plan on staying deeply involved."" Clinton and Biden share a common story: Both have deep ties to Scranton, Pennsylvania, where Biden was raised and Clinton would spend summers with her grandparents. When Biden endorsed Clinton in 2016, their first event was in the city, where the duo visited Biden's childhood home. Clinton recalled during Tuesday's event how, when she was secretary of state, they had a standing breakfast date once a week, where they would talk often about work but also about family and their lives. Clinton concluded her endorsement with a hope for Biden: ""I wish he were president right now."""
abc|"President Joe Biden gathered a group of ""Dreamers"" at the White House on Friday for a discussion about the importance of the DACA program, which provides deportation relief to young people brought into the country as children. The group of six ""Dreamers,"" a reference to the DREAM Act proposals in Congress that would offer DACA recipients a pathway to citizenship, met with Biden for about 45 minutes. Each engaged on a personal level with the president, according to those in attendance. The latest iteration of an attempt to get ""Dreamers"" legal status was introduced by Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., as the American Dream and Promise Act of 2021. The bill would give an estimated 2.3 million ""Dreamers"" the ability to stay in the U.S. legally. The meeting underscored Biden's efforts to prioritize more permanent forms of relief for ""Dreamers,"" including a pathway to citizenship for those already in the country. It comes as the fate of the DACA program rests, in part, with a federal judge overseeing a lawsuit that argues DACA is unconstitutional. Biden offered each ""Dreamer"" the opportunity to ask him one question during the meeting. Astou Thiane, who was 7-years-old when she immigrated to the U.S. from Senegal, asked Biden to describe the country, a place where he spent a lot of time as vice president. ""All I wanted to know was what was Senegal like,"" she said. ""It was very overwhelming to hear about this place that I hope to be able to return to and visit while also not losing my home here."" Astou became overwhelmed with emotion and described the moment the president embraced her. ""When I was breaking down, he came and he had this moment where he put his forehead on my head and hugged me,"" Astou said. ""And so I think that I believe him, I think that he is going to do his work and to do his all to make sure that the folks who need to hear our stories can hear it so that they're not just thinking this is a political issue."" Astou said she had the opportunity to share with Biden her own experience navigating college admissions as an undocumented Black immigrant, as well as her work with Caribbean and African immigrant families in Canarsie, Brooklyn. A White House readout of the meeting highlighted the president's political goals and his support for a new pathway to citizenship. ""President Biden reiterated his support for Dreamers, TPS holders, farmworkers, and other essential immigrant workers,"" the White House said in a statement. ""The President and the Dreamers also discussed the continued need for immigration reform and the White House""s strong support for the Dream and Promise Act and the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, two bills that have already passed the House with bipartisan support and are awaiting action in the Senate."" The Farm Workforce Modernization Act  would create a system for more than 1 million undocumented farm workers to apply for legal status. Supporters of the DACA program worry that an upcoming ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen of Texas could disrupt the Biden administration's efforts to reinstate it after former President Donald Trump's administration attempted to dismantle it. Instead, they'd like to see the program bolstered by the DREAM Act. But Hanen, an appointee of President George W. Bush, stopped an Obama administration effort in 2015 to create a deferred action program for parents of ""Dreamers,"" known as DAPA, and stakeholders have been waiting months for a ruling in the case brought by Texas, among other states, which charged that DACA undermined the ability of Congress to establish immigration law. Republicans have long argued that President Obama's decision to create DACA was an exercise in unconstitutional executive overreach. Supporters of DACA maintain that it's a necessary and reasonable means of law enforcement discretion given the lack of options presented by current immigration law.

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This is a great milestone. RADDATZ:  The CDC gives vaccinated Americans the green light to go maskless indoors. DR. ROCHELLE WALENSKY, CDC DIRECTOR:  If you are fully vaccinated, you can start doing the things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic. RADDATZ:  Now navigating the patchwork response from states, the new challenges facing schools and businesses. Those questions with CDC Director Rochelle Walensky. And: REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY):  It's a duty for us to stand up and say, no, this was not stolen. RADDATZ:  Liz Cheney defiant, ousted for refusing to repeat Trump's election lies, replaced by the former president's pick. CHENEY:  I think it's dangerous. We have to recognize how quickly things can unravel. RADDATZ:  The interview this morning. (on camera):  And we traveled here to Liz Cheney's Wyoming to see what her ouster from leadership will mean for her future and the future of the GOP.

(END VIDEOTAPE) ANNOUNCER:  From ABC News, it's ""This Week."" Here now, co-anchor Martha Raddatz. RADDATZ:  Good morning, and welcome to ""This Week."" An explosive conflict in the Middle East continues out of control this morning, while, here in America, two seismic shifts playing out this week, one of them in Washington, where Liz Cheney's ouster highlighted Trump's tightening grip on the Republican Party, posing new questions for its path forward. Jon Karl's interview in a moment. The other seismic shift in the fight against the pandemic, on Thursday, the CDC abruptly changing its mask guidance, after more than 400 days, saying fully vaccinated Americans can go maskless indoors, with a few exceptions, the surprise news an about-face from the CDC, shifting from a feeling of impending doom, to cautious optimism, to relaxing mask guidance in just about a month-and-a-half. With only about one-third of the country fully vaccinated, some states, including California and New York, still weighing whether to adopt the change, businesses split on how to respond, the country grappling with concerns about how to enforce these new guidelines to keep all Americans safe. We'll dig in to it all this morning, beginning with CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, who joins me now. Good morning, Dr. Walensky. It was just Tuesday when you sat before a Senate committee, and you were adamant then that masking and social distancing should remain in place. But ""The Washington Post"" is reporting you had already approved the decision to change the guidance. When it was finally announced on Thursday, it came as a huge surprise, and left some administration officials, doctors, businesses off-guard. So, why so suddenly, and why did you not tell the Senate panel what you had decided? WALENSKY:  Thank you. Good morning, Marcia. Thanks -- Martha. Thanks for having me. I am -- you know, the guide -- first of all, let's celebrate this moment. We're at a place in this pandemic. Cases have been coming down more than a third just in the last two weeks. We have vaccine now across this country widely available for anyone who wants it. And we now have science that has really just evolved even in the last two weeks that demonstrates that these vaccines are safe, they are effective, they are working in the population, just as they did in the clinical trials, that they are working against our variants that we have here circulating in the United States, and that, if you were to develop an infection, while -- even if you got vaccinated, that you can't transmit that infection to other people. Some of that science was really evolving as late as last Thursday. And one of the published -- one of the papers, the largest paper, was published from the CDC just the day before yesterday. So, we were actively reviewing that science during the past week. We were making decisions and moving -- moving, and our subject matter experts while working just as I was testifying in front of Congress. And those -- that what was happening. I told the American people I would deliver the science as soon as we have. RADDATZ:  And you said on Friday that the CDC is empowering the American people to make their own decisions about their their own health. But this is all on the honor system and there are people who refuse to get vaccinated, about a quarter of the country, and who oppose mask wearing who could see this as a green light to go wherever they want, putting others at risk, especially in those indoor settings, including children and the immunocompromised. DR. ROCHELLE WALENSKY, CDC: So this is a really important point, and that is the guidance that we released on Thursday is about individuals and what individuals are at risk of doing if they are not vaccinated. If they're vaccinated, they are safe. If they are not vaccinated, they are not safe. They should still be wearing a mask, or better yet, get vaccinated. We also need to say that this is not permission for widespread removal of masks. For those who are vaccinated, it may take some time for them to feel comfortable removing their masks, but also that these decisions have to be made at the jurisdictional level, at the community level. Some communities have been hit harder than others, have lower vaccination rates than others. We want to deliver the science at the individual level, but we also understand that these decisions have to be made at the community level. RADDATZ: But let's talk about the unmasked and the unvaccinated. Lisa Maragakis, an infection disease specialist from Johns Hopkins told ""The Washington Post"" ""There is no way to know who is vaccinated and who is not in most scenarios. The likely result is that almost no one will wear a mask."" She went on to say that the risk to the unvaccinated would dramatically increase as most stop masking. Do you dispute that? WALENSKY: What I would say is those unvaccinated people need to work to protect themselves, need to continue to mask, and better yet, need to get vaccinated. What we're asking our businesses to do as they are starting to think about the guidance as to what this means for their workplaces is to make it easy for paid time off for their employees to get vaccinated. RADDATZ: But COVID is undeniably still a threat, and the CDC has consistently shown us scientific evidence that says you are much safer if two people in a room have masks on. So if you are unvaccinated in that room and someone else comes in without a mask, you're not as safe. WALENSKY: What we would say is if you are unvaccinated in that room, you should get vaccinated. Now the challenge here is that not everybody is eligible for vaccination. So we still have children under the age of 11, and, you know, they should obviously still be wearing masks. So if you are unvaccinated, we are saying, wear a mask. Continue to distance. If you are unvaccinated, and practice all of those mitigation strategies. For the unvaccinated, I want to be very clear, (inaudible) -- RADDATZ: But who is supposed to -- who is supposed to be the vaccination police? You look at Costco and Walmart, these essential workers. What are they supposed to do? They're -- again, there's a quarter of the country that says they will not get vaccinated. WALENSKY: We are asking people to take their health into their own hands, to get vaccinated, and if they don't, then they continue to be at risk. For the unvaccinated, our policy has not changed. This -- we were going to get to a place in this pandemic where vaccinated people were going to be able to take off their masks. We're lucky to be there with the science that we have, and now we have to take this foundational step that is completely based in science, and understand what it means as we open the entire country. RADDATZ: Can I ask you just very quickly about the Yankees? Eight tested positive. They were fully vaccinated. What does that tell you? WALENSKY: We're still working to understand what has happened in that, and we're working with and we're engaging to try to understand the details of that investigation. I don't believe that is complete as of yet. I would consider that, when you look at the details that I""m aware of, seven of those eight were completely asymptomatic. The eighth was a mild case. They were detected on routine testing that generally doesn't happen in many other populations. This is the vaccine working. This means that you didn't get infected -- or you didn't get a severe infection. You didn't require hospitalization. You didn't require death, and most likely those people were not transmitting to other people. So that is what we were working on the vaccine doing. We were hoping it would do. RADDATZ: OK. Thanks for joining us this morning, Dr. Walensky. Despite that CDC guidance, businesses do face uncertainty with how to proceed. To help make sense of some unanswered questions, let's bring in Chief Business and Economics Correspondent Rebecca Jarvis. Rebecca, good morning to you. Businesses really were caught off guard by the new CDC guidelines, causing some real confusion. But ultimately are businesses happy about this overall? REBECCA JARVIS, CHIEF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT: Well, good morning, Martha. The reality here is if you are running a business or managing people, your job over this last year has been a hybrid of putting out fires and behaving as a therapist to your employees and for a lot of the businesses, they were caught off guard by this signal. The fact that it came out of the blue and wasn't telegraphed over time as an on and off switch became something to manage with their employees. But overall, the businesses I""m talking to, the CEOs, the founders of companies are happy about this because it signals, Martha, a return to normal. RADDATZ:  And you mention the employees. We have also heard real concern from employees who know this is really essentially an honor system, and who didn't sign up to be vaccination police. So they must be concerned. JARVIS:  Well, and yeah. That's what we've heard especially from some of the trade groups, retail, food service, that employees should not be placed in this position of having to ask customers as they walk through the door whether or not they have been vaccinated. We've already seen over the course of the pandemic, issues around mask wearing. Now there's this potential for new issues around who's been vaccinated which is why we've heard so many companies speak out. And it's also why, Martha, you're seeing a number of companies like Walmart, like Costco, Publix among them saying, we're going to keep this on the honor system. So you're not going to see one of our employees walk up and ask someone to wear a mask. They're just as company is saying, wear a mask if you haven't been vaccinated. If you have been vaccinated and you're within the time frame, then you can welcome -- you can be welcomed into our stores without one on. RADDATZ:  And, Rebecca, just a final question, in terms of vaccinated employees, we heard Delta Airlines this week say that any new employees would have to be vaccinated. What's the legal question here? Can employers say, if you work here, you have to be vaccinated? JARVIS:  On the surface, legally, yes. They should be able to do that, but a lot of companies I""ve talked to behind the scenes are still worried about what legal ramifications there could be if they enforce a vaccine mandate which is why so many are now nudging things along. Kroger, for example, giving out $100 to its employees who go out and get vaccinated. American Airlines giving $50 to their employees as a gift card. So, you're going to see, I think, Martha, a lot more nudging than you will see mandating on this issue -- Martha. RADDATZ:  And we'll keep an eye on that. Thanks for joining us this morning, Rebecca. Now to that shakeup within the House Republican caucus. Congresswoman Liz Cheney was removed from her leadership post for speaking out about former President Donald Trump's election lies, despite voting with Trump 92 percent of the time compared to just 77 percent for her replacement, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who has now become one of Trump's staunchest defenders. The story is more than just a leadership contest. It's about the future of the Republican Party, the resistance to the truth, and the future of democracy. As the drama consumed Washington, I headed to the open terrain of Wyoming to see what Cheney's constituents thought of her removal, and Trump's continued influence on the party. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RADDATZ (voice-over):  Wyoming is both stunning and bleak. Vast stretches of rangeland nestled in the Rocky Mountains, the nation's tenth largest state, but the least populous. Fewer than 600,000 people live here. That's a smaller number than in Washington, D.C. But with all eyes on its lone congresswoman this week, what happens here takes on an outsized role. Wyoming is the reddest of red states. Liz Cheney had no trouble with re-election here in 2020. She won every single county in the entire state except one. But these Wyoming voters, they love Donald Trump as well. Trump beat Joe Biden overwhelmingly with 70 percent of the vote. The question now, what happens to Cheney? Do you think it does come down to, who do you like better, Liz Cheney or Donald Trump? MAX NICHOLSON, ROCK SPRINGS RESIDENT:  Unfortunately, I do think there is a lot of that. There is a lot of anger and dissatisfaction and Trump has found a way to tap into that. RADDATZ:  Rock Springs resident and lifelong Republican, Max Nicholson (ph), says the GOP is putting loyally to Trump over legislative record. NICHOLSON:  I don't think there's anybody in the House who has a more conservative voting record than Liz Cheney. RADDATZ:  But cattle rancher Drew Hartley (ph) says Cheney""s record aside, she has gone too far. DREW HARTLEY, CATTLE RANCHER:  Hearing her rhetoric about her dislike for him really has, I would say put a bad taste in my mouth, but it's made me to where she's dividing the party. RADDATZ:  The Republican Party today is Donald Trump's party. HARTLEY:  I liked his principles, I liked his values in that respect and the things that he -- the results that he produced, but I didn't always like what he had to say. A little -- a little kindness goes a long way and he -- he could have displayed that a lot more often. RADDATZ: So when you hear Donald Trump say the election was stolen, what do you think of that? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, he's entitled to his opinion. I mean, that's the best thing I can say to that. RADDATZ (voice over): Dennis Loughlin (ph), the owner of a Harley Davidson dealership in Green River, who identifies as a libertarian, isn't bothered by Trump's questioning of the election either. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think the media has twisted and turned things and made the narrative fit whatever they wanted to the point that we'll never know. I'd put it up there with, you know, who shot JFK. RADDATZ (on camera): So Wyoming loved Liz Cheney before. We'll see what happens next. But they really love Donald Trump. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's the fracturing of the Republican Party and the fracturing of what's happened here in the state of Wyoming. RADDATZ (voice over): State Senator Wendy Schuler (ph) likes Trump but didn't like how Cheney was ousted. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She's been a pretty good warrior for the Republican Party and a pretty good leader. And she's done some great things for Wyoming. And I think she just wasn't Trumpy enough, if that's a good way to put it. RADDATZ (on camera): It certainly bothers Liz Cheney that Donald Trump continues to say the election was stolen. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm -- I'm not sure yet what I believe on that. I think she's kind of stayed in the past and I think he has. And I think it would be better for both of them if we just move on and let's see what we can do to -- to -- to make our country better and united. (END VIDEOTAPE) RADDATZ: Liz Cheney sat for an interview Friday with our chief Washington correspondent Jon Karl, and he began by asking about the selection of Elise Stefanik as her replacement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JONATHAN KARL, ABC ""THIS WEEK"" CO-ANCHOR: What does it say about the party choosing somebody to replace you who was effectively chosen by Donald Trump and is saying what he's been saying, that -- those very lies that you're talking about? REP. LIZ CHENEY, (R) WYOMING: I think it's dangerous. I think that -- that we have to recognize how quickly things can unravel. We have to recognize what it means for the nation to have a former president who has not conceded and who continues to suggest that our electoral system cannot function, cannot do the will of the people. To -- to cause that kind of questioning about our process, frankly, it's the same kinds of things that the Chinese Communist Party says about democracy: that it's a failed system, that America is a failed nation. I won't be part of that. And I think it's very important for Republicans who won't be part of that to stand up and speak out. KARL: When you say dangerous -- dangerous, how? Are you suggesting that January 6th could happen again, or maybe, maybe something worse? CHENEY: I think there's no question. I mean, you know, we've now seen the consequences. We've -- we've seen how far the president, the -- President Trump was willing to go. We've seen not only his, his provocation of the attack, but his refusal to send help when it was needed, his refusal to immediately say, ""stop."" And that in and of itself, in my view, was a very clear violation of his oath and of his duty. KARL: Now, the speaker, along with at least one Republican, key Republican, have announced an agreement on a commission to look into what happened on January 6th. Should Kevin McCarthy be willing to speak, testify before that commission? After all, he is one of the few people that we know of that was actually talking to Donald Trump while the attack was taking place. CHENEY: He absolutely should, and I wouldn't be surprised if he were subpoenaed. I think that he very clearly and said publicly that he's got information about the president's state of mind that day. KARL: So you would welcome a subpoena for Kevin McCarthy to testify to that commission? CHENEY: I would anticipate that. I would hope he doesn't require a subpoena, but I wouldn't be surprised if he, if he were subpoenaed. KARL: How many of your colleagues actually believe that stuff, actually believe the election was stolen? CHENEY: I think it's a relatively small number. KARL: Adam Kinzinger says it's a handful. Is that, do you think that""s right? CHENEY: I think that's probably right. KARL: So they're just saying it to placate Donald Trump? CHENEY: You know, I think that we as a party are in a situation with respect to the former president that is really dangerous. KARL: Did you vote for Donald Trump in 2020? CHENEY: I did. KARL: Do you regret that vote? CHENEY: Look, I think that the -- KARL: I mean, how could you not regret that vote, given what's happened? CHENEY: Yeah. I mean, look, I was never going to support Joe Biden, and I do regret the vote. I think that it was a vote based on policy, based on, sort of, substance and what I know in terms of the kinds of policies he put forward that were good for the country, but that I -- I think it is fair to say I regret the vote. KARL: If the Republican Party nominates Donald Trump in 2024, could you stay in a Republican Party that decides that he should be the nominee again? CHENEY: I will do everything that I can to make sure he's not the nominee and, you know, everything necessary to make sure that he never gets anywhere close to the Oval Office again. KARL: But would you remain in the party if he were the nominee? CHENEY: I will not support him and will do everything I can to make sure that doesn't happen. KARL: How concerned should Republicans be about the fact that you've lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections? CHENEY: Very concerned. I think that -- that as a party, we really do have to say, ""What do we stand for? What do we believe in?"" And we also have to stop -- and look, I think the Democrats need to stop doing this, too -- we have to stop incentivizing unserious behavior among our elected officials. We have to stop incentivizing vitriol. We have to stop incentivizing people to, to show up here and think, you know, the goal is to be a social media star. KARL: Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, talking about you, said, """"She who thinks she leads, but has no followers, is only taking a walk."" Liz, I am afraid you are only a woman taking a walk."" Does she have a point? I mean, there was really nobody that came to your defense. I mean, there were a couple of members, Adam Kinzinger, Ken Buck. You were -- you were pretty much alone on this. CHENEY: Well, I think that it is very important to stand up for what's right. I know that there are many members who have expressed concern about their own security. And I think that's an important point to think about as well, that we now live in a country where members' votes are affected because they're worried about their security, they're worried about threats on their lives. So I think that's part of it. But but, look, you know, there's no question but that at this moment, the majority of the Republican Party is not where I am. But it's my responsibility as an elected official, it's my responsibility as a leader to lead and, and to tell the truth. KARL: You know, I've seen other Republicans over the past four and a half years who stood up to Donald Trump. Jeff Flake comes to mind. Bob Corker comes to mind. There are others, and they're gone. I mean, he won, they came out, they made the statement, they stood up to him and they were effectively run out of Republican politics. How, or -- why will it be any different with you? CHENEY: One thing that makes it different is January 6th. This isn't about policy. It's not about whether you like his tweets or you don't like his tweets. It's about the attack on the Capitol. And the fundamental attack and continued -- and that's important -- continued assault on the foundations of the republic. You know, once January 6th happened, that that's the end. And that has been, I think, the most disappointing thing to me, that that more of my colleagues have not been willing to stand up and say that can never happen again. KARL: Well, in fact, what we heard this week is we saw members of the Republican Party in the House basically deny it happened. We saw one Republican congressman say that the -- that the protesters were orderly. Another one said they saw no evidence that Trump supporters were actually among the rioters. I mean, what does it say that some are able to erase the memory of what happened on January 6th? CHENEY: It's indefensible. I will never forget seeing the law enforcement officers, the members of the SWAT team, the rapid response forces, seeing them and their exhaustion. And they had been through hand-to-hand combat and -- and, you know, people died. And the notion that this is just, you know -- the notion that this was somehow a tourist event is disgraceful and despicable. And, you know, I won't be part of whitewashing what happened on January 6. Nobody should be part of it. And people ought to be held accountable. KARL: What was your experience on that day during the riot? Did you feel like you were in danger? CHENEY: One thing I will never forget, I was on the aisle and I looked across the aisle. Jamie Raskin was sitting on the other side of the aisle, and you could hear the mob coming. And he looked at me and he showed me his phone, and he said, ""Liz, there's a Confederate flag flying in the Rotunda."" And that moment of -- this cannot be happening in the United States of America. KARL: Jim Jordan, talking about a possible Trump 2024 run, said there's no way he is losing. He's going to win the Republican primary and he's going to be president if he decides to run. Now, based on today's facts, he's right, isn't he, about the primary part, at least? I mean, there's nobody -- there's not even a close second out there, is there? CHENEY: I think Jim's wrong. It's not the first time Jim has been wrong, and I'm sure it won""t be the last time. But, but he is wrong. And I think there are millions and millions of Republicans who won't let that happen again. KARL: What will it take for you to run for president? CHENEY: I am right now focused on my reelection in Wyoming -- KARL: I understand, of course you are and you very much need to be -- CHENEY: That""s right, thank you -- KARL: But what would it take for you to run for president? CHENEY: Look, as I said -- KARL: I heard you on the radio in New Hampshire today, (CROSSTALK) so it's not too far out of your mind. CHENEY: Look, I think it's really important that we as Republicans be in a position where we can present to our voters, to my voters in Wyoming and to our voters across the country, a set of issues and policies that -- that reflect conservative principles. But also hope and opportunity and inspiration. KARL: Would your father like to see you run? CHENEY: Well, yeah, but he's my dad, so. (LAUGHTER) He's not objective. KARL: Good point. (END VIDEOTAPE) RADDATZ:  And Jon Karl joins us now. Jon, is Liz Cheney really considering a run for president in 2024? KARL:  It sure sounds that way to me, Martha. I mean, first of all, she was joking a bit about her father, but her father is her most important political adviser. And she told me that he does want her to run. And, look, she believes that Donald Trump poses a threat,Well, not just to the Republican Party, but to the country. She needs a platform to be able to make that case. A run for president is such a platform. But she has a much bigger and more immediate problem, and that is reelection in Wyoming, as you heard from those Wyoming voters. And I put some of what those voters told you directly to her and said, how would she respond? She said she will go across the state, she will talk directly to some of the very people you spoke to. And she says: ""I think the issue really is the ongoing and continued threat that the former president is posing."" That is a tough argument to make in Wyoming, which Donald Trump won by -- with 70 percent of the votes, and still, by all counts, remains very, very popular. RADDATZ:  Indeed, he is. I saw it myself. KARL:  Yes. RADDATZ:  Thanks so much, Jon. A great interview. Our roundtable joins me live on set next. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) RADDATZ:  Our powerhouse team live, on set, in person. The roundtable is next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ELISE STEFANIK (R-NY):  I wanted to thank my colleagues for the opportunity to serve as the House Republican conference chair. I have prioritized listening to all members of our Republican conference, and my focus is on unity because that's what the American people, and that's what our voters deserve. I also want to thank President Trump for his support. He is a critical part of our Republican team. (END VIDEO CLIP) MARTHA RADDATZ, ABC ""THIS WEEK"" CO-ANCHOR:  Elise Stefanik, the new number three in the House Republican conference. Let's talk about that and more with our roundtable: chief justice correspondent Pierre Thomas, chief White House correspondent Cecilia Vega, chief congressional correspondent Rachel Scott, and senior White House correspondent Mary Bruce. It's so great to see you all face to face, and on set this morning. And, Rachel, I want to -- I want to start with you. We all listened to Jon's interview. We heard from those voters in Wyoming. You're on Capitol Hill covering Liz Cheney every day. You heard her earlier. She's going to do everything possible to stop a political comeback by Donald Trump. Is that really possible, or is she just doing herself in? RACHEL SCOTT, ABC NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Martha, I think in a lot of ways this is a Republican Party that has actually moved closer to Donald Trump since January 6th. So, on Capitol Hill, I was asking Republican after Republican this week, including Senator Lindsey Graham, can the Republicans win back the House and the Senate without Trump? And I got one-word answers, no. And so, if you look across the country, you see Trump""s influence. You see it in the type of laws that are being passed when it comes to voting rights from state to state. You see it in the type of candidates that are winning these special elections. And I think you also see it in the backlash that the Republicans who were criticizing Trump are getting back home. Mitt Romney booed, Liz Cheney censured. So, yes, she may be emboldened, but Trump still has the grip on this party. RADDATZ:  And, Cecilia, you obviously covered the Trump White House. You""re covering the Biden White House. What's happening with Cheney is really at its core about the truth. CECILIA VEGA, ABC NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  It has been so fascinating to watch the Republicans this week kind of twist themselves into these creative knots and use this word salad to avoid saying that Biden fairly won this White House, and what they're doing and this is as you said, they now created this red line for anyone, any Republican in their party who dares to go out and say that Biden was duly elected. That's really dangerous for them going forward given the contradiction that it creates. They""ve got to go out now and try to win votes, given this case that they""ve made, that the system fundamentally is flawed. I think Lindsey Graham actually said it best this week when he said that -- he basically put it out there and is not hiding anything. He said, Republicans would be crazy to walk away from Donald Trump. If he left the party, he believes they would take half of the party with him. So, now, they're in this kind of quagmire. Do they stick with this? And it seems like they're going to. This is very much the party of Donald Trump, and the big lie. RADDATZ:  And, Mary Bruce, so what does Joe Biden do about it? MARY BRUCE, ABC NEWS SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  That is a very good question. I mean, this is certainly a far, far cry from the Republican Party that Biden often brags about being able to work with when he was a senator. The White House when pressed on this will say, look. Biden has a record of working with people when disagree with him, but this is different from that. I mean, I think the big question is, how do you work with an opposing party -- how does Biden work with them when they still continue to perpetuate this lie that he wasn""t legitimately elected? I mean, it was political whiplash this week to see Kevin McCarthy lead the charge to kick out Liz Cheney for telling the truth about Trump. And then just hours later, he's sitting in the Oval Office trying to hammer out a bipartisan infrastructure deal. And then he comes out and tries to claim to all of us reporters there at the White House that no one is questioning the legitimacy of the 2020 election. That's just blatantly not true. I mean, I think time will tell whether this will make it less likely than it already is that the Republicans and Democrats in this White House can work together. But what we do know is that every single day, the Republicans are consumed by this kind of infighting is a day that they are not united fighting against Joe Biden, and that's a good thing for this president. RADDATZ:  Democrats and Republicans were united, finally worked out an agreement to investigate the January 6th attack. There are Republicans, however, who are still downplaying this. But will that commission -- will that -- will that investigation merit any changes within the Republican Party, do you think? PIERRE THOMAS, ABC NEWS CHIEF JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Martha, it needs to because we found out that lies have consequences. And I had the difficult job of talking to some of those officers who were there that day, who fought the insurrectionists. One officer talked about being called the N-word times in the U.S. Capitol. Another officer talked about being in a medieval fight, literally, where some of the insurrectionists were yelling, kill him with his own gun. So this commission needs to do the work, and they need to get answers because lies have real consequences. MARTHA RADDATZ, ABC ""THIS WEEK"" CO-ANCHOR: But -- but, Pierre, I -- I will go back on that. They know that. There are a lot of Republicans who already know that. So do you think that commission will change any minds? Will -- will it change the tenor of what they're saying? THOMAS: You know, transparency can be disinfectant. And to the degree they can get those images out there yet again, to the degree they can get those questions answered and talked (ph), it would be interesting to have some of those officers come and testify before the commission. I think that would make a world of a difference where they could look those officers in the eyes and let them tell them what happened. RADDATZ: And -- and, Cecilia, there does seem to be some traction on infrastructure. The president does continue to talk to Republicans. But he has set that sort of unofficial date of Memorial Day for getting this done. Is that really a possibility? CECILIA VEGA, ABC NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Are you asking me if we're going to have another infrastructure week after Memorial Day? RADDATZ: Or -- or maybe next -- maybe next Memorial Day, right? VEGA: All of that infrastructuring (ph). Well, at this point, they can't even agree on what infrastructure actually is. The Democrats clearly want this to be this big, broad brush strokes of infrastructure. Things like, you know, free pre-k, home health care. Democrat -- Republicans say infrastructure is basically bridges and roads. Memorial Day is in just two weeks. Look, I think when you talk to people privately, both on The Hill and in the White House, there is a consensus that right now they feel like more progress has been made on this front than ever before. I think this week, this coming week, the next few days are going to be very telling. Essentially what happened after this meeting that Mary was talking about was the president said, OK, everybody go back to their respective sides. Republicans, come back, bring me your new proposal. And -- and sincerely folks feel like -- like perhaps they are inching towards something. I think Memorial Day is probably pretty optimistic, but there is a -- a consensus privately among some Democrats, at least in the White House, that they are going to have to start to peel off and -- and separate this -- this human infrastructure, the universal pre-k, things like that. But, you know, there is an issue among Democrats on Capitol Hill. They're saying we cannot forsake these main issues and our -- these priorities in our party for the sake of bipartisanship. So even if the president agrees to -- to compromise on some of these things, he's still got to go back and deal with -- with these issues in the party as to whether they -- they want to fund these separately and go at it alone. RADDATZ: And, Mary, are you seeing changes? Are you seeing bipartisanship? MARY BRUCE, ABC NEWS SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: I mean there certainly is more of a willingness and more of an effort to try and get something done here than we saw, for instance, during the first COVID relief bill that they -- the last big negotiations. And the president has signaled a willingness at least to negotiate the scope and how to pay for all of this. And this week will be a huge test for this when -- when Republicans come back with that counterproposal. But I think the question then becomes, how are you going to pay for all of this? You know, the president has made clear he's not going to budge on those human infrastructure aspects. Maybe you do see a skinny bill that's just focused on roads, rails and bridges, the traditional infrastructure that Republicans want. But Republicans are making it clear, they are not going to raise taxes on the most wealthy to pay. So the -- so the question then becomes to Joe Biden, are you willing to do a deal here even if the bill isn't fully paid for? RADDATZ: And -- and, Rachel, you spoke with the very powerful Democratic Senator Joe -- Joe Manchin earlier this week. How much appetite is there among Democrats for a narrower package from your vantage point? RACHEL SCOTT, ABC NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, and Senator Joe Manchin said exactly what Cecilia just said, now is the time to start separating the traditional infrastructure out from this massive package and work on getting bipartisan support for that. We heard President Biden keep saying doing nothing is not an option, that maybe Democrats could go at this alone if there is not bipartisan support. But the reality is, is that Senator Joe Manchin wants bipartisan support. So he's going to need to get his own party on the same page first. RADDATZ: And -- and, Pierre, I -- I want to turn to another very important story this week, and that was the Colonial Pipeline, the ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline. It caused fuel shortages. It caused lines in gas lines. Explain how something like this could happen. THOMAS: Martha, I think this was the week where hacking went from an issue that was the stuff of science fiction and movies and people being a little bit annoyed, to a moment of awakening because people could not get gas, millions of them could not go to a gas station, and the reason was that a group of criminals used software developed by Russians that essentially hack into Colonial Pipeline's computers, allowing them to steal data and also, according to our sources, potentially allowing them to lock up those computers so that the company itself could not use them. So that company was under enormous pressure to pay a ransom that we are told that was in the low millions. Now, we don't know all the details of it, and there are various ways and cut-outs that this could have been done. THOMAS:  But I can tell you that my law enforcement sources are stunned at the level of the increase in ransomware attacks, a 300 percent increase in the last year... (CROSSTALK) THOMAS:  ... worth $350 million to... (CROSSTALK) RADDATZ:  Can more be done here?  Can more be done?  There has to be able to -- or do these companies weigh the risk versus the cost of doing more to stop these attacks? THOMAS:  I think the thing that struck me most in my conversations were law enforcement people telling me, ""Pierre, at the end of the day, these companies control how they protect their computers.  We can't make them do anything.  And in some cases, we can't even make them tell us when they've been hit with a ransomware attack."" So they know that this is going to be a collective effort by the government and private companies to improve security, and they have been warning them for years to take care of this issue.  It has not happened.  The one thing that the government said that you can expect is that they are -- will go after some of these organizations in terms of their structure and also try to do away with the way that they can get their money. THOMAS:  And, Cecilia, the Biden administration really seemed caught off guard by this as well.  So what do they do? VEGA:  Well, the Republicans were certainly quick to point out these mixed messages that came from the White House in the early days of this, where the White House was essentially saying there weren't even supply shortages, and there were. Look, the White House was -- this was a full-fledged public relations campaign, all hands on deck.  They brought in the big names, Cabinet officials, into the briefing room.  The president was briefed every day.  The last thing this administration wanted was to see long lines and images of folks lined up at gas pumps with gas shortages. But I think Pierre -- what Pierre is saying is exactly right.  What this really exposed this week for all of Washington, including this White House, was how limited government is in what they can do with these private companies when it comes to forcing them to beef up their cybersecurity efforts. Because, reportedly, Colonial, it took four days for them to even have substantive conversations with authorities.  And when you talk to folks in the White House and in the administration privately, they were very frustrated by that. So you saw the reaction -- you asked what can the president can do.  He's trying.  They signed this -- he signed this very lengthy executive order.  But, you know, the reality is the administration, the government, is limited in scope in how much they can force these companies to beef up these networks.  So they're really, sort of, at the -- it's at the whim of these companies to do more. RADDATZ:  It -- it certainly is.  OK.  The round table is sticking around with us.  But, first, further escalation overnight as the violence between Israelis and Palestinians enters a second week.  We're live on the ground with the very latest. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) RADDATZ:  A live look at the destruction in Israel amid another day of violence between Israelis and Palestinians.  We'll go straight to the scene in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QUESTION:  Is Prime Minister Netanyahu doing enough to stop this violence there from escalating? BIDEN:  There has not been a significant overreaction. The question is, how do they get to a point where there is a significant reduction in the attacks? REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY):  This is about an imbalance of power. The president and many other figures this week stated that Israel has a right to defense. But do Palestinians have a right to survive? (END VIDEO CLIP) RADDATZ:  President Biden and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez weighing in on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There were new attacks overnight after the president spoke to leaders of both sides about the recent violence, which has left nearly 200 dead, most of them Palestinian. Our chief national correspondent, Matt Gutman, is on the scene in Israel with the latest. Matt, it looks like you're right in the middle of it. MATT GUTMAN, ABC NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  A rocket exploded about 20 yards from where we're standing right now. The majority of the population of Israel, Martha, has experienced the sirens and the explosions. The family here was having its Sabbath meal. They heard the sirens, managed to sprint to a bomb shelter. But a man across the street was killed. Now, civilians on both sides have borne the brunt of this, overnight, the fiercest Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip that we have seen so far, Palestinian health officials reporting more than 33 dead, the majority of them women and children. Parts of Gaza today, Martha, look like a moonscape, dozens of buildings flattened. But one of them, in particular, drew intense international condemnation against Israel. That tower block you are seeing housed Al-Jazeera, the Associated Press, and many other international media agencies. Israel says it was targeting Hamas installations, but it has provided no evidence of that. And perhaps encapsulating the misery that we have seen in Gaza is the story of Muhammad Hadidi. You can see him right there atop that pile of debris screaming out, wailing. He was told that he lost his wife and five children in that building. But, an hour later, he was led into a Gaza hospital, and there was his sole surviving family member, 5-month-old Omar. Now, Israel is telling us that the pace and intensity of rocket attacks is unprecedented, nearly 3,000 so far, five times what it was in the previous conflict. But now we're starting to hear murmurs from the Israeli military that this campaign is not going to be indefinite, that it might only last a few more days -- Martha. RADDATZ:  We will keep our eye on that, Matt. Thanks so much for joining us there this morning. More from the roundtable and the foreign policy crisis facing the new administration. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MARTHA RADDATZ, ABC ""THIS WEEK"" CO-ANCHOR:  Cecilia, Pierre, Mary and Rachel, back with us in just 60 seconds. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) RADDATZ:  And we're back now with more from the roundtable. Cecilia, let's pick up where Matt Gutman left off. Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner were behind the so-called Abraham Accords between Israel and some Arab neighbors. Donald Trump said that would mean the dawn of a new Middle East. But that certainly has not happened. CECILIA VEGA, ABC NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, and this was something that was seen as a huge -- at least among Republicans, anyway -- a huge feather in the cap of Donald Trump when it came to international diplomacy and Middle East issues. The president said this was the foundation for comprehensive peace potentially in the entire region. You know, it wasn't just the Republicans, though. The Biden administration supported this. Tony Blinken came out and said that this was something he would like to see expanded and have other Arab nations in the region join. I think a lot of experts are seeing what's happening now given all the violence and think the likelihood of more countries joining on to these accords is slim to none. What we're seeing from the bidden administration right now is they are walking this very fine line. They are very much pushing private diplomatic diplomacy. That is -- that is their goal right now. But a lot of folks are very critical of the administration, particularly in their own party. You're seeing folks like Bernie Sanders come out and not happy with the president. They would like to see them take a more forceful tone in support of Palestine and the issues that are happening in Gaza right now. But right now you're seeing a very traditional approach from -- from the Biden administration. RADDATZ: And -- and, Mary, if this escalates and -- and Matt said he thought it might die down in the next few days, he's hearing rumblings of that. But if this escalates, do they have a plan? MARY BRUCE, ABC NEWS SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: They're going to need to come up with something more. I think, so far, when we've pressed them on this, as Cecilia notes, they've been really pointing to these behind the scenes conversations. I mean, look, it's no secret that this was not high on Joe Biden's priority list, right? He made very clear coming into office he was going to focus far more on his domestic agenda when it comes to foreign policy, far more focused on things like competing with China. I mean the biggest change that we've seen in the early months of this administration has simply been deprioritizing in many ways the Middle East. While -- while he was critical, Biden was, of many of Donald Trump's policies, he hasn't taken big steps to reverse a lot of them. And they'd had this very muted response this week. It's getting them some pushback. The question now is, how long can this really last? RADDATZ: And -- and, Rachel, Cecilia alluded to it, but there is this big divide on Capitol on hill on how to approach especially Israel. RACHEL SCOTT, ABC NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and even Sen. Bob Menendez, who has big one of the strongest supporters of Israel, came out and said that the killing of Palestinians in the area is deeply troubling. And on the House floor this week we saw these fiery and really emotional speeches. We played that soundbite from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, pushing back against this idea of, Israel has the right to defend itself, instead saying that we should be asking ourselves whether Palestinians have the right to survive. And then Rashida Tlaib, this is very personal for her. She is Palestinian. She has family in the area. She says when you read those White House statements and the statements from President Biden and the secretary of state, it's almost as if the suffering of Palestinians doesn't even exist. RADDATZ: This is something I have covered for 30 years, and it is just the ugliest cycle over and over again. And -- and, Pierre, I -- I want to end with you here. Security officials are obviously watching this closely. There have been protests in support largely of -- of the Palestinians. Are -- are officials worried that this could spread? PIERRE THOMAS, ABC NEWS CHIEF JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: There's always the potential of spillover effect. And some officials are quietly very concerned that ISIS and/or al Qaeda might try to exploit the situation. RADDATZ: And -- and -- and what do they see now? I -- I mean ISIS and al Qaeda, but throughout the region, more protests? THOMAS: It's really the lone wolf effect that people who are identified with the Palestinians, for example will be frustrated, angry, and then they might try to do something here at home. RADDATZ: OK. Thanks so much. It is great to be back together again. But that's all for us today. Thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us. Have a great day."
abc|"Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said Friday it was ""indefensible"" that some House Republicans have minimized the Jan. 6 riot and downplayed violence between Capitol Police officers and former President Donald Trump 's supporters who attempted to disrupt the congressional count of the 2020 election results. ""The notion that this was somehow a tourist event is disgraceful and despicable,"" Cheney said in an interview with ABC's ""This Week"" Co-Anchor Jonathan Karl. ""I won't be part of whitewashing what happened on Jan. 6. Nobody should be a part of it and people ought to be held accountable."" At a Wednesday House hearing , several Republicans dismissed the storming of the U.S. Capitol , which led to the death of five people, including a Capitol Police officer. ""It was not an insurrection,"" said Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga. ""If you didn't know that TV footage was a video from (Jan. 6), you would actually think it was a normal tourist visit."" Cheney, who was replaced Friday as the House GOP conference chair, said she has spoken repeatedly to the mother of Brian Sicknick , the Capitol Police officer who died after clashing with protesters, and Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone , who suffered numerous injuries battling rioters outside the Capitol. The Wyoming Republican recalled her experience on the House floor as the Capitol was under siege. ""(Democratic Rep.) Jamie Raskin was sitting on the other side of the aisle and you could hear the mob coming, and he looked at me and showed me his phone and said, 'Liz, there's a Confederate flag flying in the Rotunda,'"" she said. ""And that moment of, you know, this cannot be happening in the United States of America."" ""I think everybody understood after that, that it could not be happening, and that it could not happen again and that people had to be held accountable,"" she added. ""It is disgraceful that so many Republicans since then have tried to sort of whitewash or gloss over what happened."" While Trump spent years sowing doubts about the election results -- and even raised the possibility that he wouldn't accept the results in 2016 had he lost to Hillary Clinton -- Cheney told Karl that Trump's unwillingness to abide by a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election ""was certainly a concern"" for her. ""After the (Dec. 14 electoral college vote), it became very clear in very concerning ways that Donald Trump was willing to do potentially anything to stay in office,"" Cheney said. She said her fears grew when Trump's campaign attorneys refused to argue in court the claims of fraud his key surrogates, including attorney Rudy Giuliani, were making in public. ""You can begin to see the real danger, between what they were attempting to do in terms of making these claims, lying to the American people and the press conferences, and what had actually happened, what they were actually claiming -- and I think that that was a moment of recognizing real danger,"" Cheney said. The Wyoming Republican pushed back against criticism of her greeting President Joe Biden when he addressed Congress from the House chamber on April 28. ""I will always, no matter who the president is, always greet them,"" she said. ""That is the place we have to get back to, understanding that we ought to be having really close battles about policy."" ""I'm willing to put that up against theirs and have that debate on substance, and recognize they are not our enemies,"" she continued. ""They're our political opponents, and we've got to be able to win that debate and stop some of the really vitriolic hatred that has been characteristic of so much of our politics recently."" Cheney also criticized House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., for the campaign text message he sent to supporters after his infrastructure meeting with Biden and congressional leaders at the White House on Wednesday, which referred to the president as ""corrupt Joe Biden."" ""It's unserious behavior,"" Cheney said. ""That is not the way to go about actually getting a bipartisan agreement. It's also true that the White House has been saying they want bipartisanship but not very willing to actually take any Republican ideas into account."" Cheney has thrown her full weight behind blocking an attempt by Trump to return to the Oval Office and scoffed at members of her conference who have predicted a Trump 2024 victory. She told Karl that Rep. Jim Jordan's prediction that Trump is a shoo-in for the Republican nomination and the presidency if he chooses to run is ""wrong."" ""Jim has been wrong before, and I'm sure it won't be the last time,"" Cheney said of the Ohio Republican. ""But he is wrong. And I think there are millions and millions of Republicans who won't let that happen again."" Cheney has not ruled out a presidential run of her own if that's what it takes to keep Trump from reclaiming the White House in 2024. ""I think we have to get back to the days where we're able to say to people that this is the greatest nation on Earth, and policies that help defend or protect freedom are the ones that are the right ones for us,"" Cheney said. ""And I'm going to be part of doing that ... and making sure that Donald Trump isn't our nominee in any way I can."" But for now, Cheney said she's focused on her reelection effort in Wyoming. It could prove a difficult cycle for the state's sole member of the House of Representatives. Cheney has branded herself an opponent of the former president in a state that voted overwhelmingly for him. Seventy percent of Wyoming's vote went to Trump in 2020. ABC's ""This Week"" Co-Anchor Martha Raddatz traveled to Wyoming, where she spoke to many of Cheney's constituents including Dennis Laughlin, a Harley-Davidson dealership owner in Green River, Wyoming, who said Cheney is falling in popularity. ""I think voting your conscience is noble. But not necessarily the best move that you can make for your political career,"" Laughlin said. ""The vast majority of people in the state of Wyoming are not happy with her decision."" Cheney knows her vote to impeach Trump is not popular with many of her constituents, but she said she's committed to making sure voters in her state understand her reasoning and where she believes the party can be headed with the right guidance. ""The people of Wyoming fundamentally believe in the Constitution and faithfulness to it and our oath,"" Cheney said. ""If the choice is between somebody that Donald Trump decides he's going to anoint and that person's basis for being in this race is their loyalty to some person, to Donald Trump, every day of the week I will stack my record and my commitment to the Constitution and my commitment to people of Wyoming up against that."" Cheney is confident in her political future. And if she does make a presidential bid, she told Karl she's got at least one high-profile politician backing her: her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney. Karl asked Cheney if her father would like to see her run. ""Well, yeah,"" Cheney said. ""He's my dad, he's not objective."""
abc|"Several states and a string of local leaders are holding off on changing their mask mandates following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's new guidance that allows fully vaccinated Americans to go without masks indoors or outdoors. A growing number of states -- including Connecticut, Illinois, Kentucky, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington state -- said they would change their rules to follow the agency's new guidance, hours after it was announced. However, Hawaii and Massachusetts announced that for now, they plan to keep their mask mandates in place. Over a dozen other states and jurisdictions have yet to announce their plans. Local leaders in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, California, and Washington, D.C., which are all led by Democrats, said Thursday they'd take the new CDC guidance under advisement before adopting. Whether states that choose to follow CDC guidelines will keep their mask mandates in place for unvaccinated individuals, remains unclear. ""If you are fully vaccinated, you can start doing the things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic,"" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at a White House briefing Thursday. The CDC said locals must continue to abide by existing state and local regulations and business rules.  The new guidance comes on the heels of the CDC""s approval of the COVID-19 vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds on Wednesday. Currently, 22 state governments, as well as Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, require people to wear face coverings in public settings. The pandemic saw local leaders impose restrictions upon their constituents, with many of the most stringent lockdowns ordered by Democratic leaders. On Friday, Minnesota and North Carolina ended their mask mandates. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper lifted all mandatory capacity, gathering limits and social distancing requirements while easing most mask requirements. The state will follow the new CDC guidance and masks will be required in child care, schools and camps as most children are not vaccinated or not eligible to be vaccinated yet. Michigan, Maryland and Virginia also joined the other states in lifting mask requirements for vaccinated locals. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Witnmer updated the state""s mask mandate following the CDC guidance, ahead of the state""s July 1 mask mandate expiration date. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan lifted the state""s indoor and outdoor mask mandate effective Saturday. ""Today is the day that so many of us have been waiting for and working toward,"" Hogan said. ""We finally do clearly see the light at the end of that tunnel. Our long, hard-fought battle against the worst global pandemic in more than a century is finally nearing an end."" In Maine, officials said they'd adopt the new CDC guidance effective May 24. At a city level, mayors in Washington, D.C., and New York City are reviewing the guidance before announcing any official changes. Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday the city will review the new rules ""as masks will still be important for schools, public transportation, doctors' offices and more."" Similarly, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said ""L.A. County and the state will review the recommendations in order to make sensible adjustments."" Gov. Gavin Newsom said this week the state would drop outdoor mask mandates on June 15, when the state intends to fully reopen. In Washington state, Gov. Jay Inslee didn""t wear a mask for his news conference Thursday saying the state was immediately adopting the new federal guidance on mask wearing. ""This is a really good reason to get vaccinated. That shot is a ticket to freedom from masks,"" Inslee said. States that haven""t announced a new guidance yet include California, New Jersey, New York, D.C. and Puerto Rico as of Saturday. The new recommendation, which carves out exceptions for buses, planes, trains, hospitals, prisons and homeless shelters, will have significant implications for schools and businesses as the country begins to reopen. Even on Capitol Hill, lawmakers must abide by the mask guidance until all House staffers are vaccinated, according to a memo by the office of the attending physician obtained by ABC News. Some critics wonder if the decision comes too hastily as variants still threaten the spread of COVID-19 and several regions of the country still grapple with vaccine hesitancy. So far, 35.8% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, or more than 118 million people. That number is projected to surge now that children are eligible for the vaccine."
abc|"The TAKE with Rick Klein One of the most consequential political weeks of the year has also been among the most confounding. We saw gas shortages tied to a pipeline hack , Middle East violence , inflation and recession worries, concerns about vaccine hesitancy -- and also extended vaccine authorizations and easing of mask mandates . The Republican Party hewed itself closer than ever to former President Donald Trump . Friday's now-contested vote for Rep. Liz Cheney's replacement in leadership is likely to extend Trump's hold on the party -- a hold bound by falsehoods . Yet while Trump may be as powerful as ever, so may be President Joe Biden . More quietly, yet no less significantly, Biden may be getting progress out of his meetings with both Democrats and Republicans on infrastructure. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., emerged from a White House meeting Thursday calling Biden an ""honest broker."" Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said after his meeting with Biden this week that there's a ""bipartisan pathway forward."" Not coincidentally, first lady Jill Biden spent a chunk of the day Thursday in ... West Virginia. Much has been made of whether Biden holds an outdated view of the Republican Party, and the president himself has confessed bewilderment over the disarray in GOP ranks . But it might be that he's found a way to deal with members of the party as they are, with meetings with individual members more impactful than meetings with leadership. It may yet be impossible for Democrats to cut deals with a party that is centering itself on a lie that denies Biden's legitimacy. Yet that question is far from settled -- an achievement in itself for the Biden agenda, when Trump's sway over the other party only grows. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Biden touted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's new guidance Thursday after the agency announced it was no longer recommending mask-wearing for the fully vaccinated. ""And for now, after a year of hard work and so much sacrifice, the rule is very simple. Get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do,"" said Biden in remarks from the Rose Garden . ""It is vaxed or mask."" A byproduct of the new guidance is the hope that the lure of mask-free living could encourage unvaccinated Americans to get the shot. It comes as waning demand for vaccines across the country has forced leaders to find creative ways to incentivize them. The latest example is Ohio Gov. Mike Dewine, who is using federal coronavirus relief funds to host lottery drawings , offering five people $1 million in exchange for getting the vaccine . Concerns about enforcement of mask-wearing for the unvaccinated remain. Biden told reporters Thursday masking would continue to be self-enforced. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky warned that those who aren't fully vaccinated and dared to go maskless would be at risk of contracting COVID-19 , not those who she called ""protected"" through vaccination. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Arizona's Gov. Doug Ducey became the latest of an expanding list of governors to opt out of distributing additional unemployment benefits to boost states' workforces. At least nine other Republican governors have made similar decisions over the course of the last few weeks. Complaints from business leaders about shortages of workers has triggered an economic debate over whether a broader examination of America's workforce is needed. ""In Arizona, we're going to use federal money to encourage people to work ... instead of paying people not to work,"" Ducey said in a video, while also specifically calling out the restaurant industry as a sector that is suffering from a lack of employees. Ducey's plan includes a ""one-time bonus of $2,000 to eligible individuals who return to the workforce and get a full-time job."" Those who return to work part-time will receive $1,000. Three months of childcare assistance and some educational support opportunities will also be included for those returning to the workforce. However, the financial bonuses are not immediate -- individuals will receive them after leaving the unemployment insurance program and having completed at least 10 weeks of work.

abc|"If you""re going to CVS or Target, bring your mask. But if you swing by Trader Joe""s or Starbucks, you can leave it in the car, assuming you are fully vaccinated of course. That said, if you""re taking public transportation to get there, you""ll need to mask up for the ride. After 405 days of urging every man, woman and child to wear a mask, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stunned much of the nation this week -- including health experts – with its recommendations that vaccinated Americans can mostly ditch the mask. The decision left businesses, governors and schools scrambling to respond and an emerging hodgepodge of rules for masks, depending upon which state, county or store a person is in. The new CDC proposal also raises serious questions: Can employers require proof of vaccination before a worker goes mask-free? Should businesses ask patrons to present proof upon entry? Could teens, eligible for the vaccine, be denied access to a classroom without a mask if they aren""t vaccinated? Governors said they weren""t briefed in advance on the plan, despite 24 states and the District of Columbia having some sort of state-wide mask mandate in place at the time of the announcement. ""We were as surprised as anyone by the CDC""s announcement – learning about it through the press,"" said Republican Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, calling CDC messaging in recent months ""inconsistent, convoluted, and ever changing."" In Maine, Gov. Janet Mills told reporters she was ""anxious"" to hear from the CDC how to distinguish between vaccinated the unvaccinated people. But by Friday, Mills announced she was on board and that the state would adopt the CDC guidance as state policy. Several health experts also said were caught off guard, assuming new mask recommendations would come when more Americans were fully vaccinated. Nearly 36% of the U.S. population is vaccinated, and the pace of shots has declined. ""I thought it would be prudent to wait until everyone who is willing (ages 12 and up) has had an opportunity to be fully vaccinated, around July 1,"" said Linsey Marr, a virus transmission expert at Virginia Tech. Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University's Milken School of Public Health, tweeted: ""I""m still stunned at the CDC decision."" The White House, too, claimed to be unaware of precisely what the new recommendation would be, making the case that the CDC came to its conclusion without political pressure. Press secretary Jen Psaki said only a ""small number"" of people at the White House knew about the proposal Wednesday night. ""The White House was informed of that decision, just to give people assurance of that,"" Psaski told reporters Friday. When asked what the CDC guidance means for Biden""s executive order that mandates masks be worn on federal property, Psaki said it may take a few days for any possible changes, but she expects ""the guidelines will be the guide."" ""We're working to implement those guidelines across the government,"" she said. Several big-chain stores also seemed surprised, firing off terse statements that mask mandates would remain in place until they had a chance to review the new recommendations and determine which businesses might be subject to local mandates. ""These conflicting positions put retailers and their employees in incredibly difficult situations,"" said Lisa LaBruno, a senior executive vice president at the Retail Industry Leaders Association. For its part, the CDC defended the new guidance as a natural next step based on emerging scientific evidence, including fresh studies that the vaccines were holding up against variants of the virus and cutting asymptomatic transmission. The CDC also cited plummeting case numbers and a recent decision by regulators that kids as young as 12 now qualify for vaccination. ""We have had a coalescence of more science that has emerged just in the last week,"" Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, told reporters when asked what had changed in the past 16 days since the agency last released mask guidance. Under the new recommendations, people who are fully immunized should feel safe removing their masks in almost all circumstances, even indoors and in a crowd. The guidelines call for masks to still be worn on planes, trains and buses, as well as homeless shelters, hospitals and prisons. While the CDC insisted its decision was grounded in science, it seemed to acknowledge that it was unprepared to answer the questions that would come with it. In an interview with NPR""s ""All Things Considered,"" Walensky said the recommendation would trigger a review of other guidance. ""What we really need to do now as an agency is comb all of our guidance not just for travel, but for schools and for camps and for child care centers and for all of the guidance that we have out there …  And that is going to be the work of the weeks ahead that we have in the agency,"" Walensky told NPR on Thursday. John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor, said one primary concern is that the U.S. is still experiencing active disease transmission with more than 35,000 COVID cases a day. Also, some vulnerable populations including children don't have the option of getting vaccinated. That puts everyone on the honor system and many people and businesses confused on how exactly to stay safe, he said. ""Americans are feeling incredible whiplash,"" Brownstein said. ABC News"" producers Sasha Pezenik, Ben Gittleson and Justin Gomez contributed to this report."
abc|"President Joe Biden on Thursday celebrated the federal government""s new guidance on mask-wearing as ""a great milestone."" ""I think it""s a great milestone, a great day,"" Biden said during remarks after walking out into the White House Rose Garden not wearing a mask. ""It""s been made possible by the extraordinary success we""ve had in vaccinating so many Americans so quickly."" Biden spoke shortly after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new guidance saying fully vaccinated people no longer needed to wear a mask indoors or outdoors. ""If you""re fully vaccinated and can take your mask off, you have earned the right to do something that Americans are known for all around the world: greeting others with a smile. With a smile. So, it is a good day for the country."" Americans who have already been vaccinated ""stepped up"" and ""did what I consider to be your patriotic duty,"" Biden said. ""The simple truth is this: the American people have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down."" The president recognized all of the first responders who have been on the front lines in the pandemic for over a year now. He thanked doctors, nurses, the U.S. military, researchers and drug companies, but he also expressed appreciation directly to the American people. ""For more than a year, you have endured so much and so many lost jobs, so many businesses lost, so many lives upended and so many months that our kids couldn't be in school. You couldn""t see your friends or family. All the moments that mattered so much from birthdays to weddings to graduations, all postponed. And most tragically of all, the lost lives,"" he said. Vice President Kamala Harris stood beside him, also without a face covering. The CDC announcement came as they were meeting with Republican senators in the Oval Office, and according to one senator in the meeting, the president and senators  took off their masks midway through the meeting. The agency had faced questions in recent days about whether it was moving too slowly to issue guidance permitting fully-vaccinated people to forgo masks in more instances, especially as more evidence showed how effective COVID-19 vaccines were at protecting people from becoming infected or seriously ill. The CDC had previously said it was OK for fully vaccinated people to allow face coverings outdoors, unless they were in large gatherings. The White House has repeatedly said it would follow the advice of government scientists. Biden reiterated CDC guidance Thursday that said unvaccinated people should still wear a face covering in many situations. He also asked Americans to be respectful of others if they see someone still wearing a mask because they want to feel more protected. ""You know, some may say, I just feel more comfortable continuing to wear a mask. They may feel that way. So if you""re someone with a mask, you see them, please treat them with kindness and respect. We've had too much conflict, too much bitterness, too much anger, too much politicization of this issue about wearing masks. Let's put it to rest."""
abc|"Republican lawmakers left a meeting with President Joe Biden Thursday optimistic that an agreement can be reached on an infrastructure package , but lawmakers must act quickly if they hope to strike a deal before the president's fast-approaching deadline. While Biden has long projected a desire to work across the aisle on an infrastructure plan, he's also been clear that Democrats will forge ahead without Republicans if bipartisan talks don't yield swift results. The White House wants to see "" significant progress "" on an infrastructure deal by Memorial Day and Biden is aiming for final passage by the end of the summer. Republicans leaving the White House Thursday indicated that agreement was possible. Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, who is leading the Republican infrastructure effort, painted Biden as an ""honest broker"" and said that during Thursday's meeting, the parties laid out next steps for trying to bridge the substantive divide between their two infrastructure plans. ""He was very open to suggestions as were we. I think it's the beginning of -- a good jump-start I think,"" Capito said on Fox News. ""We promised to come back with another offer that he will react to and counter offer. We did what we intended to do, which is get next steps, be very cordial and ready to deal."" The Republican counter-offer, which is expected to be a more detailed version of the framework they presented to Biden Thursday, could come as soon as early next week, said Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, who also attended the meeting. Biden is then expected to counter that offer. ""We all know we need to move pretty quickly here,"" Blunt said. There's limited opportunity to make legislative headway in the summer months because the Senate leaves town for Memorial Day, Independence Day and the August recess. The highway system and surface transportation systems law expires in September, compounding the need for lawmakers to act swiftly. The central sticking point left to be resolved is how broadly infrastructure ought to be defined. Biden has proposed two infrastructure plans totaling about $4 trillion dollars that fund everything from roads and bridges to a boost in the power grid, electric-vehicle charging stations, in-home care and public buildings, such as schools. The administration branded some items in the package, like child care and home care as ""human infrastructure."" Republicans scoffed at that and offered a counter proposal, led by Capito, that focuses on ""core"" infrastructure. Their original framework would fund roads, bridges, ports, waterways, airports and broadband at about $568 billion dollars. Despite the substantive divide, following their meeting Thursday, Capito said Biden seemed to understand the narrower Republican approach. ""I'm not saying he agrees with it or with everything, that's the point of a negotiation here,"" Capito said. ""He understands why we knocked some things out. If he wants to try to have us reconsider -- that's part of a negotiation. I think he got our point. He understands what we think modern infrastructure is."" To reach an agreement with Republicans, the White House is signaling it is willing to split its package and allow funding for traditional infrastructure to pass with some GOP backing. It will then pursue use of a procedural tool called reconciliation to pass the more controversial aspects of the Democratic plan. Biden used reconciliation, which allows the Senate to bypass the usual 60-vote threshold to pass the $2 trillion COVID-19 relief bill down partisan lines in March -- a move that left some Republicans with a bitter taste after they said the president failed to negotiate with them in good faith. Some were skeptical that infrastructure discussions would play out differently, but Capito signaled Thursday that if Biden chooses to use reconciliation to pass the more controversial aspects of his plan, it won't prevent Republicans from negotiating on a separate, more narrowly tailored traditional infrastructure bill. Even if Biden musters a bipartisan success on ""core infrastructure"" it's not clear he'd have the support of all 50 Democrats needed to pass the ""human infrastructure"" aspects. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., has said he supports a smaller, more narrowly tailored package, not unlike the one that Republicans are proposing. And he's said he'd like to try to find a middle ground between Capito's $568 billion plan and Biden's much larger proposal. Price is not necessarily a sticking point for Republicans, there's wiggle room so long as the bill is tailored to traditional infrastructure. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell signaled earlier this week that the price tag could be as high as $800 billion. ""I made it clear that this was not a stagnant offer from us,"" Capito said after suggesting she was potentially open to raising the price of the bill. ""I didn't want it to be perceived that way at all and I think that was clear. He made it clear that he's sincere in wanting to pursue this and in the end we agreed if it doesn't work, we'll walk away friends."" But while Republicans find cost negotiable, there are rigid lines on how to fund the bill. Biden proposed funding his robust infrastructure plan by hiking the corporate tax rate, a non-starter for Republicans who see this as a referendum on the 2017 Trump tax bill, which some consider the most significant legislative achievement of the former president's tenure. ""We're not interested in re-opening the 2017 tax bill. We both made that clear to the president,"" McConnell said following a meeting at the White House between Biden and the four Congressional leaders. ""That is a red line."" During their meeting Thursday Republicans tried to convince Biden that there are better ways to fund the package. They've proposed repurposing previously allocated unused money from the COVID-19 relief bills, as well as private-public partnerships and user fees, like tolls. It's not yet clear whether Biden is receptive to these funding models, but Republican optimism is clear. ""I think we moved the ball forward today,"" Capito said. ABC News' Trish Turner contributed to this report."
abc|"Hoping to ease concerns of millions of Americans experiencing gasoline shortages and rising prices following the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline , President Joe Biden gave an update on the situation Thursday, looking to deal with a potentially damaging political problem and on the heels of his new executive order aimed to prevent future attacks. He pleaded with Americans to be patient as the pipeline company returns to full operations. ""I want to be clear -- we will not feel the effects at the pump immediately,"" Biden said in remarks from the White House and carried on national television. ""This is not like flicking on a light switch. This pipeline is 5,500 miles long."" Biden said that he expects to see a ""region-by-region return to normalcy"" starting this weekend and into next week, but told Americans not to be alarmed or hoard gasoline. ""Don't panic,"" he said. ""I know seeing lines at the pumps or gas stations with no gas can be extremely stressful. But this is a temporary situation. Do not get more gas than you need in the next few days … Panic buying will only slow the process."" Looking directly into the camera and leaning into the microphone, Biden warned gas stations against price-gouging, saying, ""do not try to take advantage of consumers during this time."" ""I'm going to work with governors in the affected states to put a stop to price gouging wherever it arises. And I'm asking our federal agencies to stand ready to provide assistance to state level efforts to monitor and address any price gouging at the pump. Nobody should be using this situation for financial gain."" Colonial Pipeline restarted its system late Wednesday afternoon and in a statement Thursday morning said it's ""made substantial progress"" and that ""product delivery has commenced in a majority"" of markets they service in the southeast. In South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington, D.C., gas stations with fuel outages are over 50%, according to GasBuddy . The president has been briefed on the incident every day since the attack happened Friday night by his counselor Steve Ricchetti and National Security Council chief of staff Yohannes Abraham, a source familiar with the matter told ABC News and first reported by Axios. Biden was also briefed by White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan twice on Sunday and again on Monday and Tuesday. In sign of the political sensitivities involved, the sources made a point of noting it was clear from Biden's first briefing that he wanted to be regularly updated on the latest developments and, in particular, what was being done to respond. The president Thursday reiterated that there was no evidence that the Russian government was behind the attack, but that those involved ""are living in Russia ."" He told ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Mary Bruce that he believes the FBI's assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin was not involved and that the United States would not be carrying out any kind of retaliatory cyberattacks to shut down the criminals involved. ""We have been in direct communications with Moscow about the imperative for responsible countries to take decisive action against these ransomware networks. We're also going to pursue a measure to disrupt their ability to operate."" There are few things more politically dangerous than high gas prices, and with the Memorial Day holiday around the corner, the president looked to tamper worries with his remarks and spoke directly to frustrated Americans, making the case that this issue will be short-lived. His remarks came just hours after he signed an executive order to strengthen U.S. cybersecurity defenses with the goal of preventing similar attacks and after the White House has faced questions about why it wasn""t better prepared to protect its infrastructure. Biden""s order mandates companies ""doing business with the federal government"" share information with it about hacks, but would have no implications for private companies that aren""t.The president acknowledged the restraints in his executive power, admitting ""I cannot dictate that the private companies do certain things relative to cybersecurity."" On Wednesday, a senior administration official said they ""pushed the authority as far as we could,"" in relation to the executive order and that ""anybody doing business with the U.S. government will have to share incidents, so that we can use that information to protect Americans more broadly."" It will also require all software bought by the federal government to meet certain security standards within nine months and ""creates a pilot program to create an 'Energy Star' type of label so the government – and the public at large – can quickly determine whether software was developed securely."" Another danger the Biden administration is now confronted with are concerns over inflation and rising prices on consumer goods, including gas prices which crossed $3 a gallon on Wednesday for first time in 7 years. Prices consumers pay for goods like food and gas went up 0.8 percent in April according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . Over the last 12 months, the ""all items index"" increased 4.2%., which is the largest 12-month increase since September 2008. Prices for used cars and trucks rose 10% in April as well, making it the largest 1-month increase since the series began in 1953, and were a significant contributor to the broader increase. All three major stock indices fell Wednesday as data indicated inflation was higher than expected in the month of April and investors seem to be nervous that it may be higher and more persistent than the Federal Reserve and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have been forecasting. White House press secretary Jen Psaki this week said that the administration takes ""the possibility of inflation quite seriously"" but that there are ""a range of factors"" in play. ""There""s a couple of data points that are specific to this moment.  And we knew, just as the — as the economy, sort of, shrunk and shut down, that, as it""s turning back on, there would be some of these impacts.""

abc|"Nearly a week into what has been getting close to all-out war between Israeli forces and Hamas, the terror group that governs Gaza, President Joe Biden is facing sharp criticism from Republicans and some Democrats at home for his response. His administration has tried to show high-level involvement after criticism that Biden wasn't engaged on the issue, but his vocal support for Israel's government has now sparked condemnation from progressive lawmakers, even as it fails to ward off former Trump officials' criticisms, too. ""My expectation and hope is that this will be closing down sooner than later,"" Biden told reporters earlier this week, adding the next day that he'd seen no ""overreaction"" in Israel's response so far and that he backs Israel's ""right to self-defense."" Despite his administration's calls for ""de-escalation,"" those comments appear to have been taken by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a green light for further military action. After Biden and Netanyahu spoke Wednesday, Hamas rocket fire and Israeli airstrikes continued Thursday, and on Friday, Israeli ground troops deployed along the border, firing into the blockaded Palestinian territory from the Israeli side of the border while aircraft continued to strike targets. In five days of bloodshed, 122 people, including 31 children, have been killed in the Gaza Strip, and least 900 others have been injured, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Seven people, including a 6-year-old, have been killed in Israel by rocket fire, with more than 523 others wounded, according to the Israel Defense Forces. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Hady Amr arrived in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Friday for meetings with senior Israeli and Palestinian officials in Israel and the West Bank, according to State Department deputy spokesperson Jalina Porter. Amr's trip comes after phone calls from Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Netanyahu, as well as Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has also spoken to his Israeli and Egyptian counterparts. But the Biden administration has been criticized as flat-footed here, a charge they reject, because the White House has yet to nominate a U.S. ambassador to Israel or restore the U.S. consul general in East Jerusalem, a de facto envoy to the Palestinians. Unlike the Obama or Trump administrations, there is also no special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian issues. Amr, who served as President Obama's deputy special envoy, is the highest ranking official for the issue. The Biden administration ""didn't stumble blindly into ignoring the conflict. It was an affirmative decision, perhaps a calculated risk,"" said Lucy Kurtzer-Ellenbogen, director of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict program at the U.S. Institute of Peace, noting the ""little political and foreign policy benefit to gain by investing significant capital"" in addressing the decades-old conflict. But while the U.S. didn't light the ""fire,"" she added, ""the U.S. by its actions can either be in the realm of ignoring, fueling -- and I think sometimes ignoring is fueling -- or fire-fighting, as it's having to do right now. If we don't want to find ourselves in that constant pendulum swing from fire-fighting to ignoring, I think we need to be in the business of active fire-proofing and that is going to be the question for the administration as it moves forward,"" she said. To critics on the left, Biden has been setting his firehose on the wrong side, defending Israel's response and declining to call Palestinian leadership. ""This is not about both sides. This is about an imbalance of power,"" said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on the House floor Thursday. ""The president and many other figures this week stated that Israel has a right to self defense ... But do Palestinians have a right to survive?"" In a letter this week, Ocasio-Cortez was one of over two dozen progressive lawmakers who urged the Biden administration to exert pressure on Israel to halt the potential evictions of Palestinians from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah, an East Jerusalem neighborhood where they face pressure from Israeli settlers -- and to review U.S. assistance to the Israeli government. The issue of evictions is pending before the Israeli Supreme Court, but has prompted protests from Palestinians in recent weeks -- along with the use of force against Palestinians at Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third-holiest site located in Jerusalem's Old City. Israeli forces stormed the building last week, saying Palestinians were stockpiling rocks and Molotov cocktails and sparking clashes that left hundreds injured. While that violence precipitated this latest round of bloodshed, several Republican officials, have accused Biden of not standing strongly enough with Israel. They say his delay in calling Netanyahu after being sworn in or his resumption of U.S. financial assistance to the Palestinians helped spark the violence. ""A weak foreign policy emboldens terrorists and makes the world less safe. America's leaders must be clear: we stand unequivocally with our ally and friend, Israel,"" Mike Pompeo, Trump's Secretary of State and a likely 2024 presidential contender, tweeted Friday."
ny_post|"Joe Biden wants to take one of the great American success stories of the last several decades — and drive it into the ground. He would turn his back on the stupendous wealth represented by proven reserves of oil and gas in this country. Rather than focusing on producing cheap, abundant energy — a key ingredient to human progress through all of human history — he would embark on the fool""s errand of trying to adjust the world""s thermostat 80 years from now. After a 50-year effort to diminish our reliance on Middle Eastern oil, which has miraculously happened at last, Biden would force America to transition to solar and wind, ­industries currently dependent on Chinese supply chains. Whereas California has embraced the radical goal of a carbon-free electric grid by 2045, and has drastically increased the price of energy in the state already, Biden has seen and raised the Golden State""s gambit by embracing a goal of 2035. All this was underlined by Biden""s statement at the end of last week""s debate that he wants to transition from oil , which constituted a gaffe only for anyone who hadn""t been paying attention to his Green New Deal-inflected energy plan. It""s a funny time to want to kneecap oil and gas. Proven reserves of natural gas in the United States are higher than ever before, thanks to American-made technological innovations. A couple of years ago, the United States surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia in crude-oil production. In recent years, petroleum and natural-gas exports have been increasing. And, of course, the rise of natural gas has cut US carbon emissions. This should be considered a ­national strength to be built on, not a national shame to be put on a glide path to extinction. Fossil fuels are tremendously useful source of energy, and no hype about renewables can obscure that reality. In 2019, petroleum, natural gas and coal accounted for 80 percent of overall energy consumption in the United States, according to US Energy Information Administration. Renewables made up only 11 percent, and the bulk of that came from biomass (wood and biofuels) and hydroelectric. Despite being heavily subsidized, wind and solar combined were responsible for only about a third of our renewable energy. As the Danish economist Bjorn Lomberg points out, the share of US energy that comes from renewables declined over the last century. The rise of fossil fuels were a boon to humanity, a major advance over those old renewables, wood and dung. ""Over a century and a half,"" Lomberg writes, ""we shed our reliance on renewable energy and powered the Industrial Revolution with fossil fuels."" The oil and gas industry should also be prized as a source of good American jobs. Petroleum engineers make about $137,000 a year, pump system and refinery operators, $72,000 a year, wellhead pumpers, $58,000, and roustabouts $44,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The idea that we are going to transition to wind and solar painlessly is a fantasy. Germany has been spending tens of billions a year trying to make this happen. Its renewable-energy program has doubled the cost of energy, while fossil fuels still account for about 80 percent of its energy supply. If we think eschewing fossil fuels is going to convince other countries to do the same, we are fooling ourselves. Like in the United States, the industrial takeoff in China coincided with a jump in the use of coal. China is still building coal plants at a furious clip. The Middle Kingdom has plans to add more than the current US coal-fired capacity on top of its already prodigious use of coal, which accounts for more than half of the world""s total. The Biden plan is an assault on American ingenuity and wealth, not to mention common sense. At least after last week, no one can say he wasn""t warned. Twitter: @RichLowry"

Now comes another presidential dilemma: What to make of the new and radical Joe Biden? On the surface, it seems an odd question about a 78-year-old man who has spent nearly 50 years in Washington. But the new Biden, the President Biden, doesn""t sound and act like the former senator and vice president. In fact, this Biden is so dramatically different that it""s not clear if we should take him either seriously or literally. Who the hell is this guy? The old Biden was a windbag who wouldn""t shut up, the new Biden is a silent Sam, especially when it comes to answering press questions. He ducks, dodges, hides and mumbles. The old Biden was proud about his friendship with Southern segregationists and called Sen. Robert Byrd , a former member of the KKK, a mentor. The new Biden declares all America guilty of ""systemic racism"" and says it""s ""a stain on the nation""s soul."" The old Biden defended the Senate filibuster and opposed packing the Supreme Court . The new Biden calls the filibuster a relic of Jim Crow and forms a commission to study court changes. The old Biden pushed back against the Green New Deal during the campaign, but the new Biden wants to upend industries and alter daily life by imposing draconian cuts on fossil fuels. The old Biden claimed credit for writing the 1994 crime bill, which funded 100,000 local police officers and 125,000 new prison cells and toughened mandatory penalties. The new Biden marked the guilty verdict against former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin for killing George Floyd by saying the case ""ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see the systemic racism. The knee on the neck of justice for black Americans."" People change, and it""s good that they do. To stay rigidly fixed in outlook for a decade, let alone 50 years, could suggest a closed mind rather than a principled one. But the new Biden is not the result of evolution. Rather, his radical views on race, government institutions, climate change and criminal justice represent such sudden, wholesale reversals that they invite skepticism about his sincerity and whether he is fully in charge of his faculties. Does he really believe these things, or are they convenient lurches as he tries to keep up with the ""woke"" wingnuts who dominate his party in Washington? Does he recognize the implications of his sweeping condemnations of law enforcement and white Americans? One revealing moment came last week when a Post reporter, Steven Nelson, asked the White House this question : ""To what extent does President Biden acknowledge his own role in systemic racism?"" It""s a fair question because Biden has been a pivotal player in a system he now denounces. Does he regret his own conduct as it relates to race? Does he believe he, his children and grandchildren benefited from the systemic racism he sees everywhere? A thoughtful, honest answer might have been revealing about events or experiences that changed the president""s views. Instead, press secretary Jen Psaki responded with a nonresponse, saying in part, ""One of the president""s core objectives is addressing racial injustice in this country."" The same question could be asked of other long-serving, powerful Dems who regularly echo the race-baiting claims. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been in Congress since 1987. What has she done to stop systemic racism, and has she benefited from it? Was her father, also a politician, a racist? Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has been in public office since 1975, starting with the New York state Assembly. When did he discover America is riddled with systemic racism, and what did he do about it? Few politicians practice the diversity they preach. A 2015 study found that African Americans accounted for less than 1 percent of top staffers in the Senate. When former Alabama Sen. Doug Jones appointed a black chief of staff in 2018, he was the only Democrat to have one. And neither Anita Hill nor Clarence Thomas thought Biden was worried about systemic racism during Thomas"" 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearing. Go to YouTube and watch Thomas shred Biden""s stewardship of the hearings by calling them a ""high-tech lynching.""  The same pattern holds on other ideas Biden is pushing. He talked for years about helping ""lunch pail"" workers, but his first action as president was killing 11,000 good-paying jobs by blocking the Keystone XL pipeline . While Biden""s entire big-ticket, big-cost agenda is roiling the nation, his approach on race is explosive and polarizing. Already his Department of Education is proposing grants to incentivize schools to teach critical race theory and push The New York Times""s error-ridden 1619 Project . Purveyors of this propaganda aim to destroy pride in American history and cast every aspect of modern life as evidence of white supremacy. You can bet a push for reparations is coming. It is one thing for crackpot academics and racialized newspapers to indoctrinate students with anti-American trash. It is scandalously awful when the president of the United States joins the amen chorus. Race relations declined under the Obama-Biden administration and are now in free fall. Unfortunately, the damage is not limited to academic debate. The national surge of criminal violence is a direct result of politicians handcuffing cops and preventing them from making arrests because of the ideology and/or race of perpetrators. With nonwhite Americans making up the vast bulk of both crime victims and suspects, restricting cops will mean more victims among the very people Biden says he wants to help. Of course, he also says he wants to unite the country. How""s that going? It was Scams Are Us week in the City Council. Brooklyn Democrat Chaim Deutsch pleaded guilty to tax fraud after concealing income from his real-estate company. The feds say he evaded paying $82,076 in property taxes. Another Brooklyn Dem, Brad Lander, confessed he was caught speeding in school zones eight times. The Post reports he amassed 118 vehicle and traffic violations since 2013. All while pushing for crackdowns on reckless drivers. Finally, the council""s former police watchdog, Bronx Dem Vanessa Gibson, got hit with a $5,000 fine for convincing a precinct commander to let her dodge a ticket. Gibson admitted she used her position to benefit herself. Headline: Harley-Davidson unleashes silent e-hogs . That""s odd. Isn""t the annoying noise the point of motorcycles?"

cbs|"Brownsville, Texas — After a months-long trek across four countries, Dayana and Lazaro, two political dissidents from Cuba, reached the U.S. southern border in 2019 hoping to apply for asylum. But the spouses met starkly different fates. Dayana, who was pregnant at the time, was allowed to enter and stay in the U.S. on humanitarian grounds. Lazaro, however, was sent back to Mexico and instructed to wait there indefinitely for his U.S. asylum court hearings. Lazaro said he was not given an explanation for being turned back to Mexico. ""It was difficult for me, because it was a forced separation,"" he told CBS News in Spanish. ""They didn't let us say goodbye,"" Dayana said. The Trump administration required Lazaro and 70,000 other asylum-seekers from Latin America to wait in Mexico while their cases were adjudicated. It argued the policy, known as Remain in Mexico , was needed to reduce unauthorized migration and discourage economic migrants from using the asylum process to enter the U.S. Individuals and families with children were sent to some of the most dangerous and crime-ridden areas of Mexico. Hundreds were kidnapped, extorted, assaulted and even murdered, according to human rights groups . A sprawling and squalid migrant tent camp sprung up in the Mexican city of Matamoros and became a symbol of the Trump administration's hard-line asylum policies. Lazaro and Dayana said their separation took a heavy emotional toll. Dayana said she worried about losing her baby because of the adverse emotional impact of the separation. ""It was very difficult,"" Dayana said. ""I was very unwell for days. In fact, I was unwell for months. I had depression during the pregnancy. And I had postpartum depression as well."" Lazaro was stranded in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, for a year and seven months and missed the birth of his daughter, Ashley, who was born in the Dallas area last July. He said he hit an emotional low point during the coronavirus pandemic, when the court hearings for his asylum case — the gateway to reuniting with Dayana and meeting Ashley — were postponed indefinitely. ""It was a very big blow,"" Lazaro recounted. ""I had that expectation of meeting the baby and being with my wife and suddenly all of it fell apart."" Disillusioned, the family placed their hopes on Joe Biden, who campaigned on ending Trump administration border policies he derided as inhumane and draconian. Mr. Biden vowed to scrap the Remain in Mexico program, which he said had forced asylum-seekers to live ""in squalor."" ""I didn't sleep on Election Day,"" Lazaro said. On the day of Mr. Biden's inauguration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) suspended the Remain in Mexico policy. In February, the Biden administration said it would allow some of those returned to Mexico to continue their asylum proceedings in the U.S. as long as they had pending cases. Working with Mexico, the United Nations and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Biden administration established a process to admit these asylum-seekers at selected ports of entry. The U.N. set up a website for eligible asylum applicants to register for an appointment to enter the U.S., while IOM stood up COVID-19 testing sites. Late last month, CBS News was granted exclusive access to the Brownsville port of entry, one of six official border crossings that has been processing asylum petitioners with pending cases. More than 20 asylum-seekers arrived at the Brownsville port of entry that day through the Gateway International Bridge after testing negative for COVID-19 in Mexico. The group of asylum-seekers, which included families with children, was greeted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials. Their belongings were checked for contraband, and they were then taken inside a tent facility, where government personnel checked their case information and collected biometric data. All asylum-seekers wore face shields and masks. Barring a few cases delayed by computer glitches, the asylum applicants were processed in a matter of minutes. ""These are people that we already knew who they were,"" said Aaron Bowker, director of communications for the Office of Field Operations, the CBP branch that oversees ports of entry. ""We were able to leverage that technology and, with the help of those NGOs and those international organizations in Mexico, to get the information sent to us in advance so that when they were metered to arrive at the port of entry, it could be as smooth a process as possible."" Once the processing was completed, the group was escorted outside the port of entry and officially released from U.S. custody. A bus came to pick them up so they could begin their journey to their respective destinations, often the homes of family and friends, where they have been allowed to live while their cases are adjudicated by U.S. courts. ""We're very happy and thankful,"" a mother from Honduras told CBS News as she prepared to board the bus with her young daughter. According to DHS figures, more than 10,000 asylum-seekers have been admitted into the U.S. through this new process, including Lazaro, who was allowed to enter the country in March. Asked how he felt when he reunited with Dayana and met Ashley, Lazaro called the moment ""indescribable."" ""It was a very strong feeling,"" Dayana interjected. ""I spent two days with headaches. I would look at him every day and tell him that I couldn't believe that he was here."" ""When I saw the baby and held her — I still can't believe it,"" Lazaro added. The Biden administration has touted its drawdown of the Remain in Mexico policy as a model for the future of asylum processing at the U.S.-Mexico border, highlighting the COVID-19 testing and digital registration process. The program is a safe and orderly alternative to crossing the border illegally to request U.S. refuge, officials have said. ""Under the leadership of President Biden, we have put in place a safe and humane system to process individuals with active MPP cases as the first phase of a program to restore orderly processing at the Southwest Border,"" DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement to CBS News. ""We are moving quickly to rebuild our immigration system and undo the cruelty and chaos of the prior administration so our country again shows the world we are a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants."" So far, however, the Biden administration has kept ports of entry closed to most asylum-seekers without pending cases through ""non-essential travel"" pandemic-era restrictions. It has also continued to use the public health authority known as Title 42 invoked under former President Donald Trump to expel most migrant adults and some families to Mexico without allowing them to apply for U.S. asylum. While there has been some small-scale processing of vulnerable asylum petitioners at ports of entry in recent weeks, Biden administration officials have not said when and if large-scale processing will start, frustrating some advocates and human rights groups. ""If the administration is talking about essentially using this system for new asylum seekers, all that means is once again just having metering again,"" said Taylor Levy, an immigration attorney who helped Lazaro and Dayana, referring to the pre-pandemic U.S. practice of placing migrants on waitlists to request protection at a port of entry. ""That cannot be the only system that exists for people to be able to exercise their legal rights. It is legal to seek asylum. It is enshrined in our laws,"" Levy continued. Meanwhile, Lazaro and Dayana are looking forward to starting a new life with their daughter in the U.S. Like other asylum-seekers admitted into the U.S., they still have to continue their immigration proceedings to pursue asylum or other forms of permanent legal status. ""We hope to push forward in this country. To work and raise the baby,"" Lazaro said. ""May she grow up loving her country, loving her homeland. She is one more American that we have here."""
cbs|"President Biden visited Lake Charles, Louisiana, on Thursday as part of his nationwide tour to promote his sweeping $2.3 trillion proposal the American Jobs Plan. Mr. Biden's visit to the deep-red state of Louisiana was the latest stop on his ""Getting America Back on Track"" tour, as he tries to persuade not just Republican lawmakers but everyday Americans that his ideas are worth the massive price tag. Louisiana hasn't voted for a Democrat for president since Bill Clinton in 1996. The president first spoke with the 70-year-old Calcasieu River Bridge in the background in Lake Charles. ""When it comes to bridges and roads and the like, I've never seen a Republican or Democrat road. I just see roads,"" Mr. Biden said. The president used the Calcasieu River Bridge as an example of infrastructure that's fallen behind the times. The bridge was created to handle 37,000 crossings a day. It now handles more than 80,000 each day. ""You know when the bridge was built in 1952 there was nothing there. It was built to make sure that we in fact it was going to last for 50 years. That was 20 years ago,"" he said. The U.S. used to be first in the world in infrastructure, but now ranks eighth, Mr. Biden said, claiming infrastructure deficiencies cost the U.S. $160 billion a year in economic benefits. But the president cited benefits other than economic ones, too, insisting that his plan will increase the safety of travel, and make commutes shorter so workers can spend more time with their families. The president said large corporations and the very wealthy have to pay more into the country. ""Trickle down ain't working very well, man,"" he said, referencing the conservative economic theory that if businesses and the wealthy pay less in taxes, it will stimulate the economy and benefit those lower on the economic totem pole. Mr. Biden also spent time in Lake Charles on Thursday pitching the benefits of his American Families Plan, a $1.8 trillion proposal that would entail free preschool for all 3-and-4-year-olds, and two years of free community college, among other things. Lake Charles was hit by two hurricanes, Laura and Delta, in 2020, which broke the record for the most named storms. Ahead of Mr. Biden's visit, Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon sent the president a letter urging him to support additional disaster relief funding to help areas struggling to recover from natural disasters that took place in 2020 and early 2021. Mr. Biden has hit the road in recent weeks to drum up support from voters for his $2.3 trillion infrastructure package , which includes $621 billion to rebuild the nation's roads, bridges, rails and airports. A White House fact sheet examining the need for infrastructure improvements in Louisiana estimates there are 1,634 bridges and more than 3,400 miles of highway in the state that are in ""poor condition."" The president plans to pay for his infrastructure plan in part by raising the corporate tax rate to 28% and increasing the global minimum tax on U.S. multinational corporations. But Republicans have balked at the cost of Mr. Biden's plan and his proposed method of paying for it, as well as some components that GOP lawmakers say stretches the definition of ""infrastructure."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has frequently criticized the proposal, and told reporters on Wednesday that ""100% of my focus is on stopping this new administration."" He partially walked this comment back on Thursday, saying he is ""anxious to stop the Biden agenda depending on what it is."" ""I want to do business with the president, but he needs to be a moderate. He said he was going to be a moderate during the campaign. I haven't seen that yet,"" McConnell told reporters. A group of Republican senators last month put forth their own infrastructure counter-proposal , which at $568 billion is far smaller than Mr. Biden's plan. It's unclear exactly how much the president is willing to compromise, although he's expressed a willingness to compromise on the corporate tax increase. Mr. Biden's proposal calls for a 28% corporate tax rate, but Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a key vote, has pushed for nothing higher than a 25% corporate tax rate. Mr. Biden said during his remarks on Thursday that he was ""willing to hear ideas from both sides"" to improve the legislation, adding that he was meeting with congressional Republicans to see ""how much they're willing to go for."" ""I'm ready to compromise. What I'm not ready to do — I'm not ready to do nothing,"" Mr. Biden said. ""I'm not ready to have another period where American has another 'infrastructure month' that doesn't change a damn thing."" Mr. Biden also spoke with Louisiana Senators Bill Cassidy and John Kennedy, both Republicans, during his trip. Grace Segers contributed to this report."

cbs|"Brownsville, Texas — After a months-long trek across four countries, Dayana and Lazaro, two political dissidents from Cuba, reached the U.S. southern border in 2019 hoping to apply for asylum. But the spouses met starkly different fates. Dayana, who was pregnant at the time, was allowed to enter and stay in the U.S. on humanitarian grounds. Lazaro, however, was sent back to Mexico and instructed to wait there indefinitely for his U.S. asylum court hearings. Lazaro said he was not given an explanation for being turned back to Mexico. ""It was difficult for me, because it was a forced separation,"" he told CBS News in Spanish. ""They didn't let us say goodbye,"" Dayana said. The Trump administration required Lazaro and 70,000 other asylum-seekers from Latin America to wait in Mexico while their cases were adjudicated. It argued the policy, known as Remain in Mexico , was needed to reduce unauthorized migration and discourage economic migrants from using the asylum process to enter the U.S. Individuals and families with children were sent to some of the most dangerous and crime-ridden areas of Mexico. Hundreds were kidnapped, extorted, assaulted and even murdered, according to human rights groups . A sprawling and squalid migrant tent camp sprung up in the Mexican city of Matamoros and became a symbol of the Trump administration's hard-line asylum policies. Lazaro and Dayana said their separation took a heavy emotional toll. Dayana said she worried about losing her baby because of the adverse emotional impact of the separation. ""It was very difficult,"" Dayana said. ""I was very unwell for days. In fact, I was unwell for months. I had depression during the pregnancy. And I had postpartum depression as well."" Lazaro was stranded in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, for a year and seven months and missed the birth of his daughter, Ashley, who was born in the Dallas area last July. He said he hit an emotional low point during the coronavirus pandemic, when the court hearings for his asylum case — the gateway to reuniting with Dayana and meeting Ashley — were postponed indefinitely. ""It was a very big blow,"" Lazaro recounted. ""I had that expectation of meeting the baby and being with my wife and suddenly all of it fell apart."" Disillusioned, the family placed their hopes on Joe Biden, who campaigned on ending Trump administration border policies he derided as inhumane and draconian. Mr. Biden vowed to scrap the Remain in Mexico program, which he said had forced asylum-seekers to live ""in squalor."" ""I didn't sleep on Election Day,"" Lazaro said. On the day of Mr. Biden's inauguration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) suspended the Remain in Mexico policy. In February, the Biden administration said it would allow some of those returned to Mexico to continue their asylum proceedings in the U.S. as long as they had pending cases. Working with Mexico, the United Nations and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Biden administration established a process to admit these asylum-seekers at selected ports of entry. The U.N. set up a website for eligible asylum applicants to register for an appointment to enter the U.S., while IOM stood up COVID-19 testing sites. Late last month, CBS News was granted exclusive access to the Brownsville port of entry, one of six official border crossings that has been processing asylum petitioners with pending cases. More than 20 asylum-seekers arrived at the Brownsville port of entry that day through the Gateway International Bridge after testing negative for COVID-19 in Mexico. The group of asylum-seekers, which included families with children, was greeted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials. Their belongings were checked for contraband, and they were then taken inside a tent facility, where government personnel checked their case information and collected biometric data. All asylum-seekers wore face shields and masks. Barring a few cases delayed by computer glitches, the asylum applicants were processed in a matter of minutes. ""These are people that we already knew who they were,"" said Aaron Bowker, director of communications for the Office of Field Operations, the CBP branch that oversees ports of entry. ""We were able to leverage that technology and, with the help of those NGOs and those international organizations in Mexico, to get the information sent to us in advance so that when they were metered to arrive at the port of entry, it could be as smooth a process as possible."" Once the processing was completed, the group was escorted outside the port of entry and officially released from U.S. custody. A bus came to pick them up so they could begin their journey to their respective destinations, often the homes of family and friends, where they have been allowed to live while their cases are adjudicated by U.S. courts. ""We're very happy and thankful,"" a mother from Honduras told CBS News as she prepared to board the bus with her young daughter. According to DHS figures, more than 10,000 asylum-seekers have been admitted into the U.S. through this new process, including Lazaro, who was allowed to enter the country in March. Asked how he felt when he reunited with Dayana and met Ashley, Lazaro called the moment ""indescribable."" ""It was a very strong feeling,"" Dayana interjected. ""I spent two days with headaches. I would look at him every day and tell him that I couldn't believe that he was here."" ""When I saw the baby and held her — I still can't believe it,"" Lazaro added. The Biden administration has touted its drawdown of the Remain in Mexico policy as a model for the future of asylum processing at the U.S.-Mexico border, highlighting the COVID-19 testing and digital registration process. The program is a safe and orderly alternative to crossing the border illegally to request U.S. refuge, officials have said. ""Under the leadership of President Biden, we have put in place a safe and humane system to process individuals with active MPP cases as the first phase of a program to restore orderly processing at the Southwest Border,"" DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement to CBS News. ""We are moving quickly to rebuild our immigration system and undo the cruelty and chaos of the prior administration so our country again shows the world we are a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants."" So far, however, the Biden administration has kept ports of entry closed to most asylum-seekers without pending cases through ""non-essential travel"" pandemic-era restrictions. It has also continued to use the public health authority known as Title 42 invoked under former President Donald Trump to expel most migrant adults and some families to Mexico without allowing them to apply for U.S. asylum. While there has been some small-scale processing of vulnerable asylum petitioners at ports of entry in recent weeks, Biden administration officials have not said when and if large-scale processing will start, frustrating some advocates and human rights groups. ""If the administration is talking about essentially using this system for new asylum seekers, all that means is once again just having metering again,"" said Taylor Levy, an immigration attorney who helped Lazaro and Dayana, referring to the pre-pandemic U.S. practice of placing migrants on waitlists to request protection at a port of entry. ""That cannot be the only system that exists for people to be able to exercise their legal rights. It is legal to seek asylum. It is enshrined in our laws,"" Levy continued. Meanwhile, Lazaro and Dayana are looking forward to starting a new life with their daughter in the U.S. Like other asylum-seekers admitted into the U.S., they still have to continue their immigration proceedings to pursue asylum or other forms of permanent legal status. ""We hope to push forward in this country. To work and raise the baby,"" Lazaro said. ""May she grow up loving her country, loving her homeland. She is one more American that we have here."""
cbs|"President Biden visited Lake Charles, Louisiana, on Thursday as part of his nationwide tour to promote his sweeping $2.3 trillion proposal the American Jobs Plan. Mr. Biden's visit to the deep-red state of Louisiana was the latest stop on his ""Getting America Back on Track"" tour, as he tries to persuade not just Republican lawmakers but everyday Americans that his ideas are worth the massive price tag. Louisiana hasn't voted for a Democrat for president since Bill Clinton in 1996. The president first spoke with the 70-year-old Calcasieu River Bridge in the background in Lake Charles. ""When it comes to bridges and roads and the like, I've never seen a Republican or Democrat road. I just see roads,"" Mr. Biden said. The president used the Calcasieu River Bridge as an example of infrastructure that's fallen behind the times. The bridge was created to handle 37,000 crossings a day. It now handles more than 80,000 each day. ""You know when the bridge was built in 1952 there was nothing there. It was built to make sure that we in fact it was going to last for 50 years.

It has also continued to use the public health authority known as Title 42 invoked under former President Donald Trump to expel most migrant adults and some families to Mexico without allowing them to apply for U.S. asylum. While there has been some small-scale processing of vulnerable asylum petitioners at ports of entry in recent weeks, Biden administration officials have not said when and if large-scale processing will start, frustrating some advocates and human rights groups. ""If the administration is talking about essentially using this system for new asylum seekers, all that means is once again just having metering again,"" said Taylor Levy, an immigration attorney who helped Lazaro and Dayana, referring to the pre-pandemic U.S. practice of placing migrants on waitlists to request protection at a port of entry. ""That cannot be the only system that exists for people to be able to exercise their legal rights. It is legal to seek asylum. It is enshrined in our laws,"" Levy continued. Meanwhile, Lazaro and Dayana are looking forward to starting a new life with their daughter in the U.S. Like other asylum-seekers admitted into the U.S., they still have to continue their immigration proceedings to pursue asylum or other forms of permanent legal status. ""We hope to push forward in this country. To work and raise the baby,"" Lazaro said. ""May she grow up loving her country, loving her homeland. She is one more American that we have here."""
cbs|"President Biden visited Lake Charles, Louisiana, on Thursday as part of his nationwide tour to promote his sweeping $2.3 trillion proposal the American Jobs Plan. Mr. Biden's visit to the deep-red state of Louisiana was the latest stop on his ""Getting America Back on Track"" tour, as he tries to persuade not just Republican lawmakers but everyday Americans that his ideas are worth the massive price tag. Louisiana hasn't voted for a Democrat for president since Bill Clinton in 1996. The president first spoke with the 70-year-old Calcasieu River Bridge in the background in Lake Charles. ""When it comes to bridges and roads and the like, I've never seen a Republican or Democrat road. I just see roads,"" Mr. Biden said. The president used the Calcasieu River Bridge as an example of infrastructure that's fallen behind the times. The bridge was created to handle 37,000 crossings a day. It now handles more than 80,000 each day. ""You know when the bridge was built in 1952 there was nothing there. It was built to make sure that we in fact it was going to last for 50 years. That was 20 years ago,"" he said. The U.S. used to be first in the world in infrastructure, but now ranks eighth, Mr. Biden said, claiming infrastructure deficiencies cost the U.S. $160 billion a year in economic benefits. But the president cited benefits other than economic ones, too, insisting that his plan will increase the safety of travel, and make commutes shorter so workers can spend more time with their families. The president said large corporations and the very wealthy have to pay more into the country. ""Trickle down ain't working very well, man,"" he said, referencing the conservative economic theory that if businesses and the wealthy pay less in taxes, it will stimulate the economy and benefit those lower on the economic totem pole. Mr. Biden also spent time in Lake Charles on Thursday pitching the benefits of his American Families Plan, a $1.8 trillion proposal that would entail free preschool for all 3-and-4-year-olds, and two years of free community college, among other things. Lake Charles was hit by two hurricanes, Laura and Delta, in 2020, which broke the record for the most named storms. Ahead of Mr. Biden's visit, Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon sent the president a letter urging him to support additional disaster relief funding to help areas struggling to recover from natural disasters that took place in 2020 and early 2021. Mr. Biden has hit the road in recent weeks to drum up support from voters for his $2.3 trillion infrastructure package , which includes $621 billion to rebuild the nation's roads, bridges, rails and airports. A White House fact sheet examining the need for infrastructure improvements in Louisiana estimates there are 1,634 bridges and more than 3,400 miles of highway in the state that are in ""poor condition."" The president plans to pay for his infrastructure plan in part by raising the corporate tax rate to 28% and increasing the global minimum tax on U.S. multinational corporations. But Republicans have balked at the cost of Mr. Biden's plan and his proposed method of paying for it, as well as some components that GOP lawmakers say stretches the definition of ""infrastructure."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has frequently criticized the proposal, and told reporters on Wednesday that ""100% of my focus is on stopping this new administration."" He partially walked this comment back on Thursday, saying he is ""anxious to stop the Biden agenda depending on what it is."" ""I want to do business with the president, but he needs to be a moderate. He said he was going to be a moderate during the campaign. I haven't seen that yet,"" McConnell told reporters. A group of Republican senators last month put forth their own infrastructure counter-proposal , which at $568 billion is far smaller than Mr. Biden's plan. It's unclear exactly how much the president is willing to compromise, although he's expressed a willingness to compromise on the corporate tax increase. Mr. Biden's proposal calls for a 28% corporate tax rate, but Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a key vote, has pushed for nothing higher than a 25% corporate tax rate. Mr. Biden said during his remarks on Thursday that he was ""willing to hear ideas from both sides"" to improve the legislation, adding that he was meeting with congressional Republicans to see ""how much they're willing to go for."" ""I'm ready to compromise. What I'm not ready to do — I'm not ready to do nothing,"" Mr. Biden said. ""I'm not ready to have another period where American has another 'infrastructure month' that doesn't change a damn thing."" Mr. Biden also spoke with Louisiana Senators Bill Cassidy and John Kennedy, both Republicans, during his trip. Grace Segers contributed to this report."
npr|"President Biden on Tuesday is set to announce new steps to reach rural Americans in the push to get as many people as possible vaccinated for the coronavirus, a White House official tells NPR. This emphasis comes as rural hospitals are raising alarms about the pace of vaccination — even among their own employees. The Biden administration is moving into a new phase of its vaccination campaign , one where it knows doctors and health care professionals are often more persuasive than the government. It has prioritized a list of doctors enrolled in the vaccine system based on a ""social vulnerability index"" used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — including doctors in many rural communities — and has been asking state government to send vaccine doses to those doctors, the official said. The administration also plans to work with states to enroll more pediatricians and family doctors in their vaccine systems so they can begin giving people vaccines, a step that becomes ""particularly critical"" if the Food and Drug Administration gives emergency authorization for adolescents ages 12-15 to start getting the Pfizer vaccine, the official said. The administration also is working with provider groups to encourage their members to sign up to give the vaccines and will be providing technical assistance to help practices get ready for vaccination, the official said. ""Tremendously problematic"" The new steps come as some rural hospitals are finding that their own staff members are reluctant to get the shot. A new survey conducted by the National Rural Health Association and Chartis Center for Rural Health showed that 30% of the 160 rural hospital executives who responded said less than half of their employees had been vaccinated — even though health care workers have been eligible for months now. Only about a third said that 70% or more of their staff were vaccinated. ""These survey results match what we are hearing from our members and that is tremendously problematic,"" said Alan Morgan, chief executive of the National Rural Health Association. ""At a federal level, every effort to overcome vaccine hesitancy has health care professionals front and center,"" Morgan said. ""So if you've got a quarter of the nation's rural hospitals having less than 50% of their staff vaccinated, you have a problem that needs to be fixed now."" This survey also lines up with a poll done earlier this year by the Kaiser Family Foundation and The Washington Post that found 29% of health care workers in rural areas didn't plan to get the COVID-19 vaccine. That's a greater well of hesitancy than the poll found among health care workers in urban and suburban areas. Michael Topchik at Chartis said the hospitals they work with have high vaccination rates every year for the flu shot. It's required. ""We were surprised at how many rural hospitals were telling us their vaccination rates for COVID-19 were significantly lower,"" Topchik said. ""It's too early"" In Carrollton, Mo., Jeff Tindle, the chief executive at Carroll County Memorial Hospital, is beside himself about the low rate of vaccination among his staff. Only 59% are vaccinated for COVID-19 and at this point he doesn't have much hope of that number growing dramatically. Tindle, who describes himself as conservative, like most people in his town, said he had assumed that health care workers would understand the importance of the vaccine. ""I'm disappointed that we built in so many safeguards ... first and foremost to protect our employees, and yet we had almost 40% who chose not to help themselves,"" he said. The hospital had a vaccine clinic but shut it down, turning its attention to helping the public health department. Most of the people who wanted to get vaccinated in the town of 4,000 have already done so, he said. ""We're worried about always wasting vaccine because we just don't have enough arms,"" he said. Talking to friends, Tindle says some have told him they are afraid of being implanted with microchips, a false conspiracy theory alive and well on the internet. ""Employees that I talk to, health care employees, will be a little more rational in their irrational behavior by saying, 'Well Jeff, we don't have enough studies. It's too early,' "" he said. ""I know that swayed people"" Some rural hospitals have had better luck getting employees vaccinated. Memorial Hospital in New Hampshire's Mount Washington Valley region is currently at 78%. Will Owen, who is running the hospital's community vaccination clinic, said education was key. In December, a highly respected local physician named Victor Lazaron sent a letter to staff. ""I am keen to be vaccinated as soon as possible,"" Lazaron said in the letter. He cited studies showing vaccines were effective and that the worst side effects were comparable to the vaccine for shingles, which is widely used. ""I hope you all will choose to be vaccinated as soon as the vaccine is available to you. In my judgment it is the best way forward. It is safe and effective. And it will help us get back to our core mission: protecting the health of our friends and neighbors in the Mount Washington Valley,"" Lazaron wrote. That letter opened people's minds to the vaccine, Owen said. ""I know that letter swayed people, because I had people tell me that,"" he said. There were also Zoom sessions for staff, led by doctors, leaving plenty of time for questions. Having trusted doctors and nurses vaccinated has been reassuring to others in the broader community, said chief nursing officer Kris Dascoulias, whose roots in the community are so deep that she was born in Memorial Hospital, where she now works. ""I've gotten lots of text messages, questions. I think people relied on the hospital community that they knew and trusted to guide them a little bit in this,"" Dascoulias said. She said she has encouraged people, telling them, ""I know it's a little scary, it's a little bit of a leap of faith, but you know it's better than the alternatives."" White House looks to local doctors The White House knows that doctors and other trusted local leaders will be the way to break through pockets of hesitancy in rural communities, said Bechara Choucair, the White House vaccinations coordinator. Choucair also pointed to a different Kaiser Family Foundation poll that found a majority of rural residents had been vaccinated or planned to get vaccinated, although it also shows a much smaller share of urban and suburban residents would ""definitely not"" get the shot than those in rural areas. ""Luckily we know that the overwhelming majority of health care providers are very supportive of the vaccine. Ninety percent of doctors and master's-prepared nurses have either gotten the vaccine or are in the process of getting vaccinated,"" Choucair told NPR, citing national data about doctors and highly trained nurses. ""We need to do that across the board for health care professionals and non-health care professionals and will continue to do that,"" he said."
npr|"The presidential inauguration ceremony on Wednesday looked a lot different than in previous years. Masks were a reminder of a pandemic still raging. The ceremonial parade was canceled and some customs went virtual . In a historically rare snub, a sitting President Trump was absent for the swearing-in ceremony of his successor, Joe Biden. But, at least for the sartorially minded, an abundance of strategically selected outfits helped elevate an unusual and scaled-back ceremony. There were repurposed woolen mittens , elaborate face masks and dramatic collars. Over on social media, amateur fashion sleuths looked on, attaching symbolism and pronouncing the emergence of new clothing aesthetics. Bright color choices told their own stories and paid tribute to leaders past. There was Amanda Gorman , the youngest inaugural poet in history, who captivated the country with the reading of her poem, ""The Hill We Climb."" In a vibrant canary yellow Miuccia Prada coat, a red satin Prada headband and a red mask to match, the 22-year-old stood out in a sea of muted tones and indistinguishable suits. The yellow, Gorman told Vogue , was her way of paying homage to first lady Jill Biden. The first lady asked Gorman to recite an original poem at her husband's swearing-in last month after she was moved by Gorman's reading of her poem, ""In This Place: An American Lyric,"" in 2017 at the Library of Congress. Gorman told the magazine: Jill Biden said, ""I saw this video of you and you were wearing yellow and I loved it."" The poet also wore gold hoops and a ring in the shape of a caged bird, a present from Oprah Winfrey as a tribute to Maya Angelou and her poem, ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings."" Lady Gaga, a pop star synonymous with drama, belted out the national anthem in custom Schiaparelli haute couture: a fitted navy jacket and a billowy red silk skirt. Washington Post humor columnist Alexandra Petri thought Gaga's severe attire might as well have been plucked from a Hunger Games movie. With an unmissable golden dove brooch pinned to her chest, though, the avant-garde shapeshifter insists she was sending a message of peace to a divided nation: ""A dove carrying an olive branch,"" Gaga tweeted . ""May we all make peace with each other."" Jennifer Lopez followed co-headliner Lady Gaga in a Victorian chic look ( Pride and Prejudice , but make it glam). J.Lo's all-white Chanel ensemble featured a ruffled blouse buttoned to the top of her neck. Her pants, loose and sequined, contrasted with the rigidity of her tweed coat. Looks aside, Twitter users collectively lost their minds when the performer summoned a sampling of her 1999 hit, ""Let's Get Loud,"" during her rendition of ""This Land Is Your Land."" Ella Emhoff, stepdaughter to Vice President Harris, turned out in full 20-something art-student-from-Brooklyn glory ( or so some social media users observed). She arrived at the Capitol wearing a dramatic tweed coat from Miu Miu adorned with a frilly oversized collar. Underneath was a Batsheva dress — reminiscent of the prairie-chic style dominating Instagram Explore pages . Emhoff's stylists, Jill Lincoln and Jordan Johnson , completed the look with chunky black boots and a thin hairband. Appearing to hold down his socially distanced 6-foot perimeter, Bernie Sanders gave onlookers an unobstructed view of his take on "" grumpy chic ."" The Vermont senator's understated look stood out among the formal-clad masses. Staying loyal to his Green Mountain State roots, he wore a hefty parka from Burton, a Vermont-based snowboarding brand. As astute Tweeters noted, Sanders wore the same coat in a now famous ""I am once again asking"" meme that originated from a video in which he asks for donations back when he was on the campaign trail. Burton Snowboards took it as an opportunity to offer fans a Bernie-inspired budget-friendly look . It was also hard to overlook the senator's repurposed sweater-wool mittens — gifted to him a couple of years ago by Jen Ellis, a teacher in Vermont , a backstory noted by Buzzfeed reporter Ruby Cramer. Despite all appearances, his inauguration presence was not a pit stop on an errand run, as some on Twitter suggested . Where Sanders comes from, he told CBS in an interview following the ceremony, ""We're not so concerned about good fashion — we want to keep warm. And that's what I did today."" Similarly, Janet Yellen prioritized comfort over fashion in freezing-cold temps. The former chair of the Federal Reserve, and Biden's pick for Treasury secretary, was nestled inside of her black puffer jacket. She draped a blue blanket over her knees for added toastiness. Biden's granddaughters arrived at the Capitol looking like an all-woman supergroup, according to several Twitter users who said they thought the pop rock-band Haim arrived to perform at the inauguration. They were decked out in monochromatic outfits, down to their masks and gloves. Plus, the combination of pink, camel and white struck some as the human embodiment of Neapolitan ice cream . Not least of all, Vice President Harris made history while outfitted in a bold purple coat and matching dress by Christopher John Rogers, a young Black designer who hails from Louisiana. CNN journalist Abby Phillip remarked that purple is a special color to Harris as a ""nod to Shirley Chisholm ,"" the first Black woman elected to Congress and whom the vice president has cited as inspiration for her political career. It's also a color of the women's suffrage movement, as NPR reported . Opting for a plum pantsuit, former first lady Michelle Obama, too, stuck to the color theme that, as a blend of colors red and blue, has also traditionally signaled bipartisanship or unity. Farah Eltohamy is an intern on NPR's Digital News desk. A maskless President Biden addressed the nation Wednesday night standing at the feet of Abraham Lincoln Memorial during a televised and star-studded celebration of the historic inauguration. ""We're good people,"" he reassured viewers, before picking up the theme of his earlier speech on the steps of the Capitol. ""Unity forces us to come together in common love that defines us as Americans,"" Biden said. The 46th president urged the public to come together, saying it's ""the only way we'll get through the darkness around us."" He noted that the obstacles facing the nation — including the pandemic currently ravaging communities across the country, racial injustices and the climate crisis — are  ""threats to our very democracy."" ""Will we meet the moment like our forbearers have?"" Biden asked. ""I believe we must and I believe we will,"" he said. ""You, the American people are the reason why I have never been more optimistic about America than I am this very day."" He added: ""America is built of decency and dignity of love and healing of greatness and goodness. Of possibility."" The inaugural program, called Celebrating America , featured several tributes to the extraordinary efforts by nurses, doctors, teachers and other frontline workers who have stepped up throughout the coronavirus pandemic. In her first remarks to the nation as vice president, Kamala Harris echoed the president's call to unite in the days ahead. ""In many ways this moment embodies our character as nation,"" she said in a brief address to the audience. ""Even in dark times, we not only dream, we do. We shoot for the moon and then we plant our flag on it,"" Harris said. ""We are bold, we are fearless and ambitious. We are undaunted in our believe that we shall overcome that we will rise up."" She added: ""A great experiment takes great determination. The will to do the work and then the wisdom to keep refining, keep tinkering, keep perfecting."" Although much of the program hit several somber notes, the two-hour show was interspersed with several performances by a variety of singers, musicians, artists and actors. Among them, John Legend sang Nina Simone's Feeling Good. Justin Timberlake and Ant Clemons performed Better Days. Puerto Rican singers Ozuna and Luis Fonsi sang their respective mega-hits, Taki Taki and Despacito , in Spanish. And Katy Perry's  Firework, served as the soundtrack to a stunning firework show over the White House and the National Mall that capped off the celebration. The Senate has voted to confirm Avril Haines to be director of national intelligence, making her President Biden's first Cabinet-level official to receive Senate confirmation. The vote was 84-10.  Her confirmation comes after Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., briefly held up the process, asking for a written response from her about a question during her confirmation hearing a day earlier. ""I no longer object,"" Cotton said Wednesday evening, noting that Haines had provided him with a response. ""In her open session yesterday, she gave an answer in response to Sen. Ron Wyden that suggested the intelligence community might reopen investigations into detention interrogation programs from 2001 to 2006,"" Cotton said. ""She clarified in the private setting that she had no intention to open up those investigations and expose operations officers inside the CIA to criminal prosecution, or adverse employment action, or even holding it against them in potential future promotions or placements."" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., had tweeted earlier Wednesday that he wasn't attending Biden's inauguration to work to expedite a vote on Haines' nomination. ""It's important we do this as soon as possible,"" he wrote. Haines' confirmation prevents a situation where Biden would begin his presidency with no members of his national security team firmly in place, as is customary . During her Tuesday confirmation hearing , Haines began her opening statement with tacit criticism of President Trump. ""When it comes to intelligence, there is simply no place for politics, ever,"" she said. She pledged to declassify an intelligence report about the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and promised an ""aggressive response"" to China to counter its ""illegal and unfair practices."" Haines, 51, previously was deputy national security adviser. She also was deputy chief counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2007-2008 when Biden was chairman. In 2013, President Barack Obama named her deputy CIA director, the first woman to hold the job. She now makes history again as the first woman to hold the top job in U.S. intelligence. When Biden announced Haines in November as his pick to lead the intelligence community, she vowed to ""speak truth to power."" ""I've worked for you for a long time, and I accept this nomination knowing that you would never want me to do otherwise and that you value the perspective of the intelligence community,"" she said at the time. ""And that you will do so even when what I have to say may be inconvenient or difficult, and I assure you, there will be those times."" President Biden's initial wave of planned executive actions includes an order to reexamine one controversial, but widely used, pesticide called chlorpyrifos. The Trump administration had stepped in to keep the chemical on the market after Obama-era officials tried to ban it. It's just one in a long list of science-related Trump administration actions that the incoming Biden team will now revisit. In a statement, Biden promised to take a close look at all policies ""that were harmful to public health, damaging to the environment, unsupported by the best available science, or otherwise not in the national interest."" Farmers use chlorpyrifos to control insects on a wide variety of crops, including corn, apples, and vegetables. It is among the most toxic pesticides. Workers exposed to it can experience dizziness, headaches, and nausea. Most indoor uses of the pesticide were halted in 2001. More recently, however, researchers at Columbia University studied health records from women who'd been exposed to this chemical before that ban, and found evidence that exposure to tiny amounts of chlorpyrifos harmed the brains of their developing fetuses and young children. Those studies, along with lawsuits filed by environmental advocates, convinced the Environmental Protection Agency to move ahead with a ban during the final months of the Obama administration. When the Trump administration took office in 2017, the new EPA leadership put that decision on hold and later reversed it. This was due in large part to the agency's decision to exclude evidence from the Columbia University studies, because university researchers refused to turn over raw data from those studies. The researchers maintain that this would violate the confidentiality of the women whom they'd studied. California , meanwhile, moved ahead with its own regulations. It banned sales of chlorpyrifos in the state in early 2020. Starting this year, California's farmers no longer can spray the chemical. The Biden administration now will take a fresh look at chlorpyrifos, as well as the EPA's rules that justified excluding the Columbia University studies. In addition, the incoming administration will revisit a Trump administration decision to shrink the buffer zones around fields that have to be free of people when pesticides are applied. Farmworker advocates have challenged that decision in court. Updated at 8:23 p.m. ET The Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all hit new records as markets closed on Wednesday afternoon. The achievement was notched right in the middle of Inauguration Day celebrations, as the Biden administration played a montage of dancing and singing across America. There just may have been some celebratory shimmies on Wall Street, too. The Dow rose nearly 1% to 31,188.  The tech-heavy NASDAQ closing nearly 2% higher at 13,457, while the broader S&P 500 rose 1.39% to end the day at about 3,852. The stock market has been surging for months, despite the economic anguish caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The Nasdaq has more than doubled  since its pandemic low point back in March. Overall, stock market performance was very strong during the Trump presidency — annualized returns were almost as high as they were during the Obama administration. (Under President Bill Clinton, stock values soared even more.) More than any other president, Trump pointed to stock markets gains as his own personal success, although he did not seem to consider stock market losses in the same light . He repeatedly warned that a Biden win would cause markets to crash. A market crash is never out of the question, and some analysts worry we're in or approaching a bubble. But so far, Biden's win has not sent investors into a tailspin. Instead, many on Wall Street seem to believe that the veteran politician, famous for striking legislative deals, can work with Congress to push significantly more stimulus spending , which could boost stocks even higher. Of course, stock markets respond to many forces outside a chief executive's control, and neither Trump nor Biden can take full credit for the stock markets recent rise. Updated 5:45pm Eastern Time In one of his first acts in the Oval Office, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to have the United States rejoin the Paris climate agreement, the largest international effort to curb global warming. The U.S. officially withdrew from the accord to limit climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions late last year, after President Donald Trump began the process in 2017. It is the only country of the nearly 200 signatories that has withdrawn. Biden vowed to sign on Inauguration Day the documents needed to rejoin the agreement. The U.S. played a large role in creating the 2015 agreement. It aims to avoid the most catastrophic climate change scenarios by keeping average global temperatures from rising no more than 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably less than 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100, compared to pre-industrial times. Global temperatures have already increased by a little more than one degree Celsius. ""The window for meaningful action is now very narrow – we have no time to waste,"" said Dr. M. Sanjayan, chief executive  of Conservation International, an environmental advocacy group. ""President Biden's action today is certainly a step in the right direction."" It will take 30 days for the U.S. to officially rejoin the agreement, but meeting its targets is going to be a taller order. The U.S. is the second-largest producer of carbon emissions, behind China, and has contributed more to global climate change over time than any other country. As a candidate, Biden made a bold pledge to cut all greenhouse gas emissions from the nation's electric sector by 2035 and to make the country carbon-neutral by 2050. Carbon emissions have been decreasing from the country's electricity sector as coal plants have been retired over the last decade and utilities ramp up their reliance on renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Industrial and transportation sources of carbon emissions are going to be harder to curtail. In 2017, transportation overtook electricity generation as the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. Biden is expected to stiffen auto emissions standards, but writing new rules takes time. Still, Biden's move to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement signals to the world that the U.S. is serious about addressing climate change again, and that it will have a seat at the table when world leaders meet in Glasgow to make new climate pledges later this year. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres welcomed the American re-entry into the climate agreement. In an emailed statement, he wrote: ""We look forward to the leadership of United States in accelerating global efforts towards net zero."" They gathered long distance via Zoom, garlanded with pearls in homage to Kamala Harris's signature neckwear, and with champagne bottles ready to pop. Eight Black women, who for the past 25 years have belonged to what they call the Brown Girls Book Club, could not miss the opportunity to join together for this historic moment: the inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, who becomes the first woman, first African American, and first Asian American vice president. ""I need this moment for me,"" said Vivian Wallace-Llodra, 50, a senior content strategist with JP Morgan Chase in New York, who sported a T-shirt reading ""Kamala and Joe"" (because ""first, her!"" she explained) and a cobalt blue pantsuit in tribute to Hillary Clinton. ""What's that song, 'It's been a long time coming?' "" Wallace-Llodra asked. ""Change gonna come! "" chimed in Rachel Giordani, 49, an instructional coach in New York, proudly decked out in a red Howard University sweatshirt. Many of those in the group are alumnae of Howard, Harris's alma mater, or fellow members of her sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, and they felt a special connection to this day. As they waited for the ceremony to begin, the women said the joy they felt was shaded by the damage done during the Trump presidency. ""I feel like today and in the days that are coming, we're all going to be recovering from PTSD,"" said Wallace-Llodra. ""Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is a return to normalcy."" The group turned euphoric when former first lady Michelle Obama appeared on the stage in a belted burgundy ensemble, her hair in a sleek, wavy blowout. ""Go ahead, Michelle!"" they shouted. ""Look at Shelly!"" ""Today we fierce!"" ""That's a helluva belt buckle!"" ""Forget it, she snacks from head to toe!"" When Harris emerged from the Capitol in a royal purple coat and matching dress, the women erupted in jubilant cheers, which quickly turned to sobs as they absorbed the weight of the moment. ""Oh my god,"" they said, wiping away tears. ""Wow."" Monica Brady, 49, a middle school principal in New York City, called the new vice president ""a kick-ass woman who would very easily fit in this set ... We see us reflected back to us, not just in her brownness, but her fierceness. She is a fierce woman! And everybody on this line is as well."" After Harris and Biden were sworn in, the women whooped and raised their glasses high in a toast, some with champagne, others with sparkling water and iced coffee. ""I love you guys,"" Giordani told her friends, before adding, ""We have a lot of work to do."" The women sipped as they listened to President Biden speak of unity and healing in his inaugural address, urging Americans to ""hear one another, see one another, show respect to one another."" Afterward, reflecting on his words, Wallace-Llodra said, ""I know a lot of people are a little offended by these calls for unity. I'm not, you know? Unify. Embrace them. They'll either come along or they won't."" She added, ""Now personally, the cynic in me thinks that they won't come along because they haven't. But there's nothing wrong with trying."" Former President Donald Trump did not declare martial law in his final minutes in office; nor did he reveal a secret plan to remain in power forever. President Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were not sent to Guantánamo Bay. The military did not rise up and arrest Democratic leaders en masse. Instead, Biden took the oath of office and became the 46th U.S. president on Wednesday. For some supporters of QAnon, this was an earth-shattering turn of events. Or rather, nonevents. QAnon is less a baseless conspiracy theory than an umbrella of many baseless conspiracy theories, but it centers on a belief that there is a shadowy cabal of pedophilic, satanic world leaders. For years, a mysterious figure called Q has issued promises that this cabal is on the verge of being exposed and defeated by Trump in a cataclysmic event that QAnon calls ""the Storm."" The baseless, often bizarre claims have gained a shocking amount of traction with the public. A recent NPR/Ipsos poll found that 17% of Americans believe that a group of Satan-worshipping, child-enslaving elites is trying to control the world, and another 37% aren't sure about the false allegation. And two women who have expressed some support for QAnon, Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene , are now sitting members of Congress. Now that Trump has left office, some QAnon supporters are baffled — or even giving up. New York Times tech columnist Kevin Roose tweeted out screenshots from groups on Telegram — a popular messaging service for QAnon supporters — on Wednesday, after the transfer of power was officially complete. ""Been played like fools,"" one wrote . Roose noted that one particularly prominent QAnon figure publicly announced that supporters need to ""go back to our lives as best we are able,"" rather than continue trying to overthrow Biden's presidency. Will Sommer, who tracks conservative media and is working on a book about QAnon, wrote in the Daily Beast that even late on Wednesday morning, QAnon groups were still hopeful that the mass arrests would materialize. But after noon, ""the mood changed quickly,"" Sommer wrote, with supporters saying they felt fooled by Trump and felt sick. Feeling fooled may not lead to a return to normalcy. One researcher told NBC News that frustrated, disappointed Q followers could be prime targets for radicalization by other extremist groups, like neo-Nazis. And, of course, not every Q follower is giving up the faith (an appropriate word — some argue that Q is best understood as a religious movement ). The Times' Roose noted Q fans arguing with each other, with some declaring the movement over while others insisting the Storm was still coming. NBC's Ben Collins and Brandy Zadrozny took a look at one of the largest QAnon Telegram groups, which briefly shut down on Wednesday and reopened with ""a range of reactions: confusion and realization that QAnon was in fact a hoax, as well as renewed commitment to the conspiracy theory, despite its unreliability."" Researcher Travis View told The Washington Post  that it was only a ""minority ... facing reality,"" while others are simply shifting their expectations. It's a process they're familiar with, after all: A multitude of Q predictions has failed to materialize, and that has never stopped the conspiracies from spreading. Like apocalyptic cults that persist despite a noteworthy lack of apocalypse, QAnon may survive the failed prophecies around the inauguration just like it has survived other failed prophecies before. President Biden is moving quickly on climate change on his first day in office, saying he plans to sign a sweeping executive order to undo many of the Trump administration's environmental rollbacks. Biden's pledge to rejoin the international Paris climate accord tops his list of immediate steps. Former President Donald Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the landmark agreement in 2017, which was completed in November . The Trump administration also weakened or undid other, lesser-known climate and environmental policies that Biden has vowed to restore. Biden will instruct federal agencies to review more than 100 policies, many crucial to curbing heat-trapping emissions, including fuel economy standards for cars and pollution limits on the oil and gas industry . ""A cry for survival comes from the planet itself, a cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear,"" Biden said in his inaugural address Wednesday. The Trump administration systematically loosened Obama-era environmental standards that range from energy-efficiency standards for appliances and buildings to air quality standards designed to protect public health. Some of those rollbacks, such as fuel economy standards for cars and trucks, went further than the industry wanted. Under President Barack Obama, automakers had negotiated efficiency standards that gradually became tougher year after year. Federal agencies under Trump instead froze the standards, leading some automakers to agree  voluntarily to continue with the tougher rules. Fuel efficiency of cars and trucks in the U.S. fell for the first time in five years in 2019, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Transportation is the country's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. The Biden administration will also  instruct the federal government to consider the long-term economic impacts of climate change when making new regulations, what's known as the ""social cost"" of carbon . Under Obama, those costs were weighed against the immediate cost a new regulation might pose to an industry, given that climate impacts are increasingly costing billions across many economic sectors. The Trump administration did away with that practice in 2017. Biden is reestablishing the working group to issue those guidelines, including weighing ""environmental justice and intergenerational equity"" considerations. The planned moves were applauded by environmental groups, who warn the U.S. has little time to act to cut emissions. Scientists say the world is on track to exceed 1.5 Celsius degrees of warming, which will lead to higher sea level rise and more extreme heat waves and hurricanes. ""The sweeping nature of these executive orders are an important down payment in addressing the tatters left behind by President Trump,"" Kathleen Rest, executive director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement. ""They seek to reverse policies that fly in the face of science, harm public health and degrade the environment."" Updated at 9:37 p.m. ET Michael Pack resigned Wednesday as the CEO of the federal agency over the Voice of America and other federally funded international broadcasters after a turbulent seven-month tenure. He leaves the U.S. Agency for Global Media with a Trumpian legacy of ideological strife, lawsuits and scandal, his departure effective just two hours after the swearing-in of President Biden, who requested him to leave. Biden has named senior VOA news executive Kelu Chao as acting CEO. Pack came to lead the U.S. Agency for Global Media with the support of former President Donald Trump; his appointment was delayed more than two years in the U.S. Senate by lawmakers who feared he was too ideological and also who questioned his finances. The soft-spoken conservative documentary maker proved to be an ideological warrior in the mold of his patron , taking to one conservative news outlet after another to denounce his own staff, all in the name of fairness. In his resignation letter, Pack said he was ""solely focused upon reorienting the agency toward its missions."" And he attacked the request for his resignation as ""a partisan act,"" saying the leadership of the agency and its networks ""is meant to be non-partisan, untethered to alternations in the political regime."" He added, ""I had no political agenda coming into USAGM, and I still do not have one."" NPR conducted scores of interviews over the controversies Pack's actions engendered. And few at the agency or its broadcasters agreed with Pack's characterization of his mission or performance, instead characterizing him as seeking political control over their coverage. Just last week, a VOA reporter's insistent questions to then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and VOA Director Robert R. Reilly over the siege on Congress after a public event led to her demotion and an investigation.  Pack routinely accused journalists of anti-Trump bias, sought to fire top executives as part of a ""deep state,"" ominously accused the networks of being receptive to foreign spies and denied requests for visa extensions from his own staffers who are foreign nationals. He initiated investigations over the bias claims, reaching into Voice of America's newsroom in ways a federal judge said broke the law and the First Amendment. Pack hired a Richmond, Va., law firm to investigate top U.S. Agency for Global Media executives after already seeking to oust them; new allegations, backed by correspondence reviewed by NPR, suggest he paid more than $2 million to that firm to conduct such reviews. (The lead partner on the investigation, John D. Adams, was a law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, the subject of a sympathetic 2020 documentary by Pack.) Pack even fired White House aides assigned to help him by the Trump administration, suspecting them of disloyalty. Throughout, he kept all but a small circle of advisers in the dark as to what he was doing. Former U.S. Agency for Global Media general counsel David Kligerman said the agency would have to work hard to put a ""terrible chapter"" behind it. Kligerman, who resigned late last month, had been suspended by Pack in August, along with other senior executives after Pack was unable to fire them more immediately. ""Pack seemed only to know how to destroy,"" Kligerman wrote in a statement to NPR, citing the CEO's record of ""firing or otherwise pushing out so many talented journalists, network heads, grantee board members, and civil servants."" ""It was wanton destruction, and shocking disregard for the most basic civility or norms,"" Kligerman wrote. ""Political staff targeted and terrorized career staff and others. It is hard to overstate the climate of fear and dread that existed at the Agency. It is then particularly ironic that in his letter of resignation Pack warns of future politicalization of the Agency: it is hard to see how one could have attempted to do more to politicize the Agency than Pack."" Pack sought to ensure his influence endured after his departure by forcing the  networks the agency funds but does not own to accept new boards of directors stocked with conservative activists and writers. The networks include Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks. (VOA and Radio/TV Marti are owned by the federal government.) The new board members, announced this month, include Roger L. Simon, a columnist for the pro-Trump and conspiracy-theory recycling newspaper The Epoch Times who has written he believes the Jan. 6 attack on Congress by a pro-Trump mob was actually done by leftists in disguise, and Christian Whiton, a conservative foreign policy expert who has defended Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. According to three people with knowledge, the new Biden team appears poised to bring suspended executives back into the agency fold, replace the network chiefs appointed by Pack last month and to appoint new boards. The Biden administration did not immediately comment on Pack's departure. A permanent CEO for the U.S. Agency for Global Media will require approval by the Senate, now led by Democrats rather than Republicans, though Pack inspired an outcry on both sides of the aisle. Disclosure: This story was reported by NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik and edited by NPR media and technology editor Emily Kopp. Because of NPR CEO John Lansing's prior role as CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, no senior news executive or corporate executive at NPR reviewed this story before it was published.  Updated at 5:06 p.m. ET Democrats officially took control of the Senate as Georgia's two new Democratic senators-elect were sworn in Wednesday afternoon, cementing a 50-50 split, with Vice President Harris serving as the tiebreaking vote in her new role as president of the the Senate. Harris administered the oath  of office to  Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff hours  after her own swearing-in. The pair of Democratic victories in the Jan. 5 Senate runoff elections gave the party control of both the White House and Congress, with the thinnest of majorities in the upper chamber. Harris also swore in Democrat Alex Padilla, the former California secretary of state, to fill Harris' own Senate seat. He was appointed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat. ""The chair lays before the Senate ... a certificate of appointment to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of former Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California,"" she said, laughing, before adding, ""Yeah, that was very weird."" With the new senators' swearing-in complete, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., becomes the Senate majority leader and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the minority leader. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. , became the new president pro tempore of the Senate, placing him third in the line of succession to the presidency. He previously held this position from 2012 to 2015. Details of a power-sharing agreement are still being developed by Schumer and McConnell to lay out practical issues about the chamber's operations going forward. A Democratic majority, however narrow, will enable the party to set the chamber's legislative agenda and make it easier to confirm President Biden's Cabinet picks. Georgia's Secretary of State's office certified the results of the runoff elections the day before Biden's inauguration. Biden was  the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Georgia since 1992. Ossoff and Warnock's wins were also history-making. Ossoff is the state's first Jewish senator and Warnock is Georgia's first Black senator and the first Black Democratic senator from the South. Padilla's appointment is also historic: He is the first Latino to represent California in the U.S. Senate. President Joe Biden has picked a slate of nearly two dozen acting officials to temporarily lead agencies as he waits for Congress to confirm his Cabinet . According to a list of officials issued by the White House on Wednesday, most of the temporary leaders are career civil servants. Still, the 46th president entered the White House on Inauguration Day with no Cabinet members yet confirmed by the Senate, making him the first president in recent history to take charge of the nation without key advisors in place. Here's a full list of those who will be assisting in the next phase of the transition of government: Five of Biden's Cabinet nominees faced Senate panels on Tuesday in the first step of the confirmation process. Among them were Janet Yellen, selected to lead the Treasury Department; Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden's choice to head the Department of Homeland Security; Antony Blinken to helm the State Department; retired Gen. Lloyd Austin for Secretary of Defense; and Avril Haines, to lead the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Prior to his swearing in, Biden pledged he'd hit the ground running on a number of his top priorities , ranging from reversing former President Trump's travel ban on Muslim-majority nations to rejoining the Paris Climate Accord, and taking the reigns on plans to curb the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging the nation. Biden is expected to sign 17 executive actions within the first few hours of his presidency. President Biden, Vice President Harris and their families received a presidential escort to the White House on Wednesday afternoon, hours after the new administration was officially sworn into office. Biden's ride to the White House came as part of a day of inauguration activities, including the swearing in ceremony at the Capitol and a wreath-laying event at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery. Biden's motorcade was met by a military procession as he made his way to his new home at the White House. Joining in with supporters and a marching band, the new president got out of his vehicle just outside of the executive mansion to greet well-wishers and the media, including Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and famed weatherman Al Roker. He completed the rest of the trip to the White House on foot. Biden plans to get an early start on his presidential duties, including the planned signing of 17 executive orders aimed at tackling the coronavirus pandemic, the climate crisis, racial justice and the economy, among other issues. The president is expected to hold events well into the evening, including virtually swearing in presidential appointees and an appearance on the Blue Room Balcony. Inauguration Day wouldn't be complete without a meme or two to mark the occasion. The creation of memes on the day when past presidents and lawmakers watch as a new president takes the oath of office has become somewhat of a hallmark in recent years. Who can forget, for example, former President George W. Bush's trials with a rain poncho during former President Trump's inauguration? Wednesday offered several viable contenders for the most celebrated meme of the day. There's several dedicated to former First Lady Michelle Obama's stunning  burgundy Sergio Hudson ensemble, and the change in expression on her face from the last time she attended a presidential inauguration. And Lady Gaga, who sang the national anthem, had fans comparing her outfit with that of the character Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games . No doubt, Jennifer Lopez, who also performed during the inaugural ceremony, and her fiancé Alex Rodriguez' elaborate U.S. Capitol photo shoot will lead to some promising memes as well. But it was Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a former presidential contender himself, whose expression and cozy coat stole the show. Some had praise for his choice of mittens. Still others were amused at the senator's outfit selection and curmudgeonly expression. Others appreciated the sensible choice of outerwear on a chilly day in D.C. Some pointed out that the jacket, which appears to be from Burton, a snowboarding company based in his home state of Vermont, is the same one Sanders wore in his now-famous ""I am once again asking"" video . Still more speculated at what was in the envelope the 79-year-old senator was carrying. And others lifted the image of the senator and placed him in various locations. President Biden invoked what he called seven ""common objects we, as Americans, love"" in Wednesday's inaugural address. Biden's embrace of the seventh — ""the truth"" — offered a pointed critique of his predecessor (though never by name), the media and the nation itself. ""Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson,"" Biden said in an event carried by every major broadcast news outlet in the country and many abroad. ""There is truth and there are lies. Lies told for power and for profit.  And each of us has a duty and a responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders, leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation, to defend the truth and defeat the lies."" Biden was overlooking the National Mall from the balcony of Congress as he made his remarks. And the ""painful lesson"" he referred to came from the role of lies and false claims amplified, in part, by conservative media outlets in inspiring the deadly and destructive assault on the U.S. Capitol building two weeks ago. Fox News hosts, commentators and guests were among those most prominently and falsely claiming that former President Donald Trump had been cheated of victory in the November election. And many of them also inflamed passions ahead of the Jan. 6 demonstration that turned into a riot, calling for a physical response to show Congress and then-Vice President Pence that they would not accept the certification of Biden's win. ""Look, I understand that many of my fellow Americans view the future with fear and trepidation. I understand they worry about their jobs,"" Biden said in his speech Wednesday, invoking his own father's fears about paying for mortgage and medical costs. ""I promise you, I get it. But the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting those who don't look like you. Or worship the way you do. Or don't get their news from the same sources you do."" Fox's coverage on Wednesday was largely affirming and laudatory of the new president's oratory and performance. The network has not publicly accounted for its own role in the divisions and wild conspiracy theories of the past five years, often circulated by Trump's associates and given true flight on Fox. Yet Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace declared Biden's inaugural address the best he had ever heard. And Wallace had a caution for his colleagues and rivals. ""I think that it was a call to all of us,"" Wallace told viewers , ""whether it's us on the air on cable or broadcast, whether it's us in social media, on our Twitter accounts, understanding that we have to deal from facts, from the truth, to hear each other out, as he said. A right to disagree, but not a right to violence."" Several Republican lawmakers reacted Wednesday to President Biden's inaugural address with optimism that both parties will be able to work together and find common ground as the new administration begins. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said the speech was ""very well-done."" ""I thought it's what we needed,"" she told Capitol Hill reporters following the address. Murkowski said that ""everything is possible"" when it comes to the Republican Party working with the Biden administration. ""We're going to have some issues that we just fundamentally disagree with. But I think, to the president's words, you can still disagree from a policy perspective and you can do so in ways that are still respectful and allow you to continue to work toward other goals."" Murkowski was the first Republican senator to call on former President Donald Trump to resign in the wake of the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection on the U.S. Capitol. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, another Republican critic of Trump, called Biden's words ""strong"" and ""very much needed."" ""We as a nation come together if we are told the truth and if we have leaders who stand for enduring American principles,"" he said. Romney's statement about telling the truth echoes comments he made the night of Jan. 6 after a violent mob of pro-Trump extremists breached the Capitol and forced lawmakers to delay by several hours their task of tallying the Electoral College votes. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine., told reporters Biden's speech ""struck the right themes of unity, a call for us to come together, to stop viewing one another as adversaries but rather as fellow Americans."" Regarding working with the Biden administration going forward, Collins expressed optimism. ""Many of us have long-standing relationships with him,"" she said. ""I served with him for many years as fellow senators, and I worked with him when he was vice president. So I stand ready to work with him to advance common goals. We'll see what his agenda is."" Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., also tweeted his support for Biden, writing , ""I commend President Biden for his call for national unity, and his assurance to those who did not support him that he will nevertheless be president for all Americans."" With a razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate, Biden will likely need some Republican support for his legislative agenda. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., told reporters he thinks it's ""important to unite the country,"" but that he has reservations over some of Biden's impending executive orders. ""My concern is, of course, some of the executive orders that are coming, specifically in regard to the Keystone XL pipeline,"" he told reporters Wednesday afternoon. Biden is revoking a cross-border presidential permit needed to finish the Keystone XL pipeline, which likely means the end of the $8 billion project. The traditional inaugural parade was not an option this year, given security fears and the coronavirus pandemic. So instead, the Biden Inaugural Committee is throwing a ""Parade Across America"" — a virtual celebration involving dancers, drum lines, singers and athletes from across the United States. It might sound like a stretch. But the Democratic Party had a surprise hit on its hands when it convened a remote roll call during the Democratic National Convention, which turned out to be more popular than you might have guessed. The University of Delaware and Howard University, the alma maters of President Biden and Vice President Harris, respectively, did send drum lines that are physically in Washington, D.C., and will perform live. Otherwise, the parade will be remote. The Parade Across America will be hosted by Tony Goldwyn, and the names in the lineup include Jon Stewart, the reunited New Radicals (of ""You Get What You Give"" fame), Earth, Wind & Fire and, as the Biden Inaugural Committee puts it, ""everyday Americans."" It will also feature figure skaters, Olympians, at least one skateboarder, representatives of every branch of the military, a wheelchair basketball program, a doctor who's big on TikTok, an 80-year-old performer from Idaho, a 12-year-old trumpeter from Georgia, marching bands, flag twirlers, a clogging group, Boy Scouts and a Dance Across America led by Kenny Ortega. You can view the full lineup here . President Biden traveled from the U.S. Capitol across the Potomac River to Arlington National Cemetery after his inauguration ceremony Wednesday afternoon to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. He was joined by Vice President Harris as well as former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, along with their spouses and members of their families. Biden and Harris each touched the wreath, and Biden made the sign of the cross before saluting. A military bugler then played taps. The nation's 46th president arrived at the ceremony in an armored presidential limousine with the license plate reading ""46"" after driving along the security fence-lined streets of Washington, D.C. Updated at 5:40 p.m. ET As President Joe Biden took the oath of office on Jan. 20 with his history-making vice president , Kamala Harris, people across the nation seemed cautiously optimistic. Biden and Harris take office in the wake of a violent and deadly attempt by supporters of President Donald Trump to block Congress from certifying Electoral College votes on Jan. 6. In the two weeks since the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, federal law enforcement officers have made arrests and charged people from across the nation with participation in the riot. On Wednesday, as Biden told Americans that democracy had prevailed and called for a day of renewal and resolve, people across the country talked about a return to normalcy. ""I'm happy if he can do his agenda,"" Kay, a 57-year-old Trump supporter told KCUR reporter Frank Morris. ""I mean, he seems like he's a level-headed guy, and I hope that's the truth. I hope that that's what he follows. Cause then America would be better, but I'm worried that it's gonna swing too far left."" Kay, who lives in the suburbs of Kansas City, Mo., and declined to share her last name, said she hoped that the Biden administration would reunite Americans. ""That's all I want. I want America first,"" she said. ""I just want our country back to normal."" Sherry Webster, a 71-year-old from Kansas City, Mo., told Morris she thought the United States had turned a corner, but there was still a lot of work needed to bring the country together. ""We've got a steep road ahead, a really steep road ahead, but I think Biden through all his tragedy in his life, has gained a lot of wisdom,"" Webster said. ""I think he's somebody that can reach out to both sides and it really speaks to people. So I think we're headed in a good direction."" New York City was quiet during the inauguration Wednesday. Outside Trump Tower, where so many demonstrations have been held over the past four years, there were notably few people. One couple stopped by with their signs and hats from the first Women's March in 2017. ""It wasn't even a conscious feeling I woke up feeling energized. I feel the relief of not having to monitor second by second terrible decisions,"" 53-year-old Wendy Brandes told WNYC's Stephen Nessen. Nearby, 21-year-old Diana Hernandez who works in Times Square said that during Trump's term, tourists often felt emboldened to yell anti-immigrant slurs at her. She hopes that era is over now. ""I feel better ... knowing that there's a better president and a female co-president in the White House,"" Hernandez said. ""I have a good feeling for the future and the generation to come, because it shows that we have more opportunities for women."" Even some Trump supporters in the city said they would give Biden a chance to show what he can do to improve the country. Reaction to the inauguration was also muted in more conservative parts of the country. Jason Smith stood in line at a DMV in rural Southwest Idaho as Biden was sworn in. Not that he would have probably watched the new president's address anyway. More than 60 court cases challenging the election results in swing states were thrown out because the Trump campaign couldn't provide evidence of widespread fraud, but Smith doesn't think Biden was fairly elected. ""We just want to be left alone in this country,"" Smith told NPR's Kirk Siegler. ""Trump was our president, and for most of us, he still is our president. We still follow him."" Matt Gnojek of Denver usually wears his Capt. America outfit when he travels the country to raise money for pediatric cancer. But he was outside the Colorado State Capitol on Wednesday urging Americans to come together and believe in democracy. ""I just decided that a little more love, a little more smiles might be useful to more than just the kids, but maybe to some of the adults out there facing hardship as well,"" he told reporter Bente Birkeland of Colorado Public Radio. Gnojek thinks democracy is thriving rather than failing. ""But we have to trust it. You have to trust each other,"" he said. ""The claims of widespread voter fraud, it's a big beast to tackle. But if I had to venture a guess, I would say that the reason that they feel the way that they do about voter fraud is because their love for country, their love for each other was in fact  manipulated by forces that wanted to see us divided."" Outside the state Capitol building in Harrisburg, Pa., one Trump supporter seemed ready to let go of the false claims of election fraud. ""It's over. There is nothing they can do about it. It is what it is. I accept that,"" Ryan Stevenson of Carlisle, Pa., told WITF's Sam Dunklau. ""I am not interested in finding out what the facts were, the truth was. It doesn't matter to me. It's over."" For Matt Conberry, a Biden supporter from Wallingford, Pa., moving on sounds like a good idea. ""It's a very simple message. A lot of this country thinks the election might have been stolen. Or that democracy doesn't work,"" he said. ""You know, it's the best we got. You know what I mean? If you don't trust the results of the election, I don't know what else we will do as a country."" President Biden plans to extend a nationwide pause on evictions through the end of March. The federal eviction moratorium, implemented through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is intended to help tenants who have been battered economically by the pandemic. ""Without this action by President Joe Biden, millions of renters could have lost their homes during this surge in COVID-19,"" says Diane Yentel,  president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. But, she adds, the moratorium itself is insufficient and allows some landlords to evict tenants despite the protections. For example, she notes that no federal agency is enforcing the order's penalties for unlawful evictions. NPR has reported on families getting evicted despite the CDC order, which, in spirit, directs landlords not to put people out in the street for nonpayment of rent and into living situations where they can catch and spread the coronavirus. Already, one study has attributed thousands of deaths in the U.S. to evictions during the pandemic because displaced families have been forced into more crowded living conditions. Housing advocates say the CDC order is not an automatic eviction ban. Many renters don't know how to take advantage of it. Tenants must sign a CDC declaration and provide it to landlords and, in some cases, to local housing courts. The recent COVID-19 relief bill passed by Congress provides billions of dollars to pay landlords for back rent and future rent payments as millions of Americans remain unemployed and struggling to pay their bills. The hope is that too will prevent evictions since landlords only get compensated if tenants remain in place on the property. Biden is also expected to extend deadlines for moratoriums aimed at protecting homeowners from foreclosure. Updated Jan. 21 at 3:10 p.m. ET Following President Biden's executive action signed Wednesday, the Education Department extended pandemic relief for about 41 million federal student loan borrowers through Sept. 30. ""Too many Americans are struggling to pay for basic necessities and to provide for their families,"" the Education Department said in a statement. ""They should not be forced to choose between paying their student loans and putting food on the table."" In March 2020, borrowers were granted a reprieve on their loan payments — interest was set to 0% and collections of defaulted federal student loans were paused. Congress initiated this relief in the CARES Act. Both President Donald Trump and, later, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, extended it. Before Biden's executive action, the relief was set to expire on Jan. 31. The back and forth on deadlines has been a challenge for borrowers. Research from the Pew Charitable Trusts conducted in August and September found that, among borrowers who said the relief applied to them, about 40% did not know when their loan payments were set to resume. That research also found that borrowers are struggling financially due to the pandemic: Almost 6 in 10 borrowers with paused payments reported to Pew that it would be difficult to begin making their payments if they had to do so in the next month. With the extension for the next eight months, borrowers and loan servicers now have a longer runway to prepare for when repayment starts. ""The extension of the payment pauses provides much needed relief to borrowers during the pandemic in the short-term,"" says Sarah Sattelmeyer, director of the Pew Charitable Trust's Student Borrower Success project. The big question now is what happens next. Many hope that temporary pandemic relief for borrowers will open the door to more permanent loan forgiveness. But it's unclear to what extent the Biden administration would do that. On Jan. 8, David Kamin, the incoming deputy director of Biden's National Economic Council, repeated Biden's support of Congress canceling up to $10,000 in federal student loans per borrower in response to the pandemic. But many Democrats want him to go further. In September, Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer unveiled a plan calling for the next president to cancel up to $50,000 of outstanding federal student loans per borrower. Biden has yet to signal interest in this plan. In his campaign proposal, he outlined a number of changes to paying back loans, including canceling $10,000 in debt for students who work in national or community service. As part of his ambitious plan to address climate change, President Biden is revoking a key cross-border presidential permit needed to finish the controversial Keystone XL pipeline This likely means the end of the $8 billion pipeline, a years-long project that would have carried oil sands crude from Alberta, Canada, to the American Gulf Coast. The pipeline has come to signify the debate over whether fossil fuels should be left in the ground in order to rein in greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the worst damage from climate change. President Barack Obama rejected the project in 2015. President Donald Trump revived it as one of his first actions in office. Construction on Keystone XL began last year , and the company says about 300 miles of the pipeline has been built so far. TC Energy says in a statement that ""advancement of the project will be suspended"" and that the company likely will take a hit to its first quarter earnings. While the company's announcement was straightforward, oil industry groups that supported the project decried the Biden decision. ""Killing 10,000 jobs and taking $2.2 billion in payroll out of workers' pockets is not what Americans need or want right now,"" said Andy Black, president and CEO of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines. Those jobs were temporary construction jobs and included workers from an Oklahoma union being sued by its Black members for discrimination. Environmentalists opposed the pipeline because of the oil sands crude it would have carried. Producing that oil requires extra processing that emits more of the greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. Those groups praised Biden's decision along with his vow to rejoin the Paris climate agreement after Trump withdrew. ""It makes the United States once more part of the global climate solution — not the problem,"" responded Mitchell Bernard, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the pipeline was a key priority for him. The province of Alberta, which is an investor in the project, has said it will work with the company to pursue legal remedies."
npr|"There's widespread agreement that it's important to help older adults and people with disabilities remain independent as long as possible. But are we prepared to do what's necessary, as a nation, to make this possible? That's the challenge President Biden has put forward with his bold proposal to spend $400 billion over eight years on home and community-based services — a major part of his $2 trillion infrastructure plan. It's a ""historic and profound"" opportunity to build a stronger framework of services surrounding vulnerable people who need considerable ongoing assistance, says Ai-jen Poo , director of Caring Across Generations, a national group advocating for older adults, individuals with disabilities, families and caregivers. It comes as the coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc in nursing homes, assisted living facilities and group homes, killing more than 174,000 people , by some estimates, and triggering awareness of the need for more long-term care options. ""There's a much greater understanding now that it is not a good thing to be stuck in long-term care institutions"" and that community-based care is an ""essential alternative, which the vast majority of people would prefer,"" says Ari Ne'eman , a doctoral student in health policy at Harvard University, and  senior research associate at Harvard Law School's Project on Disability. ""The systems we do have are crumbling"" due to underfunding and understaffing, and ""there has never been a greater opportunity for change than now,"" saids Katie Smith Sloan , president of LeadingAge, at a recent press conference where the president's proposal was discussed. LeadingAge is a national association of more than 5,000 nonprofit nursing homes, assisted living centers, senior living communities and home care providers. But prospects for the president's proposal are uncertain. Republicans decry its cost and argue that much of what the proposed American Jobs Plan contains, including the emphasis on home-based care, doesn't count as real infrastructure . ""Though this proposal is a necessary step to strengthen our long-term care system, politically it will be a challenge,"" suggests Joseph Gaugler , a professor at the University of Minnesota's School of Public Health, who studies long-term care. Even advocates of Biden's proposal acknowledge it doesn't address the full extent of care needed by the nation's rapidly growing older population. In particular, middle-income seniors won't qualify directly for programs that would be expanded. They would, however, benefit from a larger, better paid, better trained workforce of aides that help people in their homes — one of the plan's objectives. ""This plan isn't everything that's needed, not by any step of the imagination,"" Poo says. ""What we really want to get to is universal access to long-term care. But that will be a multistep process."" Understanding what's at stake is essential as communities across the country and Congress begin discussing Biden's proposal. The services in question Home and community-based services help people who need significant assistance live at home as opposed to nursing homes or group homes. Services can include home visits from nurses or occupational therapists; assistance with personal care such as eating or bathing; help from case managers; attendance at adult day centers; help with cooking, cleaning and other chores; transportation; and home repairs and modifications. It can also help pay for durable medical equipment such as wheelchairs or oxygen tanks. The need Statistics suggest that, at some point in their lives, 70% of older adults in the U.S. will require help with dressing, hygiene, moving around, managing finances, taking medications, cooking, housekeeping and other daily needs , usually for two to four years. As the nation's aging population expands to 74 million in 2030 (the year the youngest baby boomers reach age 65 ), that need will expand exponentially. Younger adults and children with conditions such as cerebral palsy, blindness or intellectual disabilities can similarly require significant assistance. The burden on families Currently, 53 million family members provide most of the care that vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities require — without being paid and often at significant financial and emotional cost. According to AARP, family caregivers on average devote about 24 hours a week to helping loved ones and spend around $7,000 out-of-pocket on that care . This reflects a sobering reality: for most individuals and families paying for long-term care services is even more expensive than providing the care themselves.. According to a survey last year by Genworth, a financial services firm, the hourly cost for a home health aide averages $24. Annually, assisted living centers charge an average $51,600, while a semiprivate room in a nursing home goes for $93,075. Medicare limitations Many people assume that Medicare — the nation's health program for 61 million older adults and people with severe disabilities — will pay for long-term care, including home-based services. But Medicare coverage is extremely limited. Medicare covers home-based health care services only for older adults and people with severe disabilities who are homebound and need skilled services from nurses and therapists. It does not pay for 24-hour care or care for personal aides or homemakers. In 2018, about 3.4 million Medicare members received home health services. In nursing homes, Medicare pays only for rehabilitation services for a maximum of 100 days. It does not provide support for long-term stays in nursing homes or assisted living facilities. Medicaid options Medicaid — the federal-state health program for 72 million children and adults in low-income households — can be an alternative, but financial eligibility standards are strict and only people with meager incomes and assets qualify. Medicaid supports two types of long-term care: home and community-based services and those provided in institutions such as nursing homes. But only care in institutions is mandated by the federal government. Home and community-based services are provided at the discretion of the states. Although all states offer home and community-based services of some kind, there's enormous variation in the types of services offered, who is served (states can set caps on enrollment) and state spending. Generally, people need to be frail enough to need nursing home care to qualify. Nationally, 57% of Medicaid's long-term care budget goes to home and community-based services — $92 billion in the 2018 federal budget year. But half of states still spend twice as much on institutional care as they do on community-based care. And 41 states have waiting lists for home and community-based health services, totaling nearly 820,000 people, with an average wait of 39 months. Based on the best information available, between 4 million and 5 million people receive Medicaid-funded home and community-based services — a fraction of those who need care. Workforce issues Biden's proposal doesn't specify how the $400 billion in additional funding would be spent, beyond stating that access to home and community-based care would be expanded and caregivers would receive ""a long-overdue raise, stronger benefits and an opportunity to organize or join a union."" Caregivers, including nursing assistants and home health and personal care aides, earn $12 an hour, on average. Most are women of color; about one-third of those working for agencies don't receive health insurance from their employers. By the end of this decade, an extra 1 million workers will be needed for home-based care — a number of experts believe will be difficult, if not impossible, to reach given poor pay and working conditions. ""We have a choice to keep these poverty-wage jobs or make them good jobs that allow people to take pride in their work while taking care of their families,"" says Poo of Caring Across Generations. Next steps Biden's plan leaves out many details. For example: What portion of funding should go to strengthening the workforce? What portion should be devoted to eliminating waiting lists? What amount should be spent on expanding services? How will inequities of the current system — for instance, the lack of accessible services in rural counties or for people with dementia — be handled? ""We want to see funding to states tied to addressing those inequities,"" says Amber Christ, directing attorney of the health team at Justice in Aging, an advocacy organization. Meanwhile, supporters of the plan suggest it could be just the opening of a major effort to shore up other parts of the safety net. ""There are huge gaps in the system for middle-income families that need to be addressed,"" notes David Certner, AARP's legislative counsel . Reforms that should be considered include tax credits for caregivers, expanding Medicare's home health benefit and removing the requirement that people receiving Medicare home health support be homebound, says Christ of Justice in Aging. ""We should be looking more broadly at potential solutions that reach people who have some resources, but not enough to pay for these long-term services as well,"" Christ says.

npr|"When President Biden unveiled his major new infrastructure plan last week, the proposal included much more than fixing crumbling bridges. And for those who wish America had a more robust passenger train network, it gave them something new: hope. Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure package has two provisions involving passenger rail: $85 billion to modernize public transit (commuter rail, buses, stations, etc.) and $80 billion to improve and expand the nation's passenger and freight rail network. ""You and your family could travel coast to coast without a single tank of gas onboard a high-speed train,"" Biden said at the plan's unveiling. But the idea isn't just nice family trips — it's to use improved rail infrastructure and service to alleviate problems such as traffic and air pollution as well as improve access to jobs. Transportation is the largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. ""The American Jobs Plan will build new rail corridors and transit lines, easing congestion, cutting pollution, slashing commute times, and opening up investment in communities that can be connected to the cities, and cities to the outskirts, where a lot of jobs are these days. It'll reduce the bottlenecks of commerce at our ports and our airports,"" Biden said. The White House said the rail investment would ""address Amtrak's repair backlog; modernize the high traffic Northeast Corridor; improve existing corridors and connect new city pairs; and enhance grant and loan programs that support passenger and freight rail safety, efficiency, and electrification."" Amtrak quickly responded with enthusiasm to Biden's plan, with a map and a vision for what an expanded U.S. rail network would look like by 2035. The proposed transformation would mean some 30 new routes, and more trips on 20 existing ones. It projects 20 million more people served than the 32 million that rode Amtrak in the 2019 fiscal year. It shows an array of potential new service lines: new rail connecting all of Texas' biggest cities and new connections across the Midwest, including between Cincinnati, Columbus, Ohio, and Cleveland. In the Southeast, new routes would  stretch from Atlanta to Chattanooga and Nashville, Tenn., Savannah, Ga., and Montgomery, Ala. There would be service to every state in the contiguous U.S. but South Dakota — a fact that drew the ire of Gov. Kristi Noem, who criticized the infrastructure package. Amtrak says better rail service means ""cleaner air, less traffic, and happier people,"" and it points to inequality that has resulted from the country's current patchy train service: ""Many of the country's biggest and fastest growing metropolitan areas, with diverse populations, don't have the rail service they deserve."" Cities such as Houston, Atlanta and Cincinnati currently have bare-bones Amtrak service, with trains that only stop once a day and often in the middle of the night. Major cities including Las Vegas, Nashville, Columbus and Phoenix don't have any Amtrak service at all. And that happiness bit? Amtrak notes that in some cities, people spend more than 80 hours a year in traffic. ""Population growth will make this much worse without better alternatives like rail,"" it warns. Around the country, local news dug into what expanded rail could mean for their communities. ""More direct train service between Raleigh and Richmond — and cities beyond. New passenger lines running to the North Carolina coast and to the state's mountains,"" Raleigh, N.C.'s The  News & Observer wrote . ""Prospects for a passenger rail line connecting Baton Rouge and New Orleans got a boost this week,"" wrote the New Orleans Advocate , noting that the last passenger train to serve Baton Rouge, La., ended service in 1969. ""Amtrak may soon have the cash to install a new rail line between Las Vegas and Los Angeles,"" the Reno Gazette-Journal said . ""President Joe Biden's infrastructure improvement plan would bring Amtrak passenger service back to Phoenix for the first time in decades,"" NPR member station KJZZ noted . And on Twitter, people started posting the rail lines they'd like to see. Like a direct route from Ohio to Florida. Before all that can happen, an infrastructure bill will need to get through Congress. The House and Senate are both working on infrastructure bills,  which are expected to include what the administration has proposed, but the process is still unclear. For those eager for alternatives to the car, the historic proposal by a president known for his former daily commute by Amtrak from home in Wilmington, Del., to D.C. is what they've been waiting for. ""President Biden's plan would revolutionize the way Americans travel, finally launching U.S. passengers into the 21st century,"" said Jim Mathews, president and CEO of the Rail Passengers Association."
npr|"Hundreds of migrant children and teens traveling without their parents have been held in jail-like detention centers at the border for 10 days, and longer, a DHS document obtained by NPR shows. Under law, minors are only allowed to spend 72 hours in the detention centers, which are run by Customs and Border Protection. But as of Thursday, more than 500 of the young migrants have spent more than 240 hours in the border facilities, according to the DHS documents. Spokespersons for CBP and DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Thursday. The Biden administration is struggling to address the rapidly growing number of unaccompanied minors arriving at the border. Biden administration officials acknowledged the challenge, but earlier on Thursday told reporters they are ""dealing with the hand they were dealt"" by the previous administration. ""The president inherited a mess, which is the result of four years and one thousand policies that had the intent of undermining and weakening the entire immigration system,"" a Biden administration official told reporters on a briefing call. As of Thursday, 4,600 minors were being held at the CBP facilities – a 30% increase in just one week, and a record for the detention centers. Officials said the administration has opened two emergency sites this week to help house the children: one in Midland, Texas; the other at a convention center in Dallas. The two sites can house 2,000 children. As of the end of February, about 29,000 unaccompanied migrant children have reached the border for the fiscal year beginning in October, the administration officials told reporters. A total of 9,562 are in the custody of Health and Human Services where they spend 34 days on average, officials said. U.S. border patrol officials encountered about 120,000 people attempting to cross the southwest U.S. border in February, a 28% increase over the previous month, Biden administration officials said. Most were turned back, but some families have been allowed to enter the country while they await consideration of asylum claims. ""So four years cannot be undone in eight weeks, but we are making progress every single day,"" an official told reporters Thursday."
npr|"As President Biden pushes to get students back in schools, there's one crucial question: How much social distance is necessary in the classroom? The answer (to that question) has huge consequences for how many students can safely fit into classrooms. Public schools in particular are finding it difficult to accommodate a full return if 6 feet of social distancing is required — a key factor behind many schools offering hybrid schedules that bring students back to the classroom just a few days a week. The CDC's current guidance for schools recommends seating or desks be ""at least 6 feet apart when feasible."" But a new study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases suggests that 3 feet may be as safe as 6 feet, so long as everyone is masked. The authors compared infection rates at Massachusetts schools that required at least 3 feet of distancing with those that required at least 6 feet, and found no significant difference in the coronavirus case rates among students or staff in the two cohorts. The authors pointed out an important caveat to the findings: It's possible that districts that allowed a minimum of 3 feet were able to attain larger distances than that in reality – and in that case, the study would be capturing official policy but not its real-world implementation. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the CDC, addressed the Massachusetts study at the White House COVID-19 briefing on Monday, and noted that schools have struggled with the 6-foot guidance. ""We are looking at these data carefully,"" Walensky said. ""The question actually prompted more studies to be done, so we know more are forthcoming. We're taking all of those data carefully and revisiting our guidances in that context."" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious diseases official and Biden's chief adviser on COVID-19, was asked about the findings on Sunday. ""When the data shows that there is an ability to be 3 feet, the CDC will act accordingly,"" Fauci told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""The CDC is very well aware that data are accumulating making it look more like 3 feet are okay under certain circumstances."" The CDC will update its guidance if the data merits it, Fauci said. The World Health Organization's school guidance suggests that in areas with community transmission of COVID-19, at least 1 meter (3.28 feet) of distance should be maintained between individuals. That's much shorter than the CDC's recommended 6 feet. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that desks be placed at least 3 feet apart, and 6 feet if possible. But it notes that in many schools, 6 feet is not possible without severely limiting the number of students. As a consequence, the APA says, ""Schools should weigh the benefits of strict adherence to a 6-feet spacing rule between students with the potential downside if remote learning is the only alternative."" Biden's new education secretary Miguel Cardona told NPR recently that one way to achieve social distancing requirements is to use parts of the school building differently. He pointed to a Connecticut school that was using its gymnasium as a classroom for part of the day, and he said warm weather allows for the possibility of outdoor classrooms. While such conversions take resources, Cardona said, ""I think it can be done, and it can be done safely."""
npr|"ROME — The second Roman Catholic president in American history is a devout man who makes no secret of the importance of faith in his life. President Joe Biden is a regular churchgoer, often quotes St. Augustine and carries a rosary that belonged to his late son Beau. In one of the first images released of him in the Oval Office, a photo was visible behind his desk showing him with Pope Francis. The Argentine-born pope and the new American president have both staked out liberal stances on issues like climate change and economic disparity, and have taken different positions from their ""culture warrior"" predecessors. Biden diametrically differs from former President Donald Trump in his support for a more inclusive society, on issues ranging from immigration and health care to LGBTQ equality. Francis has moved away from Pope John Paul II's and Benedict XVI's emphasis on sexual morality, preferring to focus on social justice and the rights of the poor and marginalized. He has repeatedly lashed out at what he describes as the destructive effects of laissez-faire capitalism on society and the environment. The pope and the president have a lot in common, says Paul Elie , a scholar of Catholicism at Georgetown University. ""Their informality, the fact that they were elected late in life, the fact that they seem to take issues as they come, listening, discerning and then acting,"" he says. ""And both of them, I think, have surprised their people by turning out to be more progressive than was expected."" In the November election, just over half of American Catholics voted against Biden, in great part because of his support for laws such as those guaranteeing abortion rights that run contrary to Church doctrine. Nevertheless, the new president has a friend — and potential ally — at the Vatican. On Inauguration Day, Pope Francis sent Biden a warm note saying, ""Grave crises facing our human family call for farsighted and united responses."" Relations between Pope Francis and Trump were at best chilly. When Trump was still a candidate in 2016, Pope Francis suggested he was ""not a Christian"" for his campaign vow to deport more immigrants and build a wall along the border with Mexico. A year later, the pope wondered how Trump could claim to be ""pro-life"" while ordering policies that broke up the families of immigrants and asylum seekers. Biden's election was welcomed by the Vatican — but without mention of his support for abortion rights, says Villanova University theology professor Massimo Faggioli . ""It's clear that they see this moment as a return to some sanity. This is what the Vatican really holds dear,"" says Faggioli, ""so that that there is a predictability in the relations between countries and leaders."" Faggioli, the author of Joe Biden and Catholicism in the United States , argues that under the influence of the previous two papacies, the U.S. Catholic Church leadership became increasingly traditionalist, ignoring any discourse on racism, rule of law or voting rights — and has thus become more closely allied with the political right. He points out that Biden and the pope share the same detractors among American Catholic leaders — the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, which he says ""is dominated by ultraconservative Catholic bishops whose political sympathies lie very clearly with the Republican Party, and not just on the abortion issue."" The Vatican was reportedly annoyed by a bishops' conference statement on Inauguration Day. Signed by the group's leader, Archbishop José H. Gomez, the statement lamented that ""our new President has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender."" It added that ""for the nation's bishops, the continued injustice of abortion remains the preeminent priority."" An unnamed senior Vatican official told the Catholic publication  America , ""It is most unfortunate and is likely to create even greater divisions within the Church in the United States."" ""So, there is an extremist wing of the Catholic Church,"" says Faggioli, ""which is a handful of bishops, but a bigger chunk of the clergy."" For example, last August, the Rev. James Altman of La Crosse, Wisc., posted a video to YouTube in which he proclaimed, ""You cannot be Catholic and be a Democrat, period. Their party platform absolutely is against everything the Catholic Church teaches. Repent of your support of that party and its platform or face the fires of hell."" It has been viewed more than a million times. Not all conservative Catholics strike such an apocalyptic tone toward Democrats. But many share a message of condemnation. In a podcast last month with the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank, George Weigel , an author and political analyst who has written extensively about the Catholic Church, said the new president seems quite sincere in his personal piety. But he went on to attack Biden, saying he ""facilitates grave moral evils. Mr. Biden is an incoherent Catholic and incoherent Catholics should not be presenting themselves for Holy Communion as if they were living in full communion with the church."" As both Francis and Biden ignore their Catholic critics, presidential historian Timothy Naftali sees potential parallels now with a period at the peak of the Cold War six decades ago. Six months after the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world to the precipice of nuclear annihilation in 1962, Pope John XXIII issued the Pacem in Terris  encyclical . Addressed not just to Catholics but to all people ""of good will,"" it called for peacemaking through negotiation. A week later, President John F. Kennedy cited the document in a major speech , and was subsequently able to win domestic support for a nuclear test ban treaty with the Soviet Union. Naftali believes the pope and Biden could join forces against climate change — the great threat facing humanity today. ""Given the prominence of Pope Francis on this issue , the fact that he has identified climate change as an existential threat,"" says Naftali, ""there is a natural partnership with a secular leader who has also identified climate change as an existential threat. These are two leaders powerful in different realms. That's an opportunity. And it's not an opportunity that comes every generation."" Naftali is convinced that amid so much disinformation on the coronavirus pandemic and vaccines, these two prominent Catholics could also work together to convince more people that science and faith are not mutually exclusive."
npr|"For President Biden, it's a $1.9 trillion gamble. If successful, his ""American Rescue Plan"" will help struggling families and businesses weather an unprecedented pandemic and provide a boost to a badly dented economy. It's also broadly popular with voters . Critics, however, worry it will be end up being a poorly targeted plan that squanders trillions in borrowed money in ways that will do little to improve the nation's long-term economic outlook. ""We are well past the point where our economy is collapsing,"" said Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., this week. ""The last thing we need is a massive multi-trillion-dollar, universal spending bill."" And it's not just Republicans who are pushing back. ""The question isn't whether we need big stimulus,"" former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told NPR's Weekend Edition this month. ""The question is, do we need the biggest stimulus in American history?"" Congress has already passed trillions in aid since last year, leaving the country's deficit at its second highest since World War II. The latest stimulus plan is comprehensive, at least under the version that House Democrats are set to pass along party lines as early as Friday. For starters, it would include direct payments of $1,400 to most Americans. It would also include extended unemployment benefits, money to help schools reopen and aid to state and local governments. Progressives also hoped to use the plan to gradually boost the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, although that effort appeared in jeopardy after an adverse decision from the Senate parliamentarian Thursday night. Summers, who served in different positions in the Clinton and Obama administrations, has warned that deficit-financed spending now on a short-term relief package could make it harder for the Biden administration to find money later for long-term investments in things like infrastructure. He's also concerned that with consumer spending already on the rise, a surge in new federal spending could overwhelm businesses, triggering something the U.S. hasn't seen in a long time: inflation. ""We need to make sure we're concerned with not overheating the economy,"" Summers said. Senior administration officials, however, are pushing back, saying millions of Americans still need the help badly. ""I've spent many years studying inflation and worrying about inflation. And I can tell you we have the tools to deal with that risk if it materializes,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, a former Federal Reserve chair, told CNN this month. ""But we face a huge economic challenge here and tremendous suffering in the country,"" she added. ""We've got to address that. That's the biggest risk."" Biden has shown no signs of retreating from his plan. On Monday, he took his critics head-on. ""Critics say the plan is too big,"" Biden said. ""Let me ask them a rhetorical question: What would you have me cut?"" Plenty, according to critics of the plan. Here are key elements of Biden's plan, and why some are pushing back. $1,400 relief payments  Biden's plan would send $1,400 payments to most Americans. That's in addition to the $600 payments that already went out this year and the $1,200 that went out to most Americans earlier in 2020. For lower-income families, who have been disproportionately hurt by the recession, the additional money could be an important lifeline. Households making less than $46,000 spent most of their $600 payments almost immediately, according to researchers at Harvard who studied credit and debit card data. But Biden's plan doesn't limit payments to lower-income families. Individuals making up to $75,000 and couples making up to $150,000 would be eligible for the full amount, while higher earners would receive less. Whether these higher-income Americans would spend those checks, delivering stimulus to the economy, is in doubt. According to the Harvard researchers, families making more than $78,000 spent little of their January payment, socking most of the money into savings. To critics, that makes the blanket federal payments to wealthier families unnecessary since many have been largely unscathed by the recession. ""The average household in America is in a better financial position today than it was before the pandemic,"" Toomey, the Pennsylvania senator, said this week. ""If there were to be further fiscal policy, it should address where the problem is and not where the problem is not."" Unemployment benefits At last count, some 19 million Americans were receiving some form of unemployment assistance. While the job market has improved since the early months of the pandemic, job gains have largely stalled in recent months. And forecasters say it could take some time before people in hard-hit service industries such as travel and live entertainment are back at work. In December, Congress approved a temporary extension of jobless benefits passed early in the pandemic, but that begins to run out in mid-March. Biden's plan would extend aid through August. It also boosts the federal government's supplemental unemployment benefit from $300 to $400 a week. Some employers have complained that robust jobless benefits discourage employees from going back to work or looking for new jobs. But researchers at the University of Chicago and the JPMorgan Chase Institute found little evidence of this . In the early months of the pandemic, when the federal government raised unemployment benefits by $600 per week, more than half the idled employees returned to work before those benefits ran out. When the extra benefits did expire last July, there was no sudden jump in people seeking new jobs. Researchers argue the supplemental benefits may have actually increased overall employment by giving jobless people more money to spend, which in turn helped pay the wages of other workers. Aid to Cities and States Biden's proposal includes $350 billion to address pandemic gaps in state and local government budgets. Yet those gaps have turned out to be smaller than many people feared and some governors like Asa Hutchinson from Arkansas say their states don't need the aid. ""On average, state revenue has mostly recovered. And the key reason for that is that income has mostly recovered,"" said Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""The economy is doing much better right now than we thought it was going to be doing early in the pandemic."" Because upper-income workers, who pay the lion's share of state taxes, have generally managed to keep working, the pandemic drain on state revenues has been muted. JPMorgan estimates that state revenues nationwide were only slightly lower in 2020 than the year before the pandemic. But that's not every state. Those that rely heavily on tourism and oil drilling have been hit much harder. ""States like Nevada and Hawaii and Alaska and Texas are not doing very well,"" Goldwein said. ""States like California have a $25 billion surplus. Idaho has had the fastest revenue growth it's seen in years.  So there really are big differences between the states."" Those differences don't fall neatly along party lines, even though congressional Republicans have resisted state and local aid as a ""blue state bailout."" ""The pandemic isn't partisan,"" said Michael Leachman of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The budgets of some blue states like California have fared better than those in red states like North Dakota, where revenues fell nearly 10% last year, according to JPMorgan. State and local governments have cut nearly 1.3 million jobs in the past year — nearly twice as many as during the last recession. ""After the last recession, we made a big mistake. The federal government provided some aid to states and localities, but it was far too little and it ended much too soon and the effect of that was to really slow the economy's recovery,"" Leachman said. ""We would be much better off to make sure that we're not making the same mistake again. $15 minimum wage One of the most controversial aspects of the original Biden package was its push to gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025. That's more than twice the current federal minimum of $7.25 an hour, which hasn't budged since 2009. (Had the minimum wage simply kept pace with inflation, it would be about $9 an hour today.) The minimum wage provision ran into a procedural roadblock Thursday when the Senate parliamentarian said it could not be included in a budget bill under the special rules Senate Democrats are using to sidestep a GOP filibuster. Progressives vowed to pursue a wage hike through other means, but that effort faces long odds given political opposition from Senate Republicans and some moderate Democrats. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the parliamentarian's decision disappointing. ""House Democrats believe that the minimum wage hike is necessary. Therefore, this provision will remain in the American Rescue Plan"" when the House takes the bill up Friday, Pelosi said in a statement. Forecasters from the Congressional Budget Office say boosting the minimum wage to $15 an hour would deliver a pay raise to as many as 27 million Americans. But they caution it would also cost as many as 1.4 million jobs. Economists have long theorized raising pay for low-wage workers would come with trade-offs — including higher prices for consumers and a shift to automation. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell declined to take a position on the proposed wage hike this week — calling it a classic policy choice for lawmakers — but he did say research suggests the effects are more nuanced than was once believed. Although the federal minimum wage hasn't changed in more than a decade, many cities and states have already adopted higher minimums. Florida voters , for example, decided in November to boost that state's minimum to $15 an hour by 2026."
npr|"In early December, Dr. Katy Stephenson was watching TV with her family and scrolling through Twitter when she saw a tweet that made her shout. ""I said 'Oh, my God!' "" she recalls. ""Super loud. My kids jumped up. My husband looked over. He said, 'What's wrong, what's wrong, is everything OK?' I was like, 'No, no, it's the opposite. It's amazing. This is amazing !' "" Dr. Rochelle Walensky had just been tapped to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Stephenson is an infectious disease specialist and vaccine scientist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. So the news had special meaning for her and the many jubilant colleagues tweeting their joy. They'd all been helping each other  through the brutal pandemic year, she says, but feeling like they got little to no help from the federal government. ""It was so baffling,"" she says. ""It wasn't even just that we didn't know what the government was doing. It was that sometimes it felt like sabotage. Like the federal government was actively trying to mess things up."" But through it all, as the long months became a year, Walensky had been out front, Stephenson says, sticking to the science and telling the truth. And from the moment Walensky stepped up to lead the CDC, she has promised to keep telling the truth. Even when it's bad news. Walensky told the medical journal JAMA last month that she'll welcome straight talk from the scientists at the CDC as well. ""They have been diminished,"" she said. ""I think they've been muzzled — that science hasn't been heard. This top tier agency, world-renowned, hasn't really been appreciated over the last four years and really markedly over the last year or so. I have to fix that."" Now 51 years old, Walensky has long been a doctor on a mission — first, to fight AIDS around the world, and now, to shore up the CDC and get the United States through the pandemic. Beyond unmuzzling her agency's staff, she vows to tackle many other challenges, pushing particularly hard on the vaccine rollout and rebuilding the public health system. Walensky's family has a tradition of service, including a grandfather who served in World War II and rose to be a brigadier general. And she likens the call she got from the Biden administration to a hospital alarm that goes off when a patient is in cardiac arrest. ""I got called during a code,"" she says. ""And when you get called during a code, your job is to be there to help."" At Massachusetts General Hospital, where Walensky was the chief of infectious diseases, some of her many admirers now have T-shirts that read ""Answer the Code"" with her initials, RPW, beneath. The shirts are part of an outpouring of affection in Boston biomedical circles and far beyond that greeted Walensky's appointment — including a flood of  floral bouquets that her husband and three sons helped answer the door to accept after word of her new job got out. ""At one point, one of my sons said, 'You know, Dad, we should just open a florist shop at this point,"" says Rochelle Walensky's husband, Dr. Loren Walensky . He studies and treats children's blood cancers at Boston Children's Hospital and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. And now he could be called the ""first gentleman"" of the CDC. He calls Rochelle his ""Wonder Woman"" and still remembers when he first saw her 30 years ago, in the cafeteria of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where they were both students. ""She stood out,"" he says. ""And one of the reasons why she stood out is because she stands tall. Rochelle is 6 feet tall."" She also had extraordinary energy and discipline, even then, he remembers: ""Most of us would roll out of bed and stumble into the lecture hall as our first activity of the day, and for Rochelle, she was already up and running and bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for hours before any of us ever saw the light of day."" After medical school, Rochelle Walensky trained in a hospital medical unit so tough it was compared to the Marines. It was the mid-'90s, and the AIDS epidemic was still raging. She saw many people die. And then, a few years later, she saw the advent of HIV treatments that could save patients — if those patients could get access to testing and care. Loren Walensky recalls coming home one day to find her sitting at the kitchen table working on extremely complex math. She was starting to broaden her focus from patient care to bigger-picture questions about the increased equity in health care that more funding and optimal treatment choices could bring. ""And it was like a switch went off,"" he says, ""and she just had this natural gift for this style of testing — whether if you did X, would Y happen, and if you did X with a little more money, then how would that affect Y? And all of these if-thens."" She started doing more research, including studies of ways to get more patients tested and treated for AIDS, even in the poorest countries. One of her most prominent papers calculated that HIV drugs had given American patients at least 3 million more years of life. She worked with Dr. Ken Freedberg , a leading expert on how money is best spent in medicine. ""You can't do everything,"" Freedberg says, ""and even if you could, you can't do everything at once. So what Rochelle is particularly good at is understanding data about treatments and public health and costs, and putting those three sets of data together to understand, 'Well, what do we do? And what do we do now ?' "" So, if Walensky had a Wonder Woman superpower, it was using data to inform decisions and save lives. That analytic skill has come in handy over the past year, as she has helped lead the pandemic response for her Boston hospital and for the state of Massachusetts. She has weighed in often — and publicly — about coronavirus policy and medicine, speaking to journalists with a natural candor that's contrasted with the stiffer style of some federal officials. Back in April, when a huge surge of COVID-19 cases hit, she didn't deny the pain. ""We are experiencing incredibly sad days,"" she said in an interview in the spring. ""But we sort of face every day with the hope and the vision that what we will be faced with, we can tackle."" And in November, she offered a sobering reality check from the front lines about current COVID-19 medical treatments: ""When I think about the armamentarium of true drugs that we have that benefit people with this disease, it's pretty sparse,"" she said. Walensky kept publishing research on key pandemic topics, such as college testing and antibody treatments. And she weighed in often publicly — on Twitter, in newspapers, and on radio and TV. Asked on CNN whether the Biden plan to get 100 million Americans vaccinated in 100 days could restore a sense of normalcy, she responded with characteristic bluntness — a quality that could cause trouble in these polarized times.  ""I told you I'd tell you the truth,"" she said. ""I don't think we're going to feel it then. I think we're still going to have, after we vaccinate 100 million Americans, we're going to have 200 million more that we're going to need to vaccinate."" Walensky is facing a historic challenge, and leading an agency where she's never worked. Already, she's fielded blowback for the new CDC guidance on when and how schools should reopen , and she's openly worried about new, more transmissible variants spreading nationwide. Still, Boston colleagues say they have no doubt she'll succeed in making the transition from leading an infectious diseases division of 300 staffers to a public health agency of about 13,000. ""I would lie down in traffic for her,"" says Elizabeth Barks , the infectious disease division's administrative director at Mass General. ""And I think our entire division would lie down in traffic for her."" Leading and rebuilding the CDC in the midst of a pandemic will be difficult. But Barks and others who know Walensky well say she's clear-eyed and ready to dig in to meet the challenge; she'll try a new approach if first attempts fall short. Walensky brought a plaque from her desk in Boston to CDC headquarters in Atlanta. It reads: ""Hard things are hard."""
npr|"Christian nationalism has effectively spread so much disinformation that three in five white evangelicals say Biden was not legitimately elected, according to the American Enterprise Institute. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: At Patriot Church in Knoxville, Tenn., God always comes first, but country is a close second. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KEN PETERS: Praise the Lord. So good to have all you patriots in the house. MARTIN: This is Pastor Ken Peters. He and his family moved to Knoxville six months ago from Spokane, Wash., to start this church. His wife and kids help lead the music. Video and audio from weekly sermons are posted on the church's Facebook page. The service on January 10, the first Sunday after the deadly U.S. Capitol riot, began this way. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: We're going to start out with an old song. Maybe you know it. It's called ""Onward, Christian Soldiers,"" and it's very fitting for the time that we're going through right now. So if you would like to sing - (singing) onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war... MARTIN: They meet in a small, wooden cabin. There's a big American flag hanging on the wall that looks to be crocheted by hand. Video shows people milling around before the sermon starts, the vast majority of them white. Young and old, they greet each other with hugs and smiles. No one is wearing a mask. The church is clear on what it's against - abortion, same-sex marriage and, quote, ""leftism."" After the election, there is a new sense of urgency about all of it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PETERS: Do I have any soldiers in the house this morning? (APPLAUSE) PETERS: If you're not a soldier, hang out here. You'll end up a soldier. MARTIN: Moments later, another pastor, Shahram Hadian, gave the sermon. Peters and Hadian traveled to Washington, D.C., for the January 6 rally with former President Trump. On January 10, this is how they characterized President Biden's win. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SHAHRAM HADIAN: The greatest coup in modern history. So when you understand what's at stake, you understand that you must act and put the fear of God in those who are committing the coup. MARTIN: Again, that's not true. It's not based on any fact or evidence. And we're not playing it to elevate some kind of fringe element within white, evangelical Christianity because in this way, the Patriot Church is not on the fringe. A new survey by the conservative American Enterprise Institute shows that roughly 3 in 5 white evangelicals say Joe Biden was not legitimately elected. (SOUNDBITE OF BADBADNOTGOOD'S ""HEDRON"") MARTIN: This morning, we're looking at how some conservative white evangelical churches have incubated and spread conspiracy theories that have led to violence. There's a name for this movement - Christian nationalism. I talked to Andrew Whitehead about it. He spent several years researching Christian nationalism, and he defines it this way - as the belief that America is a Christian nation, one that should privilege white, native-born, politically conservative Christians. ANDREW WHITEHEAD: We do find evidence that Americans who embrace Christian nationalism are much more likely to embrace conspiratorial thinking. The leaders of those movements have continually cast doubt on who you can really trust or even the federal government. MARTIN: So the distrust was already there. Then Donald Trump came along and made himself a champion for white evangelical social issues, abortion being top of the list. He won their confidence, then exploited their distrust of the establishment for his own political survival, as illustrated by a conversation that I had myself with Pastor Ken Peters of Patriot Church. PETERS: I definitely think the election outcome happened because of the deep state. I think this was a unbelievably planned-out and collaborated operation. MARTIN: Conspiracy theories like this one have also been circulating around the congregation at Spotswood Baptist Church in Fredericksburg, Va. This is a conservative church against abortion and same-sex marriage, but the words country and America aren't anywhere on its declaration of beliefs, unlike the Patriot Church. But the whispers of conspiracy theories in this congregation pushed Jared Stacy away. Up until three months ago, he was one of the pastors at Spotswood Baptist. During the protest last summer after George Floyd's killing, Stacy noticed members of his congregation making a disturbing turn towards a conspiracy theory about child sex trafficking. JARED STACY: So I began to see on social media - right? - people ignoring or pushing away Black Lives Matter by saying, you know, oh, well, no one's over here talking about trafficking. And it started out legitimate - right? - but that became a front for Q very quickly. MARTIN: By Q, Stacy means QAnon, an umbrella of conspiracy theories, chief among them the false notion that Democrats with prominent roles in business, media and government are running child trafficking rings. Remember, it was that conspiracy theory that compelled a man named Edgar Maddison Welch to fire his gun inside a family pizzeria in Washington, D.C., in December 2016. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRIAN STELTER: According to police, Welch said that he had read online that the Comet Ping Pong restaurant was harboring child sex slaves and that he wanted to see for himself if they were there. MARTIN: QAnon started to coalesce after that, amplifying false ideas about an evil liberal agenda and casting Donald Trump as their savior. Jared Stacy was afraid of what he saw taking root in his church. STACY: And so I was sitting there as a pastor saying, you know, OK, this is not just about pitting particular issues against each other anymore. This is about a wholesale view of reality, like, what is real? What is true? MARTIN: Did people you know in your own congregation, were they elevating the idea of sex trafficking of kids, even if it was overblown and being appropriated by QAnon? STACY: Yeah. Yeah. Sex trafficking, pedophilia, like, globalist or Democrat pedophilia, these are things that... MARTIN: Democrat pedophilia - so they were... STACY: Yeah. MARTIN: They'd bought in... STACY: Like, the idea that... MARTIN: ...Hook, line and sinker to that conspiracy theory. STACY: Yeah. MARTIN: Stacy told me the whole thing was dividing families. STACY: The crack, the split, Rachel, was kitchen tables, where you have two completely different information streams, one that parents use and ones that their kids use. And so the dynamic in these homes was split right along these lines. MARTIN: The older members of the church entertaining conspiracies, younger people pushing back. We reached out to Spotswood Baptist, and we asked if these kinds of conversations were happening. A member of the church leadership said, quote, ""as a church, we're not in that discussion. We have no interest being involved in that. It's not something that's been in any way discussed or on our agenda,"" end quote. But Stacy saw something different. STACY: The strain that I saw with 20 and 30-somethings and the danger - right? - was of them being given a co-opted Jesus - right? - like a Jesus who believed in Q, a Jesus who believed in deep state, a Jesus who automatically voted Republican. MARTIN: He was worried several things could happen. The younger members would leave the church altogether, or they'd buy into the conspiracy theories. Or they'd just learn to tolerate them. (SOUNDBITE OF BADBADNOTGOOD'S ""GUNSHOWERS"") MARTIN: And it's that ambivalence that can potentially be doing the most damage. Take the sex trafficking conspiracy about political leaders. I asked Ken Peters of the Patriot Church whether he thought there was anything to it. PETERS: I wouldn't disavow it because I don't know if they're right or wrong. I have no evidence, personally, to go one way or the other. MARTIN: And that's how conspiracy theories spread. What can come off as a benign plea of ignorance is enough to keep the theory going. Just the mere suggestion that, oh, well, you can't possibly know for sure, breathes new life into lies. And notice what happens next in this moment. Peters doesn't condemn the conspiracy theory, as we heard. Then he tries to diminish it by redirecting. Take a listen to the clip in its entirety, and notice the pivot. PETERS: I wouldn't disavow it because I don't know if they're right or wrong. I have no evidence, personally, to go one way or the other. I just hope that if it is happening, it stops, and let's investigate that instead of investigating preachers who were at the rally as if we started some sort of insurrection. (SOUNDBITE OF BADBADNOTGOOD'S ""HEDRON"") MARTIN: According to a recent study by Lifeway Research, 49% of Protestant pastors say they frequently hear members of their congregations repeating baseless conspiracy theories. That same study by the American Enterprise Institute we mentioned earlier, it showed that 27% of white evangelicals, the most of any religious group, believe the widely debunked QAnon conspiracy theory is completely or mostly accurate. And the big lie about the election that Donald Trump spread, the lie that led to the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, that one's not even whispered about. In Christian nationalist congregations like Patriot Church, it is shouted from the pulpit. (SOUNDBITE OF SERMON) PETERS: Biden was illegally put in as president, fake president of the United States. MARTIN: Again, researcher Andrew Whitehead. WHITEHEAD: Christian nationalism is a threat to a pluralistic democratic society because it sees particular ends like keeping a certain person in the presidency as that is what God has desired and that God wants. And so it's really difficult to ever come to the conclusion of we should share power or compromise or even abide by the democratic process because if God desired it, who are we to stand in the way of that? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Jared Stacy needed distance to figure out what was happening in the church he had spent so much time in. He moved away to Scotland with his wife and his kids. He's getting a Ph.D. in theology there. I asked him, when he thinks back to those conversations he had with his older parishioners when he tried to confront them about conspiracy theories, was he able to change anyone's mind? STACY: To my knowledge, no. My hope going in is almost like putting a pebble in someone's shoe, and eventually, man, you just got to stop walking. And you got to sit down. You have to take your shoe off, and you have to figure out, what in the world is it that is making me limp forward here? And that is what those conversations were designed to do. MARTIN: Jared Stacy eventually wants to come back to the U.S. He wants to pastor a church again, but he's going to have to figure out if planting pebbles of truth is enough to dismantle a mountain of lies.

politico|"Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) said Friday that Joe Biden needs to score a ""substantial"" win in South Carolina's Democratic presidential primary to propel his flagging campaign into the nominating contests on Super Tuesday. ""I don't know if I can tell you how big, but it needs to be substantial,"" Clyburn told CNN in an interview. ""I would like to see double digits, and not just 10 or 11. I would like to see 15 or 16,"" he said. ""That's what I want to see. I have no idea, but I feel good about our chances of getting there."" After abysmal finishes in the first three nominating states, Biden has staked the fate of his candidacy in South Carolina, where his support among the majority-black Democratic electorate has remained strong. The former vice president's White House bid received a much-needed boost Wednesday when Clyburn, the highest-ranking African American in Congress and a kingmaker of sorts in South Carolina Democratic politics, formally endorsed his campaign. Recent public polling suggests Biden is still the favorite to emerge triumphant from the first-in-the-South primary. A Monmouth University survey released Thursday showed him enjoying a 20-point lead over his nearest rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. It is crucial that Biden achieve a similarly dominant showing when South Carolina voters head to the polls this weekend, Clyburn argued, in order to prove his staying power ahead of the Super Tuesday primaries taking place three days later. ""We're trying to create a surge here. There's going to be 14 states voting on next Tuesday, and we would like to see him go into those 14 states with a big vote out of South Carolina,"" Clyburn said. ""It would signal to the people down in Texas that Joe Biden is, in fact, surging,"" he continued. ""I want to see a surge here. I'm not trying to stop anybody. I'm trying to create a surge on behalf of Joe Biden."" Biden declined Friday to describe the margin of victory he would need in South Carolina to advance to Super Tuesday, instead touting his decades-long relationship with the state and projecting optimism before the pivotal contest. ""I've been deeply involved in this community, in this state, and I feel very good about it — felt good about it from the beginning. It's been the launching pad for Barack, and I believe it'll be the launching pad for me,"" Biden told CNN. ""We'll see how many — how much I have to win by. I don't want to jinx myself along the line here,"" he said. ""I feel very good. I've worked hard to earn these votes, and I think I'll do well."" Asked to explain Biden's enduring appeal among African-American voters, NAACP President Derrick Johnson pointed directly to Clyburn's endorsement, calling the congressman a ""powerhouse in South Carolina politics, black and white,"" and a ""trusted voice"" in the state. Johnson also criticized Biden's shepherding of the 1994 crime bill that has dogged his campaign, but told MSNBC in an interview Friday that the former vice president is ""familiar with the African-American community"" in a way certain other Democratic presidential candidates are not. ""He's active in the state of Delaware. He's been a life member of the NAACP. And I don't want to say this like I'm endorsing one candidate over the other, but there is a level of familiarity with Joe Biden, and that's important,"" Johnson said. ""And some candidates, they have just stepped up recently to try to become friends to the African-American community, and the African-American voters, we're too smart for that,"" he added. ""We are looking for individuals who are more genuine than just showing up because they need a vote."""
politico|"President-elect Joe Biden and incoming first lady Jill Biden received initial injections of the coronavirus vaccine on Monday in a show of support for the inoculation. ""I""m doing this to demonstrate that people should be prepared when it""s available to take the vaccine,"" Biden said. ""There""s nothing to worry about. I""m looking forward to the second shot."" The Bidens"" vaccinations come less than a week after a  member of the press corps covering the transition and Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, the president-elect""s chosen director of the White House Office of Public Engagement, tested positive for Covid-19. Richmond""s  diagnosis is one of the closest known brushes with the deadly virus for Biden, who at 78 is at a heightened risk of complications from the disease and has gone to considerable lengths to minimize the risk of exposure during the presidential campaign and ensuing transition. ""We""re still in the thick of this,"" Biden said as cases, hospitalizations and deaths continue to mount across the country. ""There""s millions of people out there that are going to need this."" The Bidens received shots manufactured by Pfizer, one of two immunizations granted emergency authorization by the Food and Drug Administration earlier this month. The two join Vice President Mike Pence among the list of political leaders who have received shots in recent days. Pence and his wife, Karen, got vaccinated during a televised event on Friday morning alongside Surgeon General Jerome Adams, with the vice president promising to the country that ""hope is on the way."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also received shots from the Capitol""s attending physician on Friday. Noticeably absent from that list: President Donald Trump. The White House has been circumspect about when the president — who tested positive for Covid-19 at the beginning of October and was subsequently hospitalized — would get vaccinated or whether he would do so in public,  despite urging from the head of the Trump administration""s signature vaccine development operation and others. Trump also  nixed plans to have White House staffers be among the first to obtain access to the vaccine, preferring that shots instead be reserved for other priority groups. Other top government health officials have also had to wait for their turn to get the highly anticipated vaccine. POLITICO  first reported earlier Monday that Anthony Fauci, the nation""s top infectious disease expert, Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins are among those scheduled to receive doses of the vaccine manufactured by Moderna at an NIH event on Tuesday. NIH had  yet to receive a single shipment of the vaccine as of Friday, despite playing a meaningful role in developing Moderna""s vaccine, which the FDA authorized for emergency use Friday night. Both use a similar mechanism to stimulate the body""s immune response, and shipments of both products have begun to go out throughout the country, where state and local governments are overseeing their individualized distribution plans for allocating their allotments at the ground level. Broadly speaking, the first batch is being reserved for frontline health care workers and people in some of the highest-risk groups, though there has been some consternation about politicians and certain nonmedical health care employees receiving doses over other staffers while supplies remain scarce. Several members of Congress have confirmed receiving the first of two rounds of the shot — which are administered weeks apart — both as part of an effort to combat vaccine hesitancy and to ensure continuity of government if disaster struck the Capitol. Adams, the surgeon general, said on Monday there is ""symbolic value"" in elected leaders getting vaccinated if it bolsters support for the shots in certain groups that have been disproportionately affected by the virus""s toll. ""We need them to have the confidence to get vaccinated,"" he said on Fox News. ""It""s not the vaccines, it""s the vaccination that matters."""
politico|"After eight years as Barack Obama""s No. 2, Joe Biden knows a thing or two about what it takes to succeed as vice president. Now it""s his turn to decide on a running mate. Though Biden""s vetting process has been closely guarded by a few key aides and the contenders themselves, POLITICO""s reporting has clarified his likeliest picks. He""s expected to announce his choice between Aug. 1 and the start of the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 17. We know Biden""s bottom line: He wants a partner who shares his policy and governing priorities — who is ""simpatico"" with him, to use Biden""s well-worn shorthand. He needs his vice president to be able to take responsibility for key administration initiatives, and he has talked about wanting a person whose strengths balance his own. And Biden, who will turn 78 weeks after the November election, has said it""s critical his running mate is ready to be president from the first day.

politico|"Former Vice President Joe Biden's opposition to fully legalizing marijuana is well known, but on the campaign trail in New Hampshire this week he appeared to change his position. ""I think it is at the point where it has to be, basically, legalized,"" Biden said on Tuesday in a recording obtained by POLITICO . Marijuana legalization advocate Don Murphy of the Marijuana Policy Project approached Biden at a campaign event Tuesday and asked about the candidate's ""hawkish"" cannabis policy. In the recording, Biden restated his cannabis plan — which would decriminalize cannabis, expunge some cannabis-related records, make medical marijuana legal and create opportunities for more research — adding twice that he does not believe cannabis is ""a gateway drug."" He then said he thinks cannabis needs to be ""basically, legalized."" But Biden wouldn't be willing to legalize marijuana right away, unlike other 2020 contenders. Sen. Bernie Sanders has said he'll remove the federal ban on marijuana during his first 100 days as president. Biden, however, remained firm that he wants scientific research to support his decision, saying he is ""not prepared to legalize as long as there are serious medical people saying, ""We should determine what other side effects would occur.'"" Biden's campaign told POLITICO that in his remarks on the recording, he was simply ""restating his cannabis policy,"" which includes eliminating criminal penalties linked to marijuana, erasing marijuana-related criminal records and ""letting states set their own policies regarding legalization of recreational marijuana while further effort is made to study the effects of cannabis use."" His campaign did not respond, however, to questions about the vice president's comment that marijuana needs to be ""basically, legalized,"" leaving Biden's actual opinion unclear. Biden has a history of going off script. At a November town hall, Biden said marijuana is ""a gateway drug"" and that legalization was a mistake. He walked back the gateway drug comment just a few weeks later, and on Tuesday in New Hampshire reiterated that he does not think it is a gateway drug. And when he was vice president, a Sierra Club member said Biden had expressed his opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline during a campaign event in South Carolina in 2013 — a stance that soon turned up in environmentalists' ads against the project, at a time when the Obama administration's official stance was that it was still studying the pipeline. President Barack Obama eventually rejected the project in 2015. Biden has been criticized on the campaign trail for his approach to marijuana policy, including his longstanding support for stiff criminal penalties as a senator. Support for legalization has become almost a consensus stance among Democratic presidential candidates, and roughly three-quarters of Democrats back that position. That reflects shifting sentiments nationwide, with 33 states legalizing medical or recreational marijuana markets, including in some of the most conservative states in the country. This change in view, though, mimics that of other politicians who have ""evolved"" on the position of marijuana legalization. In November, Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) — one of two Republicans to vote to advance the MORE Act, which would change the federal ban on marijuana, through the House Judiciary Committee — told POLITICO ""I'm no fan of marijuana, but the laws have created more problems than they solve."" And Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.), who at first opposed marijuana legalization, said he changed his mind after realizing the disconnect between state and federal law was ""not just a Catch-22 but almost — I can't say wholly unworkable — but incomprehensible."" Whether Biden's position has officially changed, his statement was perceived that way in the moment. ""I encourage you to talk about that a little on the debate stage,"" Murphy told Biden at the end of the recording. ""There's this conflict that needs to be fixed and you get a chance to do it.""

politico|"The most prominent appointment President-elect Joe Biden has made for his new White House team is Chief of Staff Ron Klain — a long-time Biden adviser who went to Harvard Law School and won a prestigious Supreme Court clerkship. The most prominent appointment he has made so far to his cabinet is Secretary of State-designate Antony Blinken — a long-time Biden adviser who went to Harvard as an undergraduate and then moved through decades of prestigious posts in the Washington foreign policy establishment. Wait , you may wonder about this apparent Harvard focus, where is the diversity?! Not to worry. The choice to lead the National Security Council, Jake Sullivan, is a previous Biden adviser who went to Yale, before winning a Rhodes scholarship. And there is still lots of speculation about a likely spot for Bruce Reed, a veteran Biden aide who went to Princeton, before winning a Rhodes scholarship. His choice for Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, is not a long-time Biden adviser but is someone he has known for years. She went to Brown and Yale. The opening days of the transition have highlighted something that has been clear for years to anyone following Biden""s personnel preferences: He tends to have crushes on a couple of well-defined types. One of those types is the Washington professional with impeccable credentials from elite institutions. Biden will be the first president since Ronald Reagan not to possess an Ivy League degree at either the undergraduate or graduate level. People who have worked around Biden describe how he sometimes displays an acute awareness of colleagues"" academic bona-fides, and occasional sensitivity about his own. This suggests a parallel with a predecessor who was known for keen awareness of who went where. ""My Harvards,"" is what Lyndon B. Johnson called his considerable roster of academic standouts, many of whom he inherited from John F. Kennedy. This group was epitomized by national security adviser McGeorge Bundy, who was both a graduate and dean at Harvard. The phrase, ""The Best and the Brightest,"" once invoked with genuine admiration, later was used with acid sarcasm as a book title by David Halberstam, after LBJ""s Harvards helped tug him into the Vietnam catastrophe. ""He both respects them and resents them,"" one colleague of Biden""s in the Obama White House said of his attitude toward Washington""s large class of academic elites. ""He wants their approval,"" this person said, but is quick to injury if he perceives condescension. Biden graduated from the University of Delaware with a shoulder-shrug transcript full of Cs. In 1987, as his first presidential campaign was struggling to get airborne, there was a fuss over Biden""s claim that he graduated from Syracuse University Law School ""in the top half of my class."" In fact, he was near the bottom. But this has for decades been part of a Biden paradox. For years he labored under a reputation for modest intellect, and as recently as this campaign he endured taunts on that theme from President Donald Trump. But, stretching back decades, he has shown an enduring ability to recruit — and, just as importantly, retain — succeeding generations of staff members with glittering smart-kid credentials. Part of the reason, say veterans of Biden""s Senate and vice presidential operations, is that he was always more conversant in and determined to have impact on first-tier policy issues than his public reputation suggested. He showed respect to ambitious young people and gave them the influence they craved. Klain worked with Biden as chief counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee in his late twenties. But these people typically also gave Biden, who himself arrived in the Senate at an uncommonly young age, something he craved: A sense of comfort that Washington""s most capable people were fighting for him. This connection also applies to a second type of Biden favorites. They may have arrived in Washington without head-turning academic credentials, but they quickly excelled as skilled political operators with an extra measure of hustle. Among those now headed to the White House with Biden as counselor is Steve Ricchetti, who began his career as Washington operative right out of Miami of Ohio in the early 1980s and has been deputy chief of staff in Bill Clinton""s White House and chief of staff to Vice President Biden in the Obama administration. Also going in with Biden as White House senior adviser is veteran political operative Mike Donilon, who has been with him for years. So has Donilon""s sister-in-law, Cathy Russell, who will now run the White House personnel office. Her husband is Tom Donilon, who began in Washington as a young aide to Jimmy Carter and then became Obama""s National Security Adviser. Even as only a fraction of positions in the Biden administration are filled it is already obvious his team has some defining signatures. After years in which Trump and allies denounced a sinister ""Deep State"" buried in the executive branch, and many senior jobs went to people with scant credentials other than loyalty to him, the people getting Biden""s top jobs for the most part have been immersed in government and Washington culture for decades — just like their boss. For all the attention to the various ideological messages Biden may be sending with appointments, as he tries to hold together a Democratic coalition of jostling factions, what he is assembling is not so much a team of rivals as a team of careerists. A contender for Secretary of Defense is Michele Flournoy, who has been in national security circles for decades. She started a public affairs firm with Blinken, and graduated from Harvard a couple years before him. Perhaps the closest equivalent is George H.W. Bush, who relied on decades-old relationships in Washington to fill his administration. The next four successors —Clinton, George W. Bush, Obama, and Trump — all arrived from outside Washington or after a very short tenure here, and had to integrate personal loyalists into the Washington firmament. In Biden""s case, these two groups are exactly the same. What""s also notable is how much endurance his team has shown. In most cases they started their Washington careers as prodigies, with impressive jobs at young ages. Now, most are deep into middle age, toiling for a boss who is well past it, as they finally grasp top prizes. Klain, who served as chief of staff to Vice President Al Gore before holding the same job for Biden, could plausibly have been a White House chief of staff at age 39 if Gore had won the 2000 election. As it happened, Klain got portrayed by actor Kevin Spacey in the movie ""Recount,"" but he didn""t get the job he wanted until two decades later. James P. Rubin, who was a top deputy to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in the 1990s but was a foreign policy advisor to Biden on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee a decade before that, says there is an important lesson in this endurance. Biden commands long-term loyalty in a way that many politicians do not. ""When you work for him he gives you enormous strength — he trusts you to run with the ball and he protects you when you fumble,"" Rubin said. ""He gives you great confidence that he would be there for you if you were fighting for him."" It is a pattern that began in his Senate days: ""He wanted the best people, he attracted them, he gave them a long leash, and he was at the center of important things."""
politico|"President-elect Joe Biden went on a rampage early this morning, lashing out at critics within his own party who say his appointments so far lack ideological and demographic diversity and hinting that lawmakers who cross him can expect retribution once he moves into the White House on Jan. 20. Biden, an obsessive Twitter presence under normal times, went beyond his own flamboyant standards with a series of tweets that began shortly after midnight and then picked up again at 5:30 a.m. in what was apparently an effort to drive early coverage on MSNBC""s ""Morning Joe."" With his trademark alliteration, he lambasted ""loony left losers"" for their second-guessing of his transition moves and called his fellow Democrats ""pathetic"" and ""SAD!"" ""He""s out of his mind with rage,"" said one close adviser, who was granted anonymity because the person is not authorized to speak about the president-elect""s psychological state. The aide said the fury is complicating the selection of an attorney general nominee, because Biden is eager to name a choice who will use the Department of Justice""s prosecutorial powers to intimidate critics such as Sen. Bernie Sanders or Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Seems implausible, doesn""t it?  But it""s worth pondering why. For President Donald Trump, acting crazy had a rational purpose. His supporters loved it and would-be rebels in his own party were beaten into submission so thoroughly that they cheered him as lustily as supporters. Trump""s skill in enforcing obsequiousness was an important political asset. Why can""t Joe Biden create a cult of personality, too? Two ingredients are missing. One is an outsize leadership personality of the sort that the genial Biden doesn""t possess. The second, more important, is an instinct for cultlike compliance that isn""t part of the Democratic Party character or tradition. This highlights an important psychological difference between the parties. The conservative mind typically has a natural deference to authority, making Republicans more likely to respond positively to the notion of a president laying down the law and punishing dissenters. The liberal mind typically has a natural skepticism toward authority, and a natural sympathy to the grievances and demands of its own special-interest constituencies, especially when these are groups that historically have faced prejudice. This is generalizing, of course. But the generalities have enough validity that it is virtually impossible to imagine a Democratic president bullying his party the way Trump has bullied Republicans. Alas, as Biden is showing, it is not so hard to imagine the opposite phenomenon: Democrats bullying their president. During the transition, Biden has often seemed as if someone affixed a ""kick me"" sign to the back of his suit jacket. The transition, which has seen prominent Democrats openly carping about Biden""s process and several of his decisions, risks creating a dangerous dynamic for the incoming president. In the Washington context, Biden""s peril is that he is sending the message that there is not a penalty for publicly pressuring him, and is likely a benefit. In the national context, any president should wish to project a leadership vision that transcends party and clamoring constituencies. In recent days, POLITICO compiled a list of stubbed toes in the transition as Biden""s team sought to navigate conflicting demands from interest groups (""Way more chaotic than it needed to be,"" scoffed one insider), and the Washington Post documented "" frustration from liberals, civil rights leaders, and younger activists ."" The New York Times said the "" factionalism and fierce impatience "" Biden is confronting highlight his likely challenges in governing. That article included a puff of smoke to Biden""s face from Ocasio-Cortez, who said his moves do not add up to an inspiring vision: ""You have an individual appointment here, an individual appointment there. What is the overall message from the big picture in this entire Cabinet put together?"" What gives? Isn""t AOC worried she will get in trouble with her party""s leader, or, at a minimum, with his presumably less good-natured staff? No, she isn""t. No more than Sanders or Rep. Jim Clyburn, both of whom coughed and brayed to reporters about what they saw, respectively, as the cautious ideological tilt of Biden""s appointments or the insufficient racial diversity of the first wave of picks. Plenty of politicians and activists have followed their cue. No need to overstate what""s going on here. Democratic presidents often get harried in this fashion. In 1992, Bill Clinton glared and wagged his finger as he denounced ""bean counters"" for playing ""quota games and math games"" when they said his appointments reflected insufficient top jobs for women and minorities. In Biden""s case, the president-elect has grumbled privately to some fellow Democrats about being hassled by his party. But it doesn""t seem to have inhibited him from going with whom he wanted on positions that matter most to him, with longtime aides Ron Klain becoming chief of staff and Antony Blinken the nominee for secretary of State. Arguably, it projects self-confidence, not weakness, not to be hypersensitive in the way that Trump is to intramural carping. Biden""s attitude seems to be , What the hell, no big deal, that""s just Democrats doing business. But it could easily become a bigger deal than Biden wants. Substantively, Biden is hoping to pass an agenda on pandemic rescue, climate change and a dramatic expansion of government""s role in health care. He""ll do so on the back of a narrow and wobbly House majority and either a minority in the Senate or — at best, pending a special election in Georgia — a tie in the chamber that would be broken by Vice President Kamala Harris. That""s hard to do under any circumstance. It""s harder still with a fractious party in which some elements inevitably will believe Biden is not going far enough, some will fear he""s going too far, and multiple claimants will perceive their leverage is enhanced by airing their demands and grievances in public. Lyndon B. Johnson was so sensitive about leaks and the appearance of control that he sometimes reversed course on planned appointments if the news came out in advance. There wouldn""t be an appetite for that kind of enforced discipline in today""s Democratic Party. But it seems likely Biden will soon enough have to send the message something like this: The way to influence the Democratic Party is to talk to the leader of the Democratic Party. And if you want to be heard, you need to call me — not the New York Times . For now, the transition is a kind of open-air bazaar, with loud haggling at every booth. This works well for factional leaders and for journalists. Despite the grumbling, so far it seems to be doing a decent job creating an administration that broadly represents the earnestly grumpy party that coalesced — with ambivalence on multiple counts — around Biden as the best chance of dethroning Trump. But as he moves from a campaign for power to actually exercising power, Biden will soon enough need to show that just because he isn""t a bully, doesn""t mean he can be bullied."
politico|"He talked about the ""coffin ship in the Irish Sea"" in which his great-great-grandfather came to this country in the 1800s. He talked about the filibuster in part by offering up dusty pieces of his personal past. And he talked about ""a Fourth Industrial Revolution,"" inviting thoughts of the first three and of their scope and scale. On Thursday, in his long-awaited, much-anticipated initial press conference as president, Joe Biden attempted to traffic not in the twitches of news cycles but in the sweeping arcs of history, inserting everything from economic dislocation to the recalcitrant actions of Congress to the current surge of migrants at the Mexican border into the broader context of presidential and even epochal ebbs and flows. This week, so early in his Oval Office tenure, thus marked not simply another stark contrast with his predecessor—Donald Trump, equal parts history-twisting and -averse. With Biden, 78, being lampooned as decrepit by some of the noisiest voices on the right in particular following a stumble on the stairs to Air Force One, he""s actually leaning into a projection of an age-acquired wisdom to express a longer view of history. That perspective, he hopes, will imbue his ambitious agenda with an energy that could place him (if he""s successful) in a category of presidents of staggering consequence. It was true from the start on Thursday, when Zeke Miller of the Associated Press asked about immigration reform, gun control, voting rights and climate change. ""Long-term problems,"" Biden said in his response. ""They""ve been around a long time."" This on its own could""ve sounded like a cop-out. Biden endeavored to signal the opposite. He put forth himself as the person who was ""hired"" to summon his prolonged experience to try to solve intractable problems. ""The elder has the perspective of history,"" Russell Riley, the co-chair of the presidential oral history program at the University of Virginia, told me. ""The challenges that he faces are daunting, and big challenges make big moments for ambitious presidents, and I think he is visionary enough to seize the moment,"" presidential historian Mark Updegrove said. ""At the same time, it seems so anomalous given what we have experienced for four years, which in many ways felt like eight or 12 because of the rapidity of the news cycles and all of the chaos and churning of events around the Trump administration."" Trump, of course, was and is the antithesis of a student of history. He hadn""t and didn""t read biographies of presidents (and said so) even as he sought to become one. ""I don""t have much time,"" he explained. ""I never have."" During his four years in office, he propagated and commissioned (at best) facile interpretations of America""s past. The main way Trump even dabbled in presidential annals was the recurrent and self-glorifying manner in which he likened himself to Abraham Lincoln. Biden, on the other hand, sat down recently with prominent historians to tap into their expertise. Franklin Delano Roosevelt (and his New Deal) and Lyndon Baines Johnson (Great Society) could end up being the last 100 years"" closest parallels to the Biden era ""in terms of transforming the country in important ways in a short time,"" Michael Beschloss, one of the attendees, told Mike Allen of Axios. Of FDR and LBJ, the more compelling comparison might be the latter, based on conversations I""ve had recently with presidential historians. Some of the similarities: Longtime creatures of Capitol Hill. Seasoned operators more than soaring orators. And unexpected presidents—and in taxing and tumultuous times that doubled as rare apertures of opportunity. ""It""s important to learn from what worked and didn""t work in the past and gain perspective from people who study that,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters earlier this week. ""It""s meant to have an open conversation,"" she said of the meeting with historians, ""about the challenges … our country is facing and looking back at history. And it""s a moment to step back and reflect and use it as lessons moving forward."" Thursday""s 62-minute press conference in the East Room of the White House notably took place in the same space as Biden""s sit-down with the more than half-dozen high-profile historians. Reporters"" questions trended perhaps predictably toward the present. Of the 10 Biden called on, as compiled by my colleague Theodoric Meyer, half of them asked about immigration. Three asked about the filibuster. There were two more questions about the presidential campaign of 2024 (2) than there were about Covid-19 (0). (""Are reporters missing the big picture and historic nature of Biden""s agenda?"" CNN""s Brian Stelter wondered.) In any event, Biden answered the predominantly du-jour queries in practically tectonic terms, consistently conjuring not so much cycles (news or elections) as the vast patterns of centuries and generations. ""I believe we should go back to a position on the filibuster that existed just when I came to the United States Senate 120 years ago,"" he said in response to a question from Yamiche Alcindor of PBS, trying to make a joke about his age. (Biden, for the record, was elected from Delaware to the upper chamber not in 1901 but in 1972.) He got historically granular very quickly. ""From between 1917 to 1971—the filibuster existed—there was a total of 58 motions to break a filibuster the whole time. Last year alone there were five times that many. So it""s being abused in a gigantic way,"" he said. ""It used to be you had to sit there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. And guess what? People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. Filibusters broke down …"" He turned from historian to prognosticator. ""Look, I predict to you, your children or grandchildren are going to be doing their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeeded: autocracy or democracy? Because that is what is at stake—not just with China. Look around the world. We""re in the midst of a Fourth Industrial Revolution of enormous consequence. Will there be a middle class? How will people adjust to these significant changes in science and technology and the environment? How will they do that? And are democracies equipped?"" he said in response to a question from Bloomberg""s Justin Sink. ""This,"" Biden said, ""is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies."" And in response to another question about immigration, this one from Janet Rodriguez from Univision, Biden cited his own family""s genealogy and the desperation that has driven the growth of America—with an anecdote humanizing migrants and justifying the asylum process while saying at the same time that not everyone gets in and not everyone can stay even if they want to or deserve to. ""People don""t want to leave"" their homes, he said. ""When my great-grandfather got on a coffin ship in the Irish Sea""—off by a generation, he was referring to his maternal great-great-grandfather Owen Finnegan, a White House spokesperson told me—the ""expectation was: Was he going to live long enough on that ship to get to the United States of America? But they left because of what the Brits had been doing. They were in real, real trouble. They didn""t want to leave. But they had no choice."" ""He""s kind of dealt with all these issues, so naturally he understands everything isn""t fresh and everything has roots,"" said Princeton historian Julian Zelizer, nodding to Biden""s 36 years in the Senate and two terms in the White House as the vice president. ""I think there""s some comfort for a lot of Americans to be able to see someone again, even if they""re still nervous about the conditions we""re in, even if they""re not necessarily supportive of him—but someone who has some sense of that."" ""Donald Trump never could think beyond a given moment,"" added Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson. ""It""s very different."" ""The contrasts with Trump are, of course, ubiquitous,"" John Woolley, the co-director of the American Presidency Project, told me in an email. ""Part of that contrast for him is reminding us that he has a long view that is informed and not simplistic."" Biden""s only pointed departure from that long view concerned not the past but the future. Pressed by CNN""s Kaitlan Collins on whether he""ll run for reelection, Biden demurred. ""I""m a great respecter of fate,"" he said, reiterating a phrase he""s uttered many times over the course of many years. ""I""ve never been able to plan … three and a half years ahead for certain."" He capped his replies to Collins"" line of questioning with the use (three times) of a word that again was evocative of time in a much more expansive way. ""I want to change the paradigm,"" he said. ""I want to change the paradigm. We start to reward work, not just wealth. I want to change the paradigm."" The fact that FDR and LBJ are in the air here at the outset of this presidency is an unlikely twist at this stage in the life of Biden, who""s traditionally been considered more middle-of-the-road, practical more than aggressively progressive. To many historians and political analysts that I""ve talked to, it is, at least for now, a function of the moment more than the man. If nothing else, they suggest, these comparisons are premature. Biden, after all, has been president for barely more than two months. But that doesn""t mean these conversations aren""t worthy. On Thursday night, some six hours after the end of Biden""s press conference, I got on the phone with Jeffrey Engel, the founding director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. We talked about history""s disparate chapters but also their connective tissue. FDR was elected president in 1932. LBJ was elected to Congress in 1937, and was elected to the Senate in 1948, and became president, of course, on November 22, 1963, and held the office until January of 1969. And not quite four years later, Biden was elected to the Senate. ""FDR took LBJ under his wing and used to play poker with him when he was a young congressman. LBJ got into the inner circle within his first couple of years as a young congressman in D.C. FDR was his personal hero. And Biden is there at the tail end, if you will, of the broad Johnson era, or at least the effect of Johnson""s policies,"" Engel said. ""Biden comes in at the age of 30 to the Senate, and obviously has so much tragedy going on at that moment as well,"" he continued, referencing the car wreck that killed his wife and his daughter and injured his two sons, ""and every single person in the Senate wanted to mentor him—and all of them had spent time with LBJ or FDR."" It is this chronology, the dawning of the possibility of this epic, three-step lineage from the Depression to the pandemic, that underscores how Engel sees and listens to Biden right now. ""I hear it when he talks about the labor moment. When Biden talks about labor, you could close your eyes and picture a New Dealer,"" he said. ""Biden knows,"" Engel concluded, ""that there""s only two or three moments in life that actually really matter for making a structural difference. And he""s sitting in the middle of one. It doesn""t surprise me that he""s thinking about generational change."""
politico|"Joe Biden is blowing away his Democratic rivals in South Carolina, according to three new polls that show he""s the only candidate with outsize support from African-American voters in the first-in-the-South primary. While the former vice president has lost ground in surveys of overwhelmingly white Iowa and New Hampshire, Biden is pulling in about a third of the overall primary vote in South Carolina. His lead there is powered by a 44 percent backing from black voters, surveys from Quinnipiac University and the University of North Florida released Monday show. Another survey released Monday, from CBS News/YouGov , shows even stronger support from black voters in South Carolina. Biden receives more than half of his support from African-Americans and has 45 percent overall support. His next-closest opponents in South Carolina are Sen. Elizabeth Warren, at 17 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders at 15 percent in the CBS poll. In the Quinnipiac poll, Biden has 33 percent support and Warren and Sanders are at 13 and 11 percent, respectively. In the UNF survey, Biden registers 36 percent support, with Warren and Sanders tied at 10 percent. The polls bolster claims by Biden""s allies that he""s the only candidate in the race who can point to a broad base of support with a pillar of the Democratic Party – African-Americans. Their continued backing is essential to Biden""s bid — particularly in the South — since black voters could account for one-in-four total voters during primary season. High black turnout is also crucial to any Democrat""s chances  in a general election. While Biden is benefitting from his status as vice president to the first black president, his longstanding ties to South Carolina and the attacks on his character by Donald Trump have also reinforced his position, according to state Sen. Marlon Kimpson, a Democrat from North Charleston who is neutral in the race and has hosted numerous candidates in his majority-black district. ""Ironically, Trump has helped Biden here,"" Kimpson said. ""People I talk to believe Biden doesn""t get a fair shake. And there""s some ownership of him. He has been friendly to our state. He was President Obama""s vice president. There""s sort of a feeling of kinship with him,"" Kimpson said. ""And people don""t like folk picking on their relative. They believe Joe is an uncle to our state. And Trump""s preoccupation and fascination with taking him out has resonated."" Kimpson and the pollsters cautioned that the race is still fluid and anything can still happen. The surveys show that many voters have indicated they could switch their votes. There""s also a sizable pool of undecided voters, about a fifth of the state  electorate ""If Biden goes into Atlanta in the debate this week and says something stupid, well, he can""t afford any major problems,"" Kimpson said. The newest  polls are a gut-punch to the two African-American senators who have looked to the state as a springboard, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. They""ve premised their candidacies on doing well enough in Iowa, New Hampshire or Nevada in order to gain momentum and capture the support of South Carolina""s black voters -- estimated to be as much as two-thirds of the primary vote in the state. The senators"" calculus also counts on the implosion of Biden""s campaign, which has so far failed to materialize. Harris only has 3 percent overall support in South Carolina and 6 percent support from black voters there, while Booker has 2 percent support overall and from black voters in the state, according to Quinnipiac""s survey. In UNF""s poll, Harris has 4 percent overall support and also from black voters, while Booker is at 2 percent in both categories. UNF surveyed 437 Democratic voters by cell and landline phones for its poll, which has a margin of error of +/- 4.7 percentage points. Quinnipiac surveyed 768 likely voters by cell and landline phones. And CBS surveyed 933 Democrats in the state via internet-based web panels. CBS/YouGov did not provide detailed breakdowns of poll respondents by race. The polls suggest South Carolina, the final early state to vote on Feb. 29, is an uphill climb for Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who is the leader in a recent flagship poll in Iowa. In the UNF survey, Buttigieg had 3 percent support overall and 1 percent support from African-American voters. In Quinnipiac""s poll, Buttigieg registered no support among black voters and was at 6 percent overall. ""It""s certainly a warning sign for all of the other candidates,"" UNF political science professor Michael Binder said, referring to the preferences of black voters so far. Binder cautioned that early polls like this will change as the campaign grinds on and candidates win or lose in the early states. But at the moment, Biden""s support shows how strong he is with black voters. ""Biden right now is the toughest kid on the block in South Carolina and until someone comes along and punches him in the nose, he""s going to stay that way,"" Binder said. Name identification is a major asset  for Biden in South Carolina. Only 8 percent say they haven""t heard enough about him in Quinnipiac""s poll, the only to survey the leading Democratic candidates"" favorability ratings. Sanders is well-liked, too, but less so than Biden with only 9 percent saying they haven""t heard enough. The rest of the field remains largely unknown to South Carolina Democratic voters in the Quinnipiac poll, by anywhere from a fifth to half of voters surveyed. ""There""s definitely some familiarity with Joe Biden that is helping him. Voters in South Carolina know him and like him,"" said Mary Snow, a polling analyst for Quinnipiac, who added that 24 percent of voters in the primary said electability was the most important issue for them and of them, 40 percent supported Biden. The polls also show that California billionaire Tom Steyer is creeping up in South Carolina, where he has spent at least $7.5 million on TV and radio, about $1 million on Facebook and hundreds of thousands of dollars more on digital advertising and mail blanketing the state. Steyer is at 8 percent in the UNF poll, 5 percent in Quinnipiac but only 2 percent in the CBS/YouGov poll. South Carolina state Rep. Russell Ott, who endorsed Steyer, said he believes the race is ""up for grabs"" but that ""Biden is the default candidate for many."" ""I believe that Tom Steyer matches up best against Trump in terms of the economy and bringing back rural America,"" said Ott. ""I""m unfortunately very concerned that Joe Biden is going to bring more baggage in the race than he is going to need long term to be successful."" Ott also pointed out that Republicans won""t hold a 2020 primary and many in the state might cross over and vote in the Democratic race, making it potentially more unpredictable. The Quinnipiac poll brings  Steyer and entrepreneur  Andrew Yang closer to the requirements  for participating in the Dec. 19 Democratic primary debate, which is co-hosted by POLITICO and PBS Newshour. Steyer""s 5 percent in the Quinnipiac poll pushed him across the required polling threshold to participate in the debate (candidates need to get 4 percent in four polls approved by the Democratic National Committee or 6 percent in two DNC-approved polls in early states). Steyer still needs to hit a donor threshold of 200,000 unique supporters, but his campaign was confident he would hit that mark before the Dec. 12 deadline. Yang hit 4 percent in the Quinnipiac poll. This is his third qualifying poll toward the December debate and his campaign has said he has already exceeded the donor mark. The other billionaire who is expected to enter the race, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, has upside-down approval numbers, with 16 percent viewing him favorably and 26 percent unfavorably in the Quinnipiac poll. The Quinnipiac poll also reveals the long odds facing Deval Patrick, Massachusetts"" first black governor, who jumped into the race last week after opting against it months ago, robbing him of time, campaign contributions, an easy-to-assemble staff or debate appearances. ""Patrick has his work cut out for him in introducing himself to voters,"" said Snow. ""Nearly 8 in 10 likely voters say they haven't heard enough about Patrick to form an opinion of him."" In North Charleston, state Sen. Kimpson said he doesn""t understand the math for Patrick at this late date. ""Deval Patrick is an excellent candidate ... a year ago,"" Kimpson said, spelling out the ellipses as ""dot, dot, dot"" to emphasize how too much time has passed. ""I don""t know how he""s going to do it."" Zach Montellaro contributed to this report."
politico|"With help from Renuka Rayasam and Myah Ward HOW THE PRESIDENT-ELECT GETS HIS NEWS —  In the Biden administration, the foreign policy establishment is expected to return to its usual position of influence for the occupant of the Oval Office. But so is the news media establishment. Here is what Joe Biden reads and watches, according to five current and former aides: Like many other politicians, Biden gets a clips package at 9 a.m. On a busy day, it can run up to 50 pages. On a slower day, it is more in the 15- to 20-page range. Biden is not a social media obsessive, but conversations that percolate on Twitter and specific tweets are flagged to him. He also tracks moments from late-night shows that break through. ""Biden reads a lot, but doesn""t watch a lot of TV news,"" said Jay Carney, who was communications director to Biden when he was vice president. ""Can""t remember him ever watching TV in his office when I worked for him."" Still, he usually watches a good portion of MSNBC""s ""Morning Joe "" while getting ready for the day. And he will sometimes catch glimpses of TV coverage between meetings and is particularly interested in how Fox News covers him. ""It""s instructive for how a certain slice of the country is being told how to interpret what he does and what he says,"" said one longtime Biden aide. Biden watches CNN, too, and will sometimes watch some of the broadcast nightly news shows if he""s home by dinner time. But he""s mostly a newspaper guy. He gets the New York Times delivered to his house every day, so he can read it in print. He also loves to read the Delaware News-Journal and the Philadelphia Inquirer. ""He""s still in many ways Delaware""s senator,"" said the longtime Biden aide. ""He""s still very acutely focused on his local papers."" He often reads The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and the Atlantic magazine. Biden is a devoted fan of the Apple News app on his iPhone, and frequently scrolls through it when he""s in a car, on a plane or just has some down time. (Playing chess and solitaire on his phone are also favorite activities.) He has the New York Times app on his phone, and a former Biden staffer said that when he was in the White House last time, Biden had the POLITICO app and checked it regularly. He has the phone""s push notifications turned on: On the campaign trail, another Biden aide said, Biden would take meetings with his iPhone on the table in front of him and would get alerts from news apps. (The Biden aide declined to comment when asked if Biden still has his iPhone or if it""s having its security upgraded given that he""s about to become president.) Another news source is his grandchildren, who text him links about him or just ""fun stuff"" that they find online, according to the aide. Biden is apparently fluent, or at least proficient, in emoji: He has been known to react with a thumbs-up to some links texted to him. ""Big sweeping ideas"" are what most interests Biden, said the longtime Biden aide. He recalled a David Brooks column that particularly captivated Biden, titled ""The Essential John McCain"" and published in October 2017. Two months earlier, after Charlottesville, Biden had published an essay in the Atlantic titled: ""We Are Living Through a Battle for the Soul of This Nation."" ""In it, he saw a vivid description of an idea that he himself had seen and spoken to and was kind of a parallel way of talking about the battle for the soul of the nation,"" said the aide. ""It struck a chord for him, and he was just really fascinated by it."" Biden called up Brooks to talk to him about the piece and for the next year he would cite Brooks"" column in his stump speeches during the 2018 midterms. Other journalists that Biden particularly likes include Thomas Friedman, the Times columnist whom he recently gave an interview to, and Jon Meacham, the historian and commentator who has helped write a number of Biden""s speeches. Welcome to POLITICO Nightly.  Reach out at email protected and email protected , or on Twitter at @dlippman and @renurayasam .  THE UNDOING  — It could take years for Biden to deliver on his promise to reverse the Trump administration""s restrictive immigration policies, Anita Kumar and Alice Miranda Ollstein write. In total, Trump has made more than 400 alterations to immigration policy in the last four years, some since Election Day , according to the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank with staffers across the political spectrum that provides data and analysis on immigration policy. Together, the moves have reshaped virtually every part of the U.S. immigration system through executive action, policy guidance and regulatory change. Biden will be able to rescind some policies through the stroke of a pen on Day 1. But scores of others face massive hurdles. A lengthy, cumbersome regulatory process will draw out rule changes. Months of legal challenges could imperil executive orders. A recalcitrant Congress is unlikely to swiftly change laws. And a divided public and shifting border situation could create political difficulties. The result is that millions of immigrants — from those seeking to escape their countries to wealthy foreign investors — will likely remain under a lingering Trump regime for months, even years. AUSTIN TO LEARN METRO""S YELLOW LINE  —  Retired Gen. Lloyd Austin, once viewed as a long-shot candidate to be Biden""s Defense secretary, has been chosen to lead the Pentagon , according to three people with knowledge of the discussions. The decision comes two weeks after Biden announced the other senior members of his national security team, Lara Seligman , Tyler Pager and Connor O""Brien report. Michèle Flournoy, who was widely seen as Hillary Clinton""s choice to be defense secretary had she won the election in 2016, was initially viewed as the frontrunner for the job. BROTHER, IN LAW — Kamala Harris"" sister, Maya, has been jockeying to boost her husband , Tony West, in his bid for attorney general, writes Tyler. In the Obama administration, West, now chief legal officer at Uber, served as the third-highest-ranking official and ran the department""s civil rights division. But West""s relationship to Kamala Harris is likely a nonstarter for many Democrats, who have eviscerated Trump over the past four years for elevating his family to key White House positions. His work as Uber""s top lawyer, given the company""s legal troubles, have also raised concerns about his ability to fill the role. KEEP THIS ON THE KUD-LOW — Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow today applauded Biden""s nomination of Janet Yellen to lead the Treasury Department — breaking with other Trump administration officials who have not even acknowledged that Biden won the election. Kudlow offered the praise for Yellen during a live interview with The Washington Post, during which the National Economic Council director also revealed that he has started sending congratulatory notes to some early Biden appointees. WHO GETS THE GOLDEN TICKET? Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has the chance to shape California""s power structure for years to come. He not only has to appoint the person who will fill Kamala Harris"" Senate seat, but also the seat for attorney general Xavier Becerra, now tapped to be Biden""s health secretary . And then there is filling the seats of whoever gets those positions: If Newsom picks secretary of State Alex Padilla to fill Harris"" seat, for example, he has to figure out who fills Padilla""s seat. Nightly reached out to Carla Marinucci , who has been covering Newsom since the governor was San Francisco""s parking and traffic commissioner (and your Nightly host, Renuka Rayasam, was a lowly radio intern at San Francisco""s public radio station), about the jockeying in California. This conversation has been edited. What are the stakes for Newsom? This is the first time in nearly 70 years that a California governor has had anything close to this kind of appointment power. The last one was Gov. Earl Warren (who later became Supreme Court Chief Justice). Warren had to appoint a new U.S. senator, state controller and a member of the Board of Equalization, the state""s elected tax commission. His decisions are fraught with all kinds of political wrestling between interest groups. Latinos say they have never held a U.S. Senate seat in California""s 170 years, and it""s about time. So they""re pushing for Padilla to fill Kamala""s seat. He""s already been endorsed by Dianne Feinstein. But African Americans say the seat is held by an African American woman — and there""s only one in the Senate now, Kamala. So they insist that the seat has to remain with an African American woman. They""re pushing candidates like Karen Bass, Barbara Lee and even Maxine Waters (an unlikely pick, given her combative and controversial nature, I would say). And the LGBTQ community wants Mayor Robert Garcia of Long Beach, who is LGBTQ and Latino — they say their electorate has been key to the California Democratic Party in fundraising and activism and deserves a shot. Then there""s who fills Becerra""s seat. Yeah, once again, we""ve got Latinos and African Americans — two critical minority groups — jockeying for a powerful position that has been a stepping stone to the governership. We""ve heard the names of at least two African American women in law enforcement being put forth: Oakland City Attorney Barbara Parker and Contra Costa district Attorney Diana Becton. But Latinos are also putting forth names. City Attorney Dennis Herrera, who""s Latino, is considered the top contender because 1) he""s known Gavin for years; 2) was a big supporter of Kamala; 3) has helped Becerra lead the way in a number of key ""state of resistance"" lawsuits against Trump, including pushing back on his executive order to deny sanctuary cities federal funding. There are a couple of House members who might jump at it also. But we""re hearing that Nancy Pelosi wouldn""t want to give up any of these people because her margin in the House is too small, and it would be months to fill such a seat in a special election. But there""s plenty of others interested in the job too. Newsom gets to make friends — and lots of enemies — and the lobbying is already fierce Any insight into how Newsom makes these decisions? Based on his own future? Or the party""s? Or personal loyalty? It""s a little of all of those. The loyalty factor is why Padilla is so high on the list — he endorsed Gavin long before anyone, has been there for him for years and can be counted on to have his back when Newsom comes up for reelection in 2022. Do you think Newsom relishes being a kingmaker? No, he has told us this whole decision is ""vexing."" Should it be someone who reflects Harris"" profile? Should it be a ""placeholder"" (like a Jerry Brown) who won""t run again in 2022 when the seat is up? Anyone he picks will be given a huge advantage in that 2022 election as the incumbent. And California Senate seats are golden tickets. Anyone who""s appointed will have lots of power and lots of chances to rack up seniority in the U.S. Senate for decades. Welcome to Bidenology, Nightly""s look at the president-elect and what to expect in his administration. Tonight, a trip into the POLITICO Magazine archives, and some of the notable Bidenisms included in the March/April 2014 piece ""Joe Being Joe."" On ambition: ""I never had an interest in being a mayor ""cause that""s a real job. You have to produce. That""s why I was able to be a senator for 36 years."" — March 29, 2012 On the campaign trail: ""You got the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that""s a storybook, man."" — Jan. 31, 2007 On the vice presidency: ""My mother believed and my father believed that if I wanted to be president of the United States, I could be, I could be vice president!"" — May 16, 2012 On the presidency: ""I""d rather be at home making love to my wife while my children are asleep."" — June 22, 2006 ""Here I am, the first Irish-Catholic vice president in the history of the United States of America. Barack Obama is the first African American in the history of the United States of America."" — March 17, 2010 ""A man I""m proud to call my friend. A man who will be the next president of the United States — Barack America!"" — Aug. 23, 2008 HISPANIC CAUCUS VOTES ON NEW LEADER  — Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus will vote Tuesday morning on a new leader to replace outgoing Chair Joaquin Castro (D-Texas). The group is pushing for Biden to tap more Latinos to top positions in the incoming administration, writes Sabrina Rodriguez . The race is down to Reps. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) and Veronica Escobar (D-Texas) — with Ruiz considered the frontrunner as the more senior of the two lawmakers. Ruiz, a physician who has been in Congress since 2013, is pitching himself as the candidate best equipped to tackle the pandemic response. Escobar allies on the Hill say that she""s better equipped for the job because she""s been in leadership roles. Escobar served for the past year on Pelosi""s leadership team as freshman representative and was tapped by Biden for his unity task force on immigration with Sen. Bernie Sanders. Whoever wins will play a role in how Democrats shape themselves going into 2022. House Democrats are currently trying to improve their Latino outreach after witnessing Trump make inroads in the November election.  The next CHC chair will also work to help Biden push along any legislation on immigration reform. CHC member and California Rep. Linda Sánchez is currently drafting a bill that Democrats hope to drop right as Biden enters the White House. STRAIGHT TO THE TOP — Sen. Josh Hawley is unhappy that the leading coronavirus proposals do not include another round of direct payments to Americans — and he""s taking his case straight to the president , Burgess Everett writes. The Republican senator from Missouri lobbied Trump to veto any coronavirus aid bill that does not contain a second tranche of checks to Americans in a phone call on Saturday. Hawley said the president listened intently as he flew home on Air Force One from a rally in Georgia. ""I said, ""I think it""s vital that any relief include direct payments, and I""m not gonna vote for it if it doesn""t."" And I also urged him to veto any bill that did not have direct payments in it,"" Hawley said in an interview today. Hawley argues that it is ""wild"" that a Senate GOP proposal and a bipartisan $908 billion plan offers aid but doesn""t include more checks like the $1,200 payments in March""s massive CARES Act package. BIG PLAN ON CAMPUS — First semester didn""t go too well. Colleges and universities across the country are looking for a do-over in the spring. In the latest POLITICO Dispatch , education reporter Juan Perez Jr. reports on how schools are trying to beat coronavirus — and what lessons they""ve learned from the past year.

Weeks before her family turns the White House over to the Bidens, Melania Trump announced today that a new tennis pavilion on the south grounds is ready for action. The project included sprucing up an existing tennis court and children""s garden , in addition to construction of the pavilion, which replaces a smaller structure. The first lady""s office said the pavilion""s design was inspired by the architecture of the White House, especially the East and West Wings. A colonnade, parapet wall and fanlight windows tie the new building to the look and feel of the White House. Planning for the project began in early 2018, followed by approval in June 2019 by the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission. Melania Trump helped break ground for the project in October 2019. Construction was in partnership with the Trust for the National Mall and the National Park Service. The new building was funded by private donations. The White House did not disclose the cost. Did someone forward this email to you? Sign up here ."

JOE BIDEN""S REVISIONISM : POLITICO""s Sarah Wheaton reports : For a politician who projects authenticity, Vice President JOE BIDEN seemed to stumble around the truth on Tuesday. It wasn""t just that he contradicted his previous accounts of the U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden, claiming for the first time that he did indeed recommend that President Barack Obama go forward with the operation. It was also that he claimed to have veto power over nominations and to speak for the president with more authority than other top officials. Since Biden hasn""t decided whether to run for president, but is facing campaign-level scrutiny, it was up to Obama""s press secretary, Josh Earnest, to handle fact-checking questions about some of Biden""s other revelations. ""I am not aware of the kinds of conversations that then-Sen. Obama had with then-Sen. Biden had about him coming on board as the running mate.

axios|"Joe Biden is unlikely to pursue a carbon tax if he wins in November, according to several people familiar with his campaign's thinking. Driving the news : The campaign said last year it supported a price on carbon emissions, but it has since released policies that embody government mandates, investments and job creation amid the pandemic-induced recession. What they""re saying : The campaign""s positioning reflects the Democratic Party""s overall movement away from a carbon price and a new focus on economic recovery and equality, say people following the presidential nominee""s positions. For the record : Biden campaign spokesperson Matt Hill declined to comment. Public information about the nominee""s positions compel some reading between the lines. The big picture : Most economists and businesses support an explicit carbon price over standards or other policies. They argue it""s the most straightforward and predictable way to cut heat-trapping emissions. The other side : A growing list of corporations and lobbying interests have poured money into carbon tax campaigns on Capitol Hill in recent years, but these efforts have not produced public results. What we""re watching : If Democrats take control of the Senate, its leaders could pursue a carbon tax, opening up a narrow path for congressional bargaining that Biden could back as president.

axios|"Joe Biden said at an event in Wilmington, Del., on Wednesday that the police officers in Jacob Blake's shooting and Breonna Taylor's murder ""need to be charged,"" and called for an investigation into the individual who shot and killed a Trump supporter in Portland last weekend. Driving the news: Biden was asked about these situations after delivering remarks about how to open school safely in light of the coronavirus pandemic. It comes during a week in which he's been out on the trail countering Trump's attacks about violence and unrest in America. What they're saying: ""I think we should let the judicial system work its way,"" Biden said when asked by a reporter if he agrees with his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, that the officers who shot Blake and Taylor should be charged. Between the lines: President Trump has not called for charges against the officers in either the Blake or Taylor cases, but condemned the Portland shooting as ""disgraceful."" On Monday, he defended the 17-year-old supporter of his who shot and killed two people in Kenosha, Wisconsin, suggesting that he was acting in self-defense. The big picture: Biden reiterated his belief that ""the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable women and men. They pin on that shield every morning and they have a right to go home that night safely. ... They're the ones that want to get rid of the bad cops more than anyone else does, because it reflects on them."""
axios|"Joe Biden is facing growing scrutiny over sexual assault allegations made by a former Senate staffer. The big picture: Business Insider last week published two on-the record corroborations of parts of allegations by Tara Reade, who claims Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993. The former vice president then appeared on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" to publicly deny the allegations for the first time. April 3, 2019: Reade joined several women in accusing Biden of inappropriate touching as a senator in 1993. She told The Union , a local newspaper in California, that on numerous occasions Biden put his hands on her neck and shoulders in ways that made her uncomfortable. March 25, 2020: Reade told journalist Katie Halper on a podcast that in 1993, Biden pinned her against a wall in a Senate building, reached under her clothes and penetrated her with his fingers while kissing her. April 9: Reade filed a police report claiming she was the victim of a sexual assault in 1993. She tweeted that she did so solely for ""safety reasons,"" acknowledging that the statute of limitations had run out on her complaint. April 12-13: The New York Times , Washington Post and AP all published investigations into Reade's allegations. April 24: The Intercept reported that Reade's mother called into CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Aug. 11, 1993, and said her daughter had just left her job working for a ""prominent senator"" in Washington, where she ""could not get through with her problems at all."" April 27: Two sources went on the record to Business Insider to corroborate certain details of Reade's allegation. April 30: Reade told Fox News she filed a complaint to the Senate personnel office almost 30 years ago. Reade said the complaint would prove that she went to top Biden aides to discuss her problems with the then-senator, and that they have since lied about their recollections of those conversations. May 1: Biden personally addressed the allegations for the first time on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" saying ""They aren""t true. This never happened."" May 2: Reade told the AP that she filed a ""limited"" report on Biden with a congressional personnel office that did not explicitly accuse him of sexual harassment or assault. May 4: The Secretary of the Senate said it cannot comply with Biden's request to release documents pertaining to Reade's alleged 1993 complaint. The office said it ""has no discretion to disclose"" the information because of laws pertaining to confidentiality. For the record: The Biden campaign has strongly denied all of Reade's allegations in statements provided to media organizations: May 7: Asked whether Biden should drop out in an excerpt of an interview with Megyn Kelly , Reade said: ""I wish he would,"" adding it's ""a little late"" for an apology. May 22: Lawyer Douglas Wigdor, whose firm has represented plaintiffs in high-profile discrimination cases, announced that he was no longer representing Reade."
axios|"Joe Biden announced Tuesday  that he has chosen  Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) as his running mate. Why it matters: It's a historic pick. Harris is both the first Black woman and first Asian American woman to be named to a major-party U.S. presidential ticket, and potentially the first woman vice president if Biden defeats President Trump. The big picture: Harris was probably the safest choice Biden could have made among his running mate finalists. She has a national profile and experience with elected office, was vetted and tested in the Democratic presidential primaries and can boost Biden's fundraising. What he's saying: ""I need someone working alongside me who is smart, tough, and ready to lead. Kamala is that person,"" Biden announced in a statement. Harris tweeted  after the news broke: ""Joe Biden can unify the American people because he's spent his life fighting for us. And as president, he'll build an America that lives up to our ideals. I'm honored to join him as our party's nominee for Vice President, and do what it takes to make him our Commander-in-Chief."" What's next: Biden's campaign said he and Harris will deliver remarks in Wilmington, Delaware, on Wednesday on ""working together to restore the soul of the nation and fight for working families to move the country forward."" Between the lines: The pick gives Biden a running mate with strong prosecutorial skills, as Harris has proven at Senate hearings and during her strongest debate moments. That could help them make the case against Trump in the fall. The backstory: Harris, who at 55 is more than 20 years younger than Biden, was born to an Indian mother and Jamaican father who immigrated to California. She had been seen as a front-runner when she announced her presidential campaign in January 2019, but she was never able to capitalize on the early momentum — except for a brief spike in public attention after her confrontation with Biden over federally mandated school busing at a June debate. As a presidential candidate, Harris campaigned on a $500-a-month tax credit that she called ""the largest working and middle-class tax cut in a generation."" She started out as a supporter of Medicare for All, but then switched to an alternative that would have preserved a role for private insurance. Harris has also faced some criticisms based on cases she argued and policies she enacted as California's attorney general: Reality check: It will be Biden who sets the policies if he wins — but Harris' record will be relevant if she's elected vice president, especially if she takes ownership of specific issues and projects as Biden did when he was Barack Obama's vice president. What to watch: Harris' speech accepting the nomination at the Democratic convention will be her chance to introduce herself to an audience of general election voters — and to show how well she and Biden will be able to work as a team.

axios|"Hosting historians around a long table in the East Room earlier this month, President Biden took notes in a black book as they discussed some of his most admired predecessors. Then he said to Doris Kearns Goodwin: ""I'm no FDR, but … "" Why it matters: He'd like to be. The March 2 session, which the White House kept under wraps, reflects Biden's determination to be one of the most consequential presidents. The big picture: Biden's presidency has already been transformative, and he has many more giant plans teed up that could make Biden's New Deal the biggest change to governance in our lifetimes. Behind the scenes: Attendees tell me  that the afternoon session with historians was held in a White House that was ghostly quiet, because many fewer aides are working in Biden's COVID-era West Wing than are typical. To some of the guests, it felt like a snow day. Instead of the stewards who had served many of the historians on past visits, a self-serve coffee urn was set out against one wall. Biden made it clear to his guests that he knew the gravity of the multiple crises facing America. He knew a lot about Franklin D. Roosevelt, and peppered Goodwin with questions about the World War II leader. Afterward, Biden told an aide: ""I could have gone another two hours.""

axios|"Foreign policy will look drastically different if Joe Biden defeats President Trump in November, advisers tell Axios — starting with a Day One announcement that the U.S. is re-entering the Paris Climate Agreement and new global coordination of the coronavirus response. The big picture: If Trump's presidency started the ""America First"" era of withdrawal from global alliances, Biden's team says his presidency would be the opposite: a re-engagement with the world and an effort to rebuild those alliances — fast. Driving the news: Biden advisers who watched the 2008-09 financial crisis consume Obama""s early days say that, similarly, the domestic challenges posed by the coronavirus will demand much of the next administration""s attention while the global impacts may compete with other priorities. But the coronavirus is just the beginning. Biden's advisers look at the world they could inherit and feel a sense of dread and urgency in every time zone: Climate change, Iran""s breakout time for a nuclear weapon, North Korea""s missile advancement, a revanchist Russia and an assertive China. Don't forget: In July 2008, Obama did a world tour promising to end the Bush administration's foreign policy approach and embrace multilateralism. Our thought bubble: The core Biden foreign policy team served in the Obama administration. Between the lines : Biden and Obama had several serious policy differences. In some cases, Biden played devil's advocate to help Obama arrive at a decision, but there were some genuine divergences. Though Biden's policies would be quite different from Trump's, his team may embrace a tactic that Trump also favors when trying to achieve major strategic goals: Overwhelm the circuits and push on multiple fronts at once."
axios|"Former Vice President and 2020 Democratic hopeful Joe Biden on Wednesday played down growing concerns that China is on the verge of surpassing the U.S. as a dominant global economic and national security superpower, saying: ""They're not competition for us."" Our thought bubble , per Axios' Joe Uchill: While Biden may be right that resource management could cap China's potential, that hasn't stopped the country from stealing billions of dollars in intellectual property through cyber and other means, providing stiff competition in tech fields — in part, due to stolen intellectual property — and investing threatening amounts in emerging fields like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. In telecom equipment, China has 2 of the top 5 companies in the world, with Huawei being No. 1.

One of the rare things Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and President Trump agree on is that China is a rising, increasingly urgent threat to the U.S. The context: Biden has made similar comments before . At a Democratic campaign event in Florida in October 2018, Biden said the U.S. is ""better positioned than any nation in the world to own the 21st century,"" adding that China is ""a divided country in 1,000 ways ...

axios|"Joe Biden is considering asking Congress to help suffering Americans in two steps: give them the balance of their coveted $2,000 coronavirus payments, followed by a $3 trillion tax and infrastructure package. Why it matters: Biden is confident he can get multiple packages through Congress after Democrats won both Georgia Senate elections. The president-elect's team also wants to get cash in Americans' hands as quickly as possible, according to people familiar with the matter. The big picture: In July Biden rolled out his Build Back Better plan, which includes billions of dollars for caregivers, incentives for manufacturers and some $2 trillion for green jobs and infrastructure spending. Democrats are concerned that if they miss early opportunities to combat COVID and reverse its broader effect on the economy, the twin problems could cripple the rest of Biden""s presidency. Reverting to Plan A: Biden is essentially dusting off his pre-election plans, back when many of his economic and political advisers assumed that if he won the presidency, he would carry the Senate along with him. Be smart: Biden""s blitz for a quick spending measure could allow him to build goodwill with Senate Republicans for a bigger package in the spring, especially if it includes liability protection the GOP wants for businesses fearing coronavirus lawsuits. Editor's note: This story has been corrected to note that Biden's Build Back Better plan includes $2 trillion for green jobs and infrastructure spending, not $4 trillion."
usa_today|"A viral TikTok video misrepresents a clip of then-Vice President Joe Biden with his grandson to claim that he inappropriately touched the young boy. However, the video neglects to share the context in which it was taken. The original video and TikTok account have been taken down , however, versions of it continue to spread on other platforms. These posts offer misleading context meant to support the false claim that Biden is a pedophile. The April 29 video shows Biden holding his grandson's face, kissing him on the cheek and rubbing the back of his head. It has been viewed more than 120,000 times on TikTok and since been shared several times on Facebook and Instagram . Neither the TikTok video nor versions shared on Facebook give any indication that the video was taken at Beau Biden""s funeral.  Beau Biden, Joe Biden's eldest son, died of brain cancer on May 30, 2015, at age 46. The videos also don't identify the boy as Robert Hunter Biden II, Beau's son. Fact check: The image of the Bidens and Carters together is distorted, but very real While the post does not explicitly say Joe Biden was behaving inappropriately, the TikTok sound used and the comments left behind by viewers made the implication clear. ""Two best friends in a room, they might kiss. Yes, we will. What? I said yes we will,"" the audio begins before playing the chorus to "" Promiscuous "" by Nelly Furtado. On TikTok, this sound is typically used in videos of couples. The TikTok account that posted this video, @starscree, has used this audio and the hashtag #hidenfrombiden when sharing several misleading videos of Joe Biden with children.

The address, scheduled for May 19, will be the second time Biden has addressed a graduating class at the academy. He served as the keynote speaker in 2013 while serving as vice president. This will be Biden's first commencement address to a military service academy as commander in chief and his first official visit to Connecticut as president. ""It will be a memorable event for our community, as well as a great opportunity to showcase the academy and the city of New London on a national stage,"" Rear Adm.

usa_today|"You""re reading the Opposing View , one of two perspectives in Today""s Debate. For Our View, read Where are Republicans' competitive ideas? There should be debate over what commonsense, common-defined infrastructure looks like. As I said in my response to President Joe Biden's joint address to Congress, Republicans support everything you think of when you think of ""infrastructure."" Roads, bridges, ports, airports, waterways, high-speed broadband – we""re all in. This administration has been ignoring good-faith, bipartisan efforts. Democrats have tried to slip in numerous partisan, progressive policies, including increasing the corporate tax rate to one of the highest percentages in the world. This would only disadvantage hardworking Americans and hike up inflation. Six percent of Biden's plan goes to roads and bridges . Where does the other 94% go? To a liberal wish list of Big Government waste, funded by the biggest job-killing tax hikes in a generation. Republicans aren""t alone in opposing this waste. In fact, one of the only bipartisan parts of this conversation is the opposition to President Biden's ""infrastructure"" bill. Both of my colleagues from West Virginia – Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, and Joe Manchin, a Democrat – have vocally opposed the proposal, the so-called American Jobs Plan, or parts of it. I reject the premise that congressional Republicans have not proposed commonsense, common-ground alternatives. Led by Sen. Capito, we have proposed an alternative bill that sharpens the focus on infrastructure  priorities. Republicans have continuously come to the table to work with this administration, but what good do these conversations produce if President Biden and congressional Democrats will circumvent the will of half the nation to push through this Trojan horse of progressive policies? We've seen them do it once with the ""COVID relief bill,"" and we may see them do it again here. We have much more in common than we think, and if we can come together for the sake of our nation and its true infrastructure needs, we can once again build a stronger foundation for the next generation. If we work together, I am more than hopeful – I am confident – that our finest hour is yet to come. Tim Scott is a Republican Senator from South Carolina."

usa_today|"WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden never promised a wholesale reversal of his predecessor""s approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But he blasted many of the Trump administration""s decisions as ""destructive"" and ""short-sighted."" Yet four months into his term, Biden has left many of President Donald Trump""s pro-Israel policies in place – leading to frustration in Washington and the Middle East. During his four years in office, Trump broke with long-standing U.S. positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – offering full-throated support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line agenda, greenlighting Jewish settlement expansion and severing diplomatic channels with the Palestinians, among other steps. Biden has been clear he supports a two-state solution to the intransigent conflict, but he has punted on some of the most contentious issues, even as the worst violence in years grips the region. The spark that ignited the conflict was an effort by Jewish settlers to evict Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem. It has spiraled into a deadly military confrontation between Hamas, the terrorist group that controls Gaza, and Israeli military forces. Saturday, an Israeli airstrike on a refugee camp killed at least 10 Palestinians from an extended family, mostly children, the deadliest single strike of the current conflict, according to The Associated Press. In less than a week of fighting, more than 120 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and at least seven Israelis. Hitting Gaza:  Israeli airstrikes in Gaza kill 10, destroy media offices for AP, Al-Jazeera Associated Press CEO on strike: 'The world will know less about what is happening in Gaza' ""The current violent escalation shows that this is not an issue that can be left on the back burner. It's not a sustainable status quo,"" said Logan Bayroff, vice president of communication for J Street, a left-leaning advocacy group that describes itself as ""pro-Israel, pro-peace."" Here's a look and what Trump did and how Biden's position differs – or not. Fulfilling a campaign promise, Trump broke with decades of Washington policy and moved the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018, backing Israel""s claim on the disputed capital and holy city for Jews, Muslims and Christians. The decision thrilled his base of conservative and right-wing Israel supporters and evangelical Christians but brought a wave of criticism from the international community and the Palestinians. Trump""s decision followed through on a 1995 law that recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, which Biden voted for as a senator. Successive presidents delayed the move, aligning with the international view that the holy city's status should be negotiated between the Israelis and Palestinians as part of a broader peace deal that would establish a Palestinian state. The Biden administration signaled it has no intention of moving the American embassy back to Tel Aviv. Biden, as a presidential candidate, said he would keep the embassy in Jerusalem despite calling Trump's decision ""short-sighted and frivolous."" The administration has been silent about what it defines as Jerusalem's boundaries, part of a larger U.S. policy vacuum feeding into the situation on the ground, said Khaled Elgindy, director of the program on Palestinian-Israeli affairs at the Middle East Institute. Though Israel claims Jerusalem as its capital, the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The United States is one of a handful of countries to recognize Israel's claim to the entirety of the city. East Jerusalem, which Israel occupied along with the West Bank, Gaza, most of the Syrian Golan Heights and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula in 1967, has become a flashpoint for unrest and protests, where the threat of eviction of Palestinian families exacerbated the violence. ""There's no credible way to have a Palestinian state without a sovereign capital in East Jerusalem,"" Elgindy said. ""It changes the way that you address the expulsions. If you do recognize it, then what's happening is not a property dispute, it's settlement activity, and it's illegal under international law."" More: Biden speaks with Netanyahu, Abbas as Mideast conflict escalates White House press secretary Jen Psaki sidestepped a question about the president's position on East Jerusalem as part of a two-state solution. ""That is an issue that has long been and will always be for discussion between two parties in a negotiation about the path forward, so I don't have an additional position,"" she said Friday. The administration has been evasive about whether it plans to reopen the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem, which had served as the White House""s main channel of communication to the Palestinians. The Trump administration shuttered the consulate in 2019 and merged it with the embassy to serve as one diplomatic mission. Psaki did not answer questions Wednesday on whether the administration would reopen that diplomatic facility. Like his predecessors, Trump said he wanted to broker an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal , and he tasked his son-in-law, Jared Kusher, to tackle one of the world's longest-running and most intractable disputes. Trump initially waffled on whether he supported a ""two-state solution,"" a cornerstone of U.S. policy for decades. The two-state solution envisions a negotiated settlement leading to an independent Palestinian nation alongside Israel and sharing a capital of East Jerusalem. In an early meeting with Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu at the White House, Trump said he was neutral on the issue. ""So I'm looking at two-state or the one-state,"" Trump said in 2017 . ""I'm happy with the one they like best,"" he said, referring to the Israelis and Palestinians. When Kushner unveiled his much-delayed peace proposal – the ""deal of the century"" – it endorsed a two-state solution, though critics said the plan was definitively pro-Israel. The plan was developed without any Palestinian input; Palestinian leaders refused to deal with the Trump administration because they viewed him and his advisers as biased toward Israel. The proposal – which went nowhere – would have more than doubled territory under Palestinian control, but it also would have recognized Israeli sovereignty over major settlement blocs in the West Bank, a scenario many Palestinians would find difficult to accept. It would have limited Palestinians to specific parts of East Jerusalem, leaving Israel in sole charge of holy sites that are sacred to both religions. The Biden administration supports a two-state solution, though Biden has not made solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict a priority. Though many presidents named high-wattage special envoys to jump-start the peace process, Biden has not done so. Amid the current conflagration, the State Department dispatched a deputy assistant secretary for Israeli and Palestinian Affairs, Hady Amr, to the region to help mediate. In March 2019, Trump overturned decades of U.S. policy by recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights , a disputed territory that Israel seized from Syrian control during the Six-Day War in 1967. Previous U.S. administrations labeled the territory as ""occupied"" and refused to recognize Israel's forcible annexation. Trump's move prompted a rebuke from the United Nations Security Council and put the United States at odds with allies such as France and the United Kingdom, which see Israel's annexation as illegal. Trump argued the territory is critical to Israel's security, and Netanyahu welcomed the move as historic. Trump-Netanyahu: How two leaders reap political rewards from their cozy relationship From friendly to frosty: Biden and Netanyahu's decadeslong relationship tested by crisis In February, Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested Biden would leave the Trump-era policy in place, though he did not fully endorse the annexation either. ""As a practical matter, the control of the Golan in that situation, I think, remains of real importance to Israel""s security,"" Blinken told CNN in February. ""Legal questions are something else, and over time if the situation were to change in Syria, that""s something we look at, but we are nowhere near that."" In 2018, the Trump administration moved to zero out funding for the U.N. aid program for Palestinian refugees, part of a broader policy restricting assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. The U.N. Relief and Works Agency provides health care to more than 3 million Palestinians, education assistance to 500,000 children, micro-loans to 400,000 beneficiaries and other aid. Trump's State Department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said that the United States shouldered a ""very disproportionate share"" of the cost for UNRWA and that the group classified too many Palestinians as refugees. In April, the Biden administration announced it would restore funding for the relief agency and other programs, sending $75 million in economic and development assistance to the West Bank and Gaza, $10 million for peace-building programs through the U.S. Agency for International Development, and $150 million for UNRWA. The Trump administration trumpeted the so-called Abraham Accords, a series of agreements that formalized diplomatic relations between Israel and four Arab countries – the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan – as one of its greatest foreign policy achievements and a step toward peace in the region. The accords marked a major geopolitical shift in the Middle East as Arab nations once unified behind a push for Palestinian statehood solidified their ties with Israel. But the UAE and Bahrain were never at war with Israel, and their leaders had been quietly inching toward closer relations with the Jewish state for years. Though Trump and Netanyahu billed the accords as a ""peace deal,"" the agreements largely sidelined the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. ""That was always somewhere between spin and wishful thinking. They were about bilateral relations of the parties that signed them. They""re not peace agreements,"" Elgindy said. ""To the contrary, I think they were designed by Netanyahu and Trump to marginalize the Palestinians as both a people and as an issue."" Blinken told CNN in February the administration applauded the accords, calling them ""an important step forward"" but hardly a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. ""Whenever we see Israel and its neighbors normalizing relations, improving relations, that""s good for Israel, it""s good for the other countries in question, it""s good for overall peace and security,"" Blinken said. ""That doesn""t mean that the challenges of the relationship between Israel and the Palestinians go away. ... They""re not going to miraculously disappear. And so we need to engage on that."" As part of a deal with the UAE, Israel agreed to temporarily halt its controversial plan to annex parts of the West Bank, land that Palestinians see as vital to their hopes of a future state. Less than a year later, the signatory nations find themselves in an uncomfortable position as the notion that the accords would give them leverage over Israel to aid in the Palestinian push ring hollow. ""The pretense that this was ever going to facilitate or help the Israeli-Palestinian peace track has now fallen away,"" Elgindy said. The Arab world has watched Israeli ground troops mass on the border with Gaza, rockets fired indiscriminately at Israeli towns and raids on the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem during the holiest time of the Muslim calendar. The Biden administration has taken a back-seat approach to the spate of violence, emphasizing its traditional position of de-escalation, but the language is inconsistent with the president's promise of prioritizing human rights and restoring international rules-based order, Elgindy said. ""If the United States isn't putting up a clear red light, then it's by default a green light for Israel,"" he said. Contributing: Kim Hjelmgaard"
usa_today|"For the last 15 years I""ve protected Arizonans and Americans from dangerous criminals – the past eight working for the United States Attorney""s Office securing the southwest border. I""ve seen how decisions made in the halls of power – whether it be Washington, D.C., or Phoenix – play out on the ground. When our leaders put politics and political correctness before safety and security, there are real life consequences. I know this because I""ve had face-to-face conversations with cartel members and listened to wiretaps on their phones. I""ve investigated them for drug trafficking, human smuggling, murders and mutilations. That was my job. I was a border security section chief for the District of Arizona. In March, the flood of immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally was 67% higher than at the same time in 2019, when the United States last experienced a surge of immigrants at the border. According to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, "" We are on pace to encounter more individuals on the southwest border than we have in the last 20 years."" Our southern border is not secure. This is a crisis. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has declared a state of emergency in several counties and deployed the National Guard. And it is a crisis that is entirely President Joe Biden""s making. Every action by this administration sends a direct signal to bad actors who control the flow of immigrants and drugs across the border. The media frenzy surrounding Biden""s border crisis has served to cover up another truly frightening aspect of this administration""s immigration policy: the release of criminals from jails and prisons. On Inauguration Day, the Department of Homeland Security issued an immediate 100-day pause on certain deportations . The victims of illegal immigration: My son was murdered by an illegal immigrant. Neither he nor Mollie Tibbetts deserved to die. With few exceptions, individuals who were going to be deported and were just awaiting their complimentary flight (or walk) back to their home countries would no longer be removed. The immediate consequence was that convicted felons who did not have permission to be in the United States were released from prisons after their sentences and let onto the streets. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton successfully sued Washington and obtained a nationwide temporary restraining order preventing DHS from enforcing the 100-day moratorium. But the Biden administration simply issued replacement guidance , which had the same effect. Immigration and Customs Enforcement got the message – individuals who do not meet certain enforcement priorities should not be removed from the country. And unlike the 100-day pause, this new guidance has no expiration date. Janet Napolitano: Biden is making immigration moves that will pay off The Biden administration""s enforcement priorities are so narrow that they exclude many violent offenders. Take, for example, the ""public safety"" priority . It allows ICE to remove individuals who have been convicted of an ""aggravated felony."" Sounds serious, right? But what if I told you that some murder convictions do not qualify as aggravated felonies. To put it in perspective, at least one of the killing offenses for which former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin was convicted would not qualify . I prosecuted a Honduran in 2014 who had been denied asylum but returned to the United States and got into an altercation during which he hit his victim in the head with a metal bar, fracturing his skull. The resulting aggravated assault conviction was not an aggravated felony. Many immigrants live in fear, lack basic rights: We have the power to change the system. Just last year, the 9th Circuit ruled that if an individual harms a pregnant mother and kills her unborn fetus, a murder conviction based on that conduct would not qualify as an aggravated felony. An Oregon robbery conviction was also excluded from the definition. Another 9th Circuit opinion called into question whether a child pornography conviction would qualify even when a child under 16 was involved.

usa_today|"Correction: This article has been updated to correct information provided by the Biden administration related to preschool in Missouri and child poverty in Arizona. WASHINGTON –  Only 11.2% of Idaho's 3- and 4-year olds are enrolled in publicly funded preschool, the lowest share in the nation. The average cost of putting an infant in a child care center in California eats up an average 18% of household income. And an expanded tax credit for children that President Joe Biden has included in a proposed package of education and safety net programs for families would reduce by more than half the child poverty in Alaska and Oklahoma while Arizona would see a 45% reduction. Those are some of the statistics in state-specific fact sheets , provided first to USA TODAY, that the administration will use to pitch its trillion-dollar plan focused on child care and education both nationally and to governors, mayors, county leaders and local groups. The Biden administration is looking to shore up support across the country for its families plan, which is expected to face a steep climb in Congress as Republicans decry it as excess government spending. The White House saw some success in a similar effort earlier this year, when it directly pitched Americans on the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package before passing it without Republican support. The American Families Plan, as the White House calls it, is the companion to a $2.3 trillion infrastructure and jobs plan also aimed at making major investments that Democrats argue are long overdue. The $1.8 trillion package of spending increases and tax breaks would be offset by tax increases on the wealthiest households. The U.S. ranks among the lowest among the wealthiest nations that offer child care benefits and paid leave benefits, which also contributes to one of the worst child poverty rates among developed nations. The coronavirus pandemic laid bare the gaps in child care as millions of women were forced to leave their jobs and shoulder the burden at home. But an expansion of social welfare programs is likely to be a tougher sell in the narrowly divided Congress than Biden""s plan to increase funding for roads, broadband and water projects – areas of spending that have enjoyed more bipartisan support. The tax increases Biden has proposed to pay for both packages are also a nonstarter for Republicans. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., predicted Monday that no Republican would support the combination of plans. ""One-hundred percent of my focus is on stopping this new administration,"" McConnell said Wednesday. Biden and other top administration are traveling around the country, hitting the airways and dialing up lawmakers to push the package. ""This will grow the economy,"" Biden said Monday during a visit to a community college in Virginia. ""Everybody will be better off."" The administration got some backup for that assertion in an assessment released Tuesday by Moody""s Analytics. Chief economist Mark Zandi and assistant director Bernard Yaros wrote that the families plan will boost the economy by increasing labor force participation and educational attainment while also addressing income inequality. More: The child care industry collapsed during COVID-19, so Biden""s giving it $39B from the stimulus But an analysis released Wednesday by Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan group at the University of Pennsylvania""s Wharton School, projects that the costs of Biden's plan will exceed new revenue by 2050, causing a drag on the economy despite productivity gains. Wharton""s Kent Smetters noted that the welfare of a nation isn't fully captured solely by the size of the economy, and people can be better off overall even if the economy is smaller than what it would be without the changes. Still, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday that the administration strongly disagrees with the analysis, which calculated a higher cost for the proposals than the White House factored in. A big reason for the difference is the Wharton team used the full cost of free preschool and two free years of community college even though the administration expects states to share the tab. ""How are states going to pay for it? Are they going to increase taxes?"" said Rich Prisinzano, director of policy analysis for the Penn Wharton Budget Model. ""That""s all going to have an effect."" Another costly component is an extension through 2025 of the enhanced child tax credits that was passed in Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Biden also wants to pay for child care for the neediest families and ensure that those who earn up to 1.5 times their state median income won""t have to pay more than 7% of their income on child care. In Massachusetts, a two-parent household has to spend an average of 15% of income on care for one child, according to the White House. In Indiana, where child care is about half as expensive but incomes are lower, a household spends an average of 12% of income. Women""s participation in the workforce is one of the lowest rates for developed economies because of the high cost of child care and of caring for other needy family members, according to Moody""s. In Massachusetts and Indiana the workforce gender gap is 23%, meaning mothers' participation rate is 23 percentage points lower than fathers', according to the White House. Beyond child care, Biden wants all 3- and 4-year-olds to have access to free, high-quality prekindergarten, regardless of family income. But the White House expects states to pick up some of the cost – 10% initially and 50% eventually. Administration officials say they""re optimistic states will want to participate in the expansion, pointing to the fact that some conservative states like Oklahoma have statewide pre-K programs. Nearly 60% of Oklahoma's 3- and 4-year olds are enrolled in publicly funded preschool, according to the administration. ""Many states are investing in preschool and looking to expand access to preschool,"" said Carmel Martin, White House deputy domestic policy adviser for upward mobility. The plan will benefit states like Missouri, where only 18% of 3- and 4-year-olds are enrolled in publicly funded pre-school, according to the Biden administration. The proposed partnership is also a recognition that states and localities are needed to help drive delivery of the program. Much like the president's COVID-19 stimulus package, which saw broad support across the country , the administration is betting on the popularity of its families plan among voters. A Morning Consult/Politico poll released Thursday found that 58% of registered voters say they support Biden's American Families Plan, including 54% of independents and 25% of Republicans. Among the most popular provisions were child care subsidies for low- and middle-income workers (64%) and free preschool (63%). More: 'Dinner table' politics: Why Joe Biden ditched bipartisan dealmaking to pass his COVID-19 relief bill More: Amid calls for unity, President Biden and Republicans don't agree what that looks like But a dozen states have rejected federal funding to expand Medicaid in part over ideological concerns about federal entanglement and not trusting Washington to keep its funding promise. In addition, some states have resisted existing federal preschool grants, objecting to federal control or other issues. The White House said states would have a big role in defining and implementing the quality standards for preschools. And if a state doesn""t participate, the federal government will try to partner with local communities. The rollout wouldn't be as immediate as the COVID-19 stimulus package, which saw $1,400 checks sent directly to Americans and provided a boost in funding for state vaccine campaigns. Instead, some programs would require states to buy into programs that would be phased in over 10 years, including free pre-K and expanding access to high-quality child care, which Biden wants to also include raising employee pay to at least $15 per hour. Martin said it may be relatively easier for some states to scale up programs like preschool in states like Oklahoma and Georgia, where pre-K programs are already in place. ""Our cost estimates assume that full implementation will take some time, as to stand up the program and people gain awareness that the programs are available,"" Martin said. ""In some instances, states and local communities may need to build the capacity of the system to support all those who are eligible."" That""s only, of course, if the proposal is enacted. After the infrastructure and jobs package was released at the end of March, Psaki said Biden wanted to see progress by May and passage by summer. She declined on Tuesday to set a time frame for action on the families plan.

usa_today|"WASHINGTON —  Mayors are accustomed to juggling priorities with limited city revenue: Park upgrades or staff pay increases? Street paving or that long-awaited new community center? The crunch tightened during a global pandemic. But an infusion of $350 billion in federal COVID-19 rescue funds now headed to local and state governments this week sets up a new – and welcomed – dilemma: how to spend a financial windfall. Two months after President Joe Biden signed his American Rescue Plan into law, the Treasury Department on Monday made available a historic amount of direct aid to thousands of city and county governments. Local governments are in line to collectively receive more than $110 billion over two years in addition to $125 billion for the reopening of public schools. Another $195.3 billion will go to states. ""For the most part, city budgets are in a survival mode anyway. There's not a lot of money,"" said Louisville, Ky., Mayor Greg Fischer, whose city lost around 5% to 10% during the pandemic. ""So these funds kind of get us back to where we were, which was not resourced as well as we should be. But it's much better than just surviving."" More: States, cities to receive first chunk of $350 billion in aid this week from COVID stimulus passed in March A year ago, tax revenue collections nosedived in cities as businesses shuttered during state-ordered lockdowns at the start of the pandemic. Many cities cut government workers and programs. The aid is designed to replenish governments with revenue they lost, allowing mayors to hire cops and firefighters or launch capital projects that were halted. Even though doomsday revenue scenarios initially forecasted didn't materialize, the public sector lost 1.3 million jobs since the start of the pandemic, according to the Treasury Department. Yet the fiscal situations vary in towns and cities across the country. Some mayors say hardships remain, with unemployment still below last year's mark and revenue struggling to catch up. For others, the emergency has largely passed. ""We just got the largest sales tax check in city history last week,"" said Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt, whose city saw tax collections drop 5% during the pandemic. Holt was among more than 30 Republican mayors who publicly pushed for the COVID relief funds, despite GOP resistance in Washington. Now, sales tax in Oklahoma City is coming in 38% higher than last spring. More: 'The need is real': GOP mayors embrace Biden's COVID-19 relief plan even as Republican lawmakers pan it ""I would have told you two months ago, we're going to spend the money to restore our police and fire budgets. But we don't necessarily have that need now. It's just taken too long for it all to happen,"" he said. ""I can't go back now and fill a police position in June of 2020."" Still, he said Oklahoma City will have a ""methodical and thoughtful conversation"" on how to make sure the funds have a lasting legacy. ""We're going to make good use of it. Maybe now, it's more recovery and less rescue."" Most cities haven't finalized how they will spend its funds, and several plan to engage the public before deciding. The money follows a year-long lobbying effort in Washington by the U.S. Conference of Mayors after the pandemic hit. The federal CARES Act, signed by former President Donald Trump last year, offered relief to only the 38 cities with 500,000 or more people in addition to states. CARES funds were also limited to expenses ""directly related"" to COVID-19, not replacing lost revenue. Democrats pushed for direct aid for state and cities in subsequent relief packages but the Republican-controlled Senate opposed it. Cities will receive aid from the American Rescue Plan in two tranches – one this year, the second in 12 months. Payments are expected within days after the Treasury Department approves a city's application. Dollar amounts were determined by population and poverty in each community. Money must be spent by the end of 2024. More: Do states and cities 'need' Biden's $350 billion in direct COVID-19 relief? It depends where you're asking In Nashville, which relies heavily on tourists drawn to the honky-tonk bars and downtown nightlife, hotel taxes designated to pay off the city's convention center debt fell by two-thirds during the pandemic. Sales tax collections initially dropped by around 40%. The city avoided cuts thanks largely to a property tax increase. ""It's very well-received,"" said Nashville Mayor John Cooper, who referred to the aid as ""the Biden money"" – $260 million which will go to Nashville over two years. Cooper, a Democrat, said it will be no trouble to find uses in a ""growing city with lot of challenges."" He's proposed $20 million from the relief package to boost two affordable housing funds as housing prices skyrocket in Nashville even amid the pandemic. Other priorities include: boosting the city's ongoing public health efforts, repairing emergency vehicle fleets, flood mitigation, and funding homelessness, mental health and small business initiatives. Unlike the CARES Act, public school systems are funded separately in the rescue plan. ""The nice thing for us is that we can look at the Biden money and not have to worry first about education. They've got their own path to a large amount of funding,"" Cooper said. More: Money for colleges, libraries and clubs: 10 things you might not know are in Biden's COVID-19 relief package The Treasury Department has provided strict guidelines for the funds. Eligible uses include: public health expenditures such as coronavirus mitigation efforts and medical expenses; addressing negative economic impacts, including a reduction of public sector workers or small businesses hurt by the pandemic; replacing lost tax revenue; tackling poverty and offering additional pay for essential workers. Local and state governments are also authorized to use the money to invest in water and sewer or broadband infrastructure. Cities are prohibited from using funds to contribute to pension funds, pad reserves, cover debt service or pay legal settlements. More than 250 mayors participated in a Zoom call this week hosted by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, led by Fischer, the group's president, to discuss how they can spend the money. ""We asked everybody on the call, 'Have you all gotten back to your pre-COVID number on employees?' And nobody said they did,"" said Dayton, Ohio, Mayor Nan Whaley, vice president of the conference of mayors, whose city saw tax collections drop between 8% and 10% during the pandemic. Whaley, who hopes to use funds to pay for new police and firefighter classes that were put off last year, said the relief money can be ""transformational"" for cities. Yet mayors on the call – while pleased to receive the money – also raised concerns about the limitations. Cities can use funds on targeted relief for communities in low-income census tracts disproportionately hurt by the pandemic, but primarily through health and housing initiatives. Whaley said mayors would also like to be able to use the funds on new community centers, health centers or markets to respond to food deserts in these areas. ""For us, it is really key in these qualified census tracts that we get broader than just housing,"" Whaley said. ""That's not going to cut it for really transformational change for these folks that have really be so economically impacted by Covid. And I think Treasury knows that."" More: Republicans draw 'red line' in negotiations with Joe Biden on infrastructure package The Treasury Department has opened a 60-day window to take in feedback from mayors and governors on the funds. Bryan Barnett, Republican mayor of Rochester Hills, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, said he hoped to use a portion of the $6.2 million his city will receive on road improvements. But roads, bridges and other general infrastructure are not among the acceptable uses unless approved through lost revenue replacement. Biden is pushing approval for a $2.3 trillion jobs plan that include more than $600 billion on transportation infrastructure. ""I don't know if it's because they don't want it to interfere with the president's infrastructure bill that he's asking for now, but for us it would really meet a more significant need,"" Barnett said. ""We're not going to be paying premium back pay. We don't really have broadband issues here."" White House officials said they included the money for states and cities in the rescue plan because of a lesson learned from the Obama era, when they believe inadequate money for local governments in the 2009 stimulus plan slowed the economic recovery from the Great Recession. ""Personally, we're ready to hit the ground running,"" said Wade Kapszukiewicz, mayor of Toledo, Ohio, which will receive $181 million over two years. Toledo dipped into reserves last year after income tax dropped 8%. Kapszukiewicz, a Democrat, anticipates filing an ordinance this summer to appropriate $40 million to $50 million of the $90 million Toledo will get the first year. He's identified six broad categories where money could go toward: budget stabilization, the well-being of city employees, public safety, housing, neighborhoods and economic development. But because the money is not recurring, he said Toledo will likely use the money to fund one-time capital costs rather than adding new employees. That means sewer work, new police cars or shotspotter technology, he said, rather than new police officers. ""I'd love to be able to hire 100 more police officers in the city of Toledo,"" Kapszukiewicz said. ""But who would want that job? Who would want to be hired on a temporary grant essentially when the money for those 100 positions would run out in two and a half years?"" Miami, which has a population of around 450,000, narrowly missed the threshold to receive relief direct funds under the CARES Act. It's now set to receive $138 million over two years. Last year, the city projected a $25 million deficit, but only ended up with a $2 million shortfall. Florida had laxer Covid guidelines than much of the country, which enabled more businesses to stay open. Despite a fiscal situation that wasn't as bad as feared, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said the money is needed, arguing it will help stimulate the economy and help citizens in need. ""We're going to give it to essential workers who have been working hard throughout the pandemic to keep our citizens safe,"" he said. ""We want to shore up our budget to the extent it needs it and then, of course, almost all of it, we're going to give it back to the people. ""Frankly, it's their money.""

usa_today|"WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden will talk with three Democratic and three Republican governors Tuesday about innovative ways to get more people vaccinated, USA TODAY has learned. Biden will meet virtually with the leaders of Ohio, Utah, Massachusetts, Maine, Minnesota and New Mexico to share best practices as the administration moves toward its goal of getting 70% of adults at least partially vaccinated by July 4. More than half of all residents in Massachusetts, Maine and New Mexico have gotten at least one shot, ranking those states in the top 10. Ohio and Utah are in the bottom half of states for vaccination rates. Biden will acknowledge the important role governors have played in vaccination efforts and how their efforts are crucial for continued progress. Vaccinators are moving beyond the most vulnerable populations and those most eager to get vaccinated into a new phase. ""Now we""re going to have to bring the vaccine to people who are less eager,"" Biden said last week when announcing the 70% goal. Most states are at or near the point where supply is outstripping demand, according to an analysis released last week by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health research organization. Biden's vaccine goal: 70% of adults at least partially vaccinated by July 4 Pace slows: States prepare for long grind as demand for COVID-19 vaccinations in US slows The administration is taking several steps to vaccinate harder-to-reach populations, including redirecting federal assistance from mass vaccination sites  to more pop-up and mobile clinics. Most pharmacies participating in the federal vaccination program are offering walk-in appointments. The administration also is sending doses directly to rural communities. Some cities and states are using financial incentives to get people inoculated. West Virginia offers $100 savings bonds to residents ages 16 to 35 who get a vaccine. Detroit residents can get $50 prepaid debit cards. Maine is providing free fishing and hunting licenses – and free entrance to state parks. Minnesota is partnering with the state""s Muslim community to establish vaccination clinics at more than a dozen mosques during the holy month of Ramadan. Utah""s ""Get Back"" campaign to boost vaccine confidence links vaccines to activities people are eager to resume, such as going to church, cheering in person for the Utah Jazz basketball team and hugging grandparents. And Ohio is piloting a ""Vaccine on Demand"" program that allows small groups to have vaccinators travel to them for shots."
