daily_wire|"The Democratic Party official in Texas who stoked outrage by calling Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) ""an oreo"" resigned Tuesday. ""I am deeply and sincerely sorry for my inappropriate and hurtful use of a racist term I used to describe Sen. Tim Scott on my personal Facebook page. It was insensitive, and I have embarrassed myself and my party by its use,"" Lamar County Democratic Party Chairman Gary O""Connor told The Washington Examiner on Tuesday morning. ""As a result, I feel compelled to offer my resignation as chair of the Lamar County Democratic Party for consideration by the County Executive Committee,"" he said. Following Scott""s rebuttal to President Joe Biden""s address to Congress, O""Connor offended many when he described the African American Republican as ""an oreo."" ""I had hoped that Scott might show some common sense, but it seems clear he is little more than an oreo with no real principles,"" O""Connor wrote before later deleting it. According to Urban Dictionary, ""oreo"" is a ""term for African Americans that the black community is generally offended with for betraying their roots usually for dating caucasian girls, dressing too white, talking too white, etc. The term is branded OREO since they are ""Black on the outside, White on the inside."""" Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott excoriated O""Connor for the remark, tweeting, ""This is disgusting, hateful, and completely unacceptable. O""Connor must apologize to @SenatorTimScott & step down immediately."" Abbott also urged the Texas Democratic Party to ""censure him"" for the racial slur.  Rep. Pat Fallon (R-TX) also described the comment as ""abhorrent, insulting, and unforgivable,"" adding, ""Both he and the entire Lamar County Democratic Party should be ashamed of this racist behavior.""  During his speech responding to Biden last week, Scott said, ""His speech was full of good words. But President Biden promised you a specific kind of leadership. He promised to unite a nation. To lower the temperature. To govern for all Americans, no matter how we voted. That was the pitch. You just heard it again. But our nation is starving for more than empty platitudes. We need policies and progress that bring us closer together."" Scott also defended the U.S. against the president""s claim that the country is racist. ""Hear me clearly: America is not a racist country. It""s backwards to fight discrimination with different types of discrimination. And it""s wrong to try to use our painful past to dishonestly shut down debates in the present."" ""I get called ""Uncle Tom"" and the N-word — by ""progressives."" By liberals,"" Scott also said. ""Uncle Tim"" began trending on Twitter nationally, with comedian and television personality Scott Nevins writing in a since-deleted tweet, ""Sen @TimScottSC is uncle Tom""ing it for his life.

daily_wire|"Vice President Kamala Harris, who was tasked with being the ""point person"" on immigration issues by President Joe Biden on March 24, announced how she intends to combat the ongoing border crisis at the Washington Conference on the Americas. The solution? Fighting climate change. ""Last week, President Joe Biden and I reached the 100th day of our administration. In that time, we have let the world know, and the president has been very clear about this, America is back. We have rejoined the Paris Agreement, we are ending our nation""s longest war, we are rebuilding our alliances and engaging partners all over the world, and we are revitalizing our relationships throughout the Western Hemisphere from the southern most parts of South America to the northern most parts of Canada and everywhere in between,"" Harris"" speech began. ""The strength of the United States of America depends on the strength of all of the Western Hemisphere. In so many ways, our fates are intertwined,"" Harris said later. ""That is especially true of Latin America, one of our fastest growing trade partners, to be sure our relationship with Latin America is bigger than trade and our relationship is incredibly complex and at times has been incredibly complicated."" ""Today, I want to make clear that our administration firmly believes in the potential of the region and in the power of the people of the region. Latin Americans are shaping their own future. They are writing their story. They hold the pen. As I see it, our role is to read those words, take them in, and help however we can as Latin America writes its own next chapter. Put another way, the United States is committed to supporting the vision of the people in the region in their needs for relief, in their hope for opportunity, in their calls for justice."" Harris then continued to vaguely address the border crisis, describing it as an ""immediate situation."" ""Eight years ago, President Joe Biden addressed this conference. Then vice president, he led our nation""s diplomatic efforts within the Northern Triangle and with Mexico. Recently, he asked me to take the lead,"" Harris said. ""This is a priority for our nation and a role that I take very seriously. We are all well aware of the immediate situation. The citizens of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras are leaving their homes at alarming rates, but there""s a fundamental truth behind that headline."" That truth, according to Harris, is that ""People in the region do not want to leave their homes."" ""They do not want to leave the communities they have known their entire lives; the church they go to every Sunday, the park they take their children to, their friends, their family, their community. I do believe they leave only when they feel they must."" Harris then drew a link between the influx of migration and climate change. ""I""m thinking about people whose homes have been washed away by hurricanes, people who are parents who have sons who have been threatened by drug cartels, people who have daughters who have been targeted by human traffickers, people who do not have enough to eat, people who are out of work, people who have lost hope. That""s why they leave home and come to the United States. They are suffering. They are in pain. Many are experiencing unimaginable anguish,"" Harris stated. ""We want to help people find hope at home, and so we are focused on addressing both the acute factors and the root causes of migration. I believe this is an important distinction. We must focus on both,"" Harris said. ""First, the acute factors, the catastrophes that are causing people to leave right now; the hurricanes, the pandemic, the drought, and extreme food insecurity. Then there are the long standing issues, the root causes. I""m thinking of corruption, violence and poverty, the lack of economic opportunity, the lack of climate adaptation and climate resilience, the lack of good governance."" Later, Harris said that ""The work from combating corruption to combating climate change will not be easy, and it is not new, and it could not be more important, and it will take all of us, all of us,"" adding that ""The United States cannot do it alone."" As part of her plans, Harris said that she will soon ""meet virtually with the president of Mexico,"" and ""In a month from now, I will visit Guatemala and Mexico."" Harris also said that the United States will ""send an additional $310 million to the region.""

daily_wire|"Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson continued his presidential tease this week when said that he is considering a possible run for office in the near future as part of his ""ambition to unite our country."" Speaking with Willie Geist of Sunday Today in an interview, the ""Fast & Furious"" actor said that he would run for president if he felt there was solid enough public support.  He also described himself as a ""political independent and centrist"" despite the fact that he endorsed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the previous election. ""I have a goal, and an interest and an ambition to unite our country,"" he said. ""If this is what the people want, then I will do that."" ""If the time comes where there is a good amount of people who want to see that happen, then I""m going to consider it,"" he added. Snippets of the interview with Geist aired in April; the full interview did not air until May 2. In the hit show ""Young Rock,"" a fictionalized version of the actor runs for president in 2032.  Though a recent poll showed that 46% of Americans wanted him as president, Dwayne said that he would conduct his own polling to see if the passion for his candidacy was actually there. Johnson said of the poll in April: ""Not sure our Founding Fathers ever envisioned a six-four, bald, tattooed, half-Black, half-Samoan, tequila drinking, pick up truck driving, fanny pack wearing guy joining their club – but if it ever happens it""d be my honor to serve the people.""  Going all the way back to 2016, the ""Fast & Furious"" star has teased possibly running for president. This past February, while speaking with USA Today about ""Young Rock,"" Johnson echoed his 2017 comments to Ellen DeGeneres that he may run for president. ""I would consider a presidential run in the future if that""s what the people wanted,"" he said. ""Truly I mean that, and I""m not flippant in any way with my answer. That would be up to the people…So I would wait, and I would listen. I would have my finger on the pulse, my ear to the ground."" Last September, Johnson labeled himself a ""centrist"" as he endorsed Joe Biden, clarifying that he has voted for both parties while hailing Kamala Harris as a ""certified badass."" ""As a political independent & centrist, I""ve voted for both parties in the past,"" Johnson tweeted. ""In this critical presidential election, I""m endorsing Joe Biden & Kamala Harris. Progress takes courage, humanity, empathy, strength, KINDNESS & RESPECT. We must ALL VOTE."" Upon Biden""s election, Johnson admitted to crying ""manly tears"" over the prospect of Harris being vice president. ""I wanted to shoot this yesterday, when the news broke, but I got a little emotional, admittedly so, I got a little emotional yesterday, manly tears of course, I may have cried a tear or two, or ten, but they were all very manly. All my tears are manly,"" he said. Johnson went on to say that he got emotional because of what he felt his vote ""represented."" ""My vote represented humanity. My vote represented decency,"" he continued. ""It represented the values and the principles of which we teach our little girls. My vote also, for me, represented the importance of just being a good, decent human being.""

daily_wire|"On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki opened her press briefing with a vitriolic attack on the Trump administration, blaming them for the crisis at the Southern border of the United States. She claimed the Trump administration""s ""destructive and chaotic policies"" were responsible for the ""influx of migrants at the border"" and that the influx began under the Trump administration and was ""exacerbated"" by them. Psaki began by stating, ""I wanted to provide a brief update on the situation on our Southern border; after four years of an immigration system rooted in destructive and chaotic policies, President Biden is taking the challenge head-on and is building a fair, orderly and humane immigration system. That""s our objective."" She immediately shifted blame for the crisis onto the Trump administration, snapping, ""After coming into office, our administration immediately jumped into action to address the influx of migrants at the border, something that began during and was exacerbated by the Trump administration. And we wanted to provide a couple of pieces of data you may have seen, but they""ve come out since the last time we had a briefing in here."" ""At the end of March, there were more than 5,000 children in Customs and Border Protection patrol stations,"" she claimed. ""Today, that number is approximately 600. The amount of time children spend in CBP facilities is down by 75%, from 131 hours at the end of March to under 30 hours now. And just yesterday, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it will begin the process of reuniting a number of families who were separated by the policies of the previous administration.""  In contrast to Psaki""s bald-faced attempt to shift blame for the border crisis to the Trump administration, The Daily Wire""s Chrissy Clark, who recently visited the Southern border, wrote: In March, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) encountered more than 172,000 migrants attempting to come into the United States, which is the largest increase in illegal crossings in two decades. Border Patrol agents we spoke with at length told The Daily Wire that the surge in migration began on January 20 — the day President Joe Biden was inaugurated. People on the ground at the border confirmed to The Daily Wire that hundreds of migrants are being stuffed into holding facilities meant for only a few dozen people. A massive tent city in Donna, Texas, houses thousands upon thousands of migrants. The facility is booming with activity and plans are in the works to expand the tent city even more. In March, as reports surfaced that the number of unaccompanied children being held in detention facilities was over 300% higher than previously known, CBS News host Norah O""Donnell said Biden""s border crisis was ""growing larger and more dire by the day,"" adding, ""Tonight, we have got the stunning new numbers. Sources tell CBS News more than 13,000 migrant children who entered the country without their parents are now in U.S. custody. The government says even more adults are being turned back every day."" As The Daily Wire noted, in late March, Fox News reported that the Biden administration was permitting illegal border crossers to be released without scheduling a court date: Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley Sector (RGV) have begun to process and release illegal border crossers who claim asylum without issuing a Notice to Appear (NTA) – allowing them to depart custody without scheduling a court date for a hearing. The unprecedented move places the responsibility of seeking an asylum hearing on the migrants through Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or legal assistance. Former Acting ICE Director Tom Homan said in February that the Biden administration ""designed"" the border crisis. ""They""re bringing millions of people into this country who will now be counted on the census because Joe Biden overturned that, which leads to seats in the House and Electoral College in elections,"" Homan said. ""This is power over public safety, the quest for power over protecting American citizens.""

daily_wire|"During a visit to Tidewater Community College in Portsmouth, Virginia, on Monday, Biden appeared to offer yet another informational blunder regarding his tax proposals. ""I keep hearing in the press, ""Biden""s going to raise your taxes,"""" the president said. ""Anybody making less than $400k a year will not pay a single penny in taxes…""  Left-wing fact-checking outlet, Snopes, commented that ""Biden clearly misspoke when he said people making less than $400,000 ""will not pay a single penny in taxes,"""" and that ""In his past statements on his economic plan, Biden has claimed that people making less than $400,000 ""won""t pay a penny more in taxes."""" As Snopes noted, Biden""s campaign promise to not raise taxes for people making less than $400,000 was included in April""s ""American Families Plan"": In all, the American Families Plan includes $1.8 trillion in investments and tax credits for American families and children over ten years. It consists of about $1 trillion in investments and $800 billion in tax cuts for American families and workers. Alongside the American Families Plan, the President will be proposing a set of measures to make sure that the wealthiest Americans pay their share in taxes, while ensuring that no one making $400,000 per year or less will see their taxes go up. When combined with President Biden""s American Jobs Plan, this legislation will be fully paid for over 15 years, and will reduce deficits over the long term. Biden""s rhetoric on the $400,000 limit, however, has been far more unclear than Snopes is conveying. For example, William McBride, vice president for federal tax and economic policy at the Tax Foundation, questioned whether such a promise is even feasible. ""I challenge you to find an economist who will say that is even possible,"" said McBride, according to CNBC. ""If you raise tax on this taxpayer here, good luck in isolating that effect to just that taxpayer. It""s not actually possible."" In addition, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki has added further confusion to Biden""s tax promise, saying that Biden means ""families,"" rather than individuals. ""Anybody making more than $400,000 will see a small to a significant tax increase,"" Biden told George Stephanopoulos, reported The Wall Street Journal. He added: ""If you make less than $400,000, you won""t see one single penny in additional federal tax."" The Wall Street Journal then reported that ""White House press secretary Jen Psaki later conceded that the $400,000 threshold was for ""families,"" not individuals."" This means that two married individuals, both with incomes lower than $400,000 annually but amounting to more than $400,000 when combined, could see a tax increase — flying in the face of Biden""s campaign ""promise."" ""This is a familiar tax bait and switch,"" The Wall Street Journal continued. ""Democrats promise they""ll tax only the rich, but there aren""t enough rich, and the rich don""t have enough money to finance the Democratic Party""s endless spending schemes. Millions of the Americans Mr. Biden wants to tax aren""t rich. They are successful Americans, typically at the peak of their earning lives, who might make $200,000 for a few years.""

daily_wire|"President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden sat down with former President Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn during a visit last week to Georgia, but a photo from the get-together has suddenly set social media afire. In the snapshot, the Bidens are kneeling next to two comfy chairs that hold Jimmy, 96, and Rosalynn, 93. Joe, 78, and Jill, 69, look like giants, while the Carters look like lilliputians. The Carter Center on Monday released the photo of the couples — with no one wearing a mask — after the Bidens"" visit to the Carters"" home in Plains, Georgia, last Thursday. ""We""re pleased to share this wonderful photo from the @POTUS and @FLOTUS visit to see the Carters in Plains, Ga.! Thank you President and Mrs. Biden!,"" the center wrote in a tweet Monday night.  Twitter users went to town on the odd photo. ""I""ve been staring at this photo for three hours. I""ve got to go to bed. Back at it tomorrow,"" wrote Joe Seiders. ""Filing under ""why we don""t use the ultrawide lens indoors"","" journalist Jared Holt wrote. ""We voted for Biden because he""s a decent human being with sound policies but also because he and Jill are giants who will crush you if you make them angry,"" posted one user. Said another: ""Glad I""m not the only who noticed. I know it probably has something to do with the angle this photo was shot and that people do tend to shrink as they age, but the Bidens look gargantuan next to the Carters. In any event, God bless the Carters and the Bidens."" Another said the photographer was to blame. ""My guess is the room was very small, so they had to use a wide angle lens to get everyone in. The choice of lens was correct, but someone should""ve fixed the distortion in photoshop before releasing it,"" wrote another Twitterer. One said: ""These four are adorable but this is a perfect example why to avoid photographing portraits with a super wide lens. Anything on the edges will appear huge due to lens distortion. Must have been a very small room and no other option."" Still another said: ""Here""s a quick example of removing the extreme lens distortion. A wide angle lens causes everything on the outer edges of the image to expand, and center to contract — the small room made a wide angle lens necessary.""  Another offered their own fix.  Others noted how it was odd Joe Biden didn""t wear a mask with such elderly people. ""The comments on this distorted photo are hysterical, but the fact that President Biden wears a mask when he""s alone on a Zoom call with world leaders but he doesn""t when he""s sitting with the Carters, a couple in their 90s, only proves that post vaccine masks are pure theater,"" wrote a user.  ""No mask? But they""ve been wearying sic masks EVERYWHERE, so why not with this very elderly, very vulnerable couple?"" wrote another.

daily_wire|"Former President George W. Bush says the Republican Party can""t win if it becomes just a ""white Anglo-Saxon Protestantism"" party. Bush, who has reappeared in the public forum as he promotes his new pro-immigration book ""Out of Many, One: Portraits of America""s Immigrants,"" says the GOP needs to bring in a more diverse group of supporters if it wants to return to power. ""If your Republican Party stands for exclusivity — you know, it used to be country clubs, now evidently it""s white Anglo-Saxon Protestantism — then it""s not going to win anything,"" Bush said in a recent interview with The Dispatch podcast. ""My whole point on all this immigration debate and stuff is, I think if we valued life as precious and every life matters, that we""re all God""s children, that all of a sudden the tone of the debate might be a little better,"" Bush told hosts Sarah Isgur, a GOP former Department of Justice spokeswoman, and Steven Hayes, the ex-editor-in-chief of The Weekly Standard, on Thursday. ""I mean, I was discouraged when I saw some of the language associated with immigrants and wanted to present a different side,"" the 43rd president, 74, said in the interview. Isgur asked Bush whether he would remain a member of the GOP if the party follows the same path for the next three to five years. ""No I""d say there""s not going to be a party,"" Bush said. ""You know, to me that basically says that we want to be extinct."" But he said he is still ""proudly"" a Republican and expressed cautious optimism that the party can return to power. ""I think Republicans will have a second chance to govern, because I believe that the Biden administration is a uniting factor, and particularly on the fiscal side of things. So, you know, we""ll see,"" he said. Bush""s remarks came days after he warned that President Joe Biden""s decision to pull all American troops from Afghanistan could hurt women and girls if the ""brutal"" Taliban returns to power. ""My first reaction was, wow, these girls are going to have real trouble with the Taliban,"" Bush said last week on NBC""s ""Today."" ""A lot of gains have been made, and so I""m deeply concerned about the plight of women and girls in that country."" ""I think the administration hopes that the girls are going be OK through diplomacy. We""ll find out. All I know is the Taliban, when they had the run of the place, they were brutal,"" Bush said. The war in Afghanistan began on October 7, 2001, less than a month after the September 11 attacks. But despite campaign pledges by Barack Obama in his first run for the White House — as well as Donald Trump — neither ever fully withdrew U.S. troops from the war-torn nation. The war has cost more than $2.2 trillion, according to one analysis conducted by Brown University""s Watson Institute of International and Public Affairs. Biden said on April 24 that the events of 9/11 ""cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021."" Biden also said he spoke to Bush before announcing the move. ""I spoke yesterday with President Bush to inform him of my decision,"" Biden said. ""While he and I have had many disagreements over policy throughout the years, we""re absolutely united in our respect and support for the valor, the courage, and integrity of the women and men in the United States Armed Forces who served, and immensely grateful for the bravery and backbone they have shown through nearly two decades of combat deployments.""

daily_wire|"Speaking at the Washington Conference on the Americas, Vice President Kamala Harris, despite the fact that in 2019 as a presidential candidate she reportedly would not rule out packing the Supreme Court with additional justices, and still has not done so, pontificated that ""an independent judiciary is critical to a healthy democracy and a strong economy."" Harris also posited that some of the ""root causes"" of the vast number of immigrants flooding the Southern border included the ""lack of climate adaption and climate resilience."" Harris opined, ""So we want to help. Our administration wants to help. We want to pick back up the kind of work President Joe Biden started when he was vice-president. We want to help people find hope at home. And so, we are focused on addressing both the acute factors and the root causes of migration. And I believe this is an important distinction: we must focus on both. First, the acute factors, the catastrophes that are causing people to leave right now: the hurricanes, the pandemic, the drought, and extreme food insecurity."" ""And then there are the long-standing issues, the root causes,"" she continued. ""And I""m thinking of corruption, violence, and poverty. The lack of economic opportunity. The lack of climate adaption and climate resilience. The lack of good governance."" Then Harris segued to her contention that a healthy democracy needed an independent judiciary, saying, ""Just this weekend we learned that the Salvadoran parliament moved to undermine its nation""s highest court. An independent judiciary is critical to a healthy democracy and a strong economy."" Politico reported in March 2019, when Harris was still running for the Democratic presidential nomination, ""Sens. Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand told POLITICO they would not rule out expanding the Supreme Court if elected president, showcasing a new level of interest in the Democratic field on an issue that has until recently remained on the fringes of debate."" Harris stated, ""We are on the verge of a crisis of confidence in the Supreme Court. We have to take this challenge head on, and everything is on the table to do that."" During their vice-presidential debate last October, former Vice President Mike Pence asked Harris flat-out if she supported packing the Supreme Court. He stated: When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer, Senator Harris. Are you and Joe Biden going to pack the court if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? I mean, there""ve been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years from George Washington to Barack Obama. Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases, but your party is actually openly advocating, adding seats to the Supreme court, which has had nine seats for 150 years if you don""t get your way. This is a classic case of if you can""t win by the rules, you""re going to change the rules. Now you""ve refused to answer the question. Joe Biden has refused to answer the question — you""ve refused to answer the question. Joe Biden has refused to answer the question. So I think the American people would really like to know if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed at the Supreme Court of the United States. Are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the Supreme Court to get your way? Harris dodged answering the question, and sidestepped this way: In 1864, one of the, I think political heroes, certainly the President, I assume you also, Mr. Vice President, is Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was up for reelection and it was 27 days before the election. And a seat became open on the United States Supreme Court. Abraham Lincoln""s party was in charge, not only of the White House, but the Senate. But Honest Abe said, ""It""s not the right thing to do. The American people deserve to make the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And then that person can select who will serve for a lifetime on the highest court of our land."" And so Joe and I are very clear: the American people are voting right now and it should be their decision about who will serve on this most important body for a lifetime. Pence doggedly pursued her, asking, ""People … are voting right now. They""d like to know if you and Joe Biden are going to pack the Supreme Court if you don""t get your way in this nomination. You, once again, gave a non-answer. Joe Biden gave a non-answer. … You know the people deserve a straight answer, and if you haven""t figured it out yet, the straight answer is they are going to pack the Supreme Court if they somehow win this election. Men and women, I got to tell you people across this country, if you cherish our Supreme Court, if you cherish the separation of powers, you need to reject the Biden Harris ticket come November the third, reelect President Donald Trump, and we""ll stand by that separation powers in a nine seats Supreme Court."" Harris continued dodging, saying, ""Let""s talk about packing the court then. Let""s talk about the fact. … So the Trump Pence administration has been, because I sit on the Senate judiciary committee, Susan as you mentioned, and I""ve witnessed the appointments for lifetime appointments to the federal courts, district courts, courts of appeal, people who are purely ideological, people who have been reviewed by legal professional organizations and found who have been not competent are substandard. And do you know that of the 50 people who President Trump appointed to the court of appeals for lifetime appointments, not one is black? This is what they""ve been doing. You want to talk about packing a court? Let""s have that discussion."" In April, President Biden issued an executive order to create a Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States that would ""examine include the genesis of the reform debate; the Court""s role in the Constitutional system; the length of service and turnover of justices on the Court; the membership and size of the Court; and the Court""s case selection, rules, and practices.""

daily_wire|"So-called nonpartisan fact-checking outlet PolitiFact spent President Joe Biden""s first 100 days defending the president from inaccurate Facebook posts instead of fact-checking his numerous falsehoods. A report from the right-leaning Media Research Center found that PolitiFact was eight times more likely to defend Biden than to fact-check him in his first 100 days, a vast difference from how the outlet treated former President Donald Trump. For Trump""s first 100 days, ""PolitiFact offered 52 fact checks with a ""Truth-O-Meter"" ruling of Donald Trump in his first 100 days (January 20 to April 30, 2017), while in the same period this year, PolitiFact offered just 13 fact checks of President Biden,"" the MRC found. As the MRC noted, ""the media insist Trump""s in his own category on truth and falsehood,"" so the outlet decided to see how often PolitiFact defended Biden as opposed to fact-checking him. The MRC found that for Biden""s first 100 days, PolitiFact fact-checked Biden just 13 times while it defended him from claims made about him 106 times. ""In other words, they""re much more sensitive about someone ""lying"" about Biden than they are about Biden lying,"" the MRC reported. ""Many of the fact checks about Biden are about ""Facebook Posts,"" ""Viral Images,"" or ""Tweets."" Those rulings often translate into content warnings. But there were two ""Pants on Fire"" rulings for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and one each for Fox News and for Tucker Carlson. Liz Cheney got the Flaming Pants for insisting that less than six percent of Biden""s infrastructure package is about infrastructure."" Surprisingly, the MRC""s report found that even though PolitiFact chose to fact-check Biden far less than it did Trump, the percentage of falsehoods between the two presidents was about the same. ""Perhaps the surprising measurement here is that the percentage of PolitiFact ""Truth-O-Meter"" rating of Biden and Trump were the same – 61.5 percent. Trump just had four times as many evaluations. Thirty-two of 52 Trump evaluations were defined as ""Mostly False,"" ""False,"" or ""Pants on Fire."" Eight of 13 Biden evaluations landed on the False side. Biden had zero ""Pants on Fire"" ratings in the first 100 days. In 2017, Trump had two,"" the MRC found. The fact checks about Biden, however, were overwhelmingly found by PolitiFact to be false, with 91 out of 106 total (which includes pages other than the one simply labeled ""Fact Checks About Biden"") labeled as ""Mostly False"" or worse. That""s an 86% false rating for what PolitiFact chose to fact check. ""There were 24 ""Pants on Fire"" ratings for Biden critics, 45 ""False"" ratings, and 22 ""Mostly False."" Ten were ""Half True,"" three were ""Mostly True"" and two were ""True,"""" the MRC reported. ""Overall, Biden""s PolitiFact page shows he""s been put on the ""Truth-O-Meter"" 169 times in the website""s history beginning in 2007, and was found to be on the True/Mostly True side 67 times (almost 40 percent) and Mostly False or worse 78 times (46 percent).

blaze|"On the latest episode of ""The Rubin Report,"" BlazeTV host Dave Rubin talks about Jimmy Kimmel's racist and uninformed remarks after Republican Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.) said America is not a racist country during his rebuttal to President Joe Biden's address to a joint session of Congress.   Kimmel attempted to smear Sen. Scott and conservatives by implying that the Republican Party is racist because he is the only black GOP senator, apparently without realizing that the Democratic Party has only two black senators. Dave played a clip of Kimmel taunting Scott by saying, ""An amazing thing happened after the speech. Every black Republican senator got together to let the American people know the Republican party isn't racist ... and then Tim promptly returned to the sensory deprivation egg he calls home. Sen. Scott accused Democrats, in his rebuttal, of using race as a weapon, when the truth is we're more concerned about people using weapons as a weapon. Race would be a terrible weapon. What would you do, melanin a person to death?""   Dave called Kimmel's blunder ""a true indicator of the modern pernicious racism of the left,"" adding that the late-night host's views exemplify the ""liberal, elite, modern, woke, progressive, racist view of the world.""

blaze|"A recent photograph of President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden alongside former President Jimmy Carter and former First Lady Rosalynn Carter has folks on social media scratching their heads over whether the Bidens are giants, the Carters have shrunk, or something else is amiss.   The Bidens met with the Carters last week at the former first couple's home in Georgia, where the picture was snapped. The Carter Center tweeted out the image on Monday, writing, ""We're pleased to share this wonderful photo from the @POTUS and @FLOTUS visit to see the Carters in Plains, Ga.! Thank you President and Mrs. Biden!"" But the picture left several people on Twitter wondering: ""Dude what is with the size difference between these people what the hell is going on here?"" One person wrote, ""Glad I'm not the only who noticed. I know it probably has something to do with the angle this photo was shot and that people do tend to shrink as they age, but the Bidens look gargantuan next to the Carters.""   Another added, ""Regardless of it being edited or not it's hilarious people are trying to defend a picture where the Bidens look like they showed up for a tea party in the Carters' Barbie house."" An expert for The Guardian explained that the Bidens are not, in reality, three times the size of the Carters, telling the outlet: The size distortions are not the only thing people noticed about the photo of the Democratic couples. Many respondents noted that the Bidens — who still insist on wearing masks outdoors despite being fully vaccinated for months — were nonetheless comfortable ditching their masks to pose next to an elderly couple indoors. ""The comments on this distorted photo are hysterical,"" one person wrote, ""but the fact that President Biden wears a mask when he's alone on a Zoom call with world leaders but he doesn't when he's sitting with the Carters, a couple in their 90s, only proves that post vaccine masks are pure theater."" Another replied, ""Where are the masks. Not social distanced. I noticed the Bidens donned theirs as they were leaving. More mixed messages."""
blaze|"A Democratic Party leader in Texas has resigned following outrage after he publicly used a racial slur in referring to African American Republican Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.).   Sen. Scott delivered the GOP retort to President Joe Biden's first speech before a joint session of Congress last week, wherein he declared that America is ""not a racist country."" Afterward, the Republican received waves of racist abuse online from leftists. Texas' Lamar County Democratic Party chair Gary O'Connor joined in on the attacks, writing in a now-deleted Facebook post, ""I had hoped that Scott might show some common sense, but it seems clear he is little more than an oreo with no real principles."" As TheBlaze previously noted, ""by calling Scott an 'oreo,' O'Connor was suggesting that Scott — the lone black U.S. senator — is black on the outside, but white on the inside."" O'Connor was hit with a flurry of calls for him to resign over the post, and he has now stepped down.   ""I am deeply and sincerely sorry for my inappropriate and hurtful use of the racist term I used to describe Sen. Tim Scott on my personal Facebook page,"" O'Connor told The Washington Examiner on Tuesday. ""It was insensitive, and I have embarrassed myself and my party by its use."" He added, ""As a result, I feel compelled to offer my resignation as chair of the Lamar County Democratic Party for consideration by the County Executive Committee."" Following Scott's response to Biden's speech, the term ""Uncle Tim"" trended on Twitter for several hours, after countless progressives used the play on the racist term ""Uncle Tom"" to refer to the Republican senator. Fox News noted that ""Congressional Democrats — whose platform vehemently opposes racism — have remained silent on the slur targeting Scott that trended amongst their voting base."" Over the weekend, Scott denounced the racist attacks made against him, telling CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" ""Fighting bigotry with bigotry is hypocrisy."" ""The question we should be debating and fighting over is: How do we resolve those issues going forward?"" he said. ""One side says, 'I'm going to take from some to give to others.' Our side, what I've suggested, is: Let's expand opportunity and make sure that we are fully equipped for the challenges of the future."""

But now, President Joe Biden's ""Made in America Tax Plan"" seeks to raise taxes on the ""super rich"" to fund his unprecedented socialist spending spree, while claiming that his plan won't touch you, the average American. On a recent episode of ""LevinTV, "" BlazeTV host and author of ""American Marxism"" Mark Levin said Biden's new tax plan is really a ""Marxist magic trick,"" and the target of this trick is you and everything you've worked for. ""This is a direct attack on the middle class,"" Levin stated, going on to explain how Biden's tax plan to pay for his $2 trillion ""infrastructure"" bill will dramatically affect things like property ownership and inheritance, as well as family businesses, ranches, or farms.   ""If you understand Marxism, if you understand the Democrat Party, you'll understand they want you to follow the shiny object of the super rich,"" Mark said. ""But if you're a working person — maybe you have a farm, you have a ranch, maybe a couple of homes, maybe you've managed to live the American dream, in other words most of the people we call the middle class — you're going to get killed.

blaze|"CNN anchor and chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper questioned on Tuesday whether Republican politicians who he characterized as ""cowardly"" followers of former President Donald Trump should be given airtime.   During an interview with colleagues on CNN's ""New Day"" morning program, Tapper went on a lengthy tirade against what he called the Republican Party's embrace of ""downright lies"" and conspiracies as they relate to claims of election fraud and President Joe Biden's progressive agenda. ""If they're willing to lie about Joe Biden wanting to steal your hamburgers, and QAnon and the Big Lie about the election, what are they not willing to lie about?"" Tapper said. ""Why should I put any of them on TV? ""It's remarkable that standing up for basic facts is now controversial within the Republican Party,"" Tapper claimed in the interview, later making specific reference to Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) and Republican House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (La.).   ""The lie about the election on its own is anti-democracy, and it is sowing seeds of ignorance in the populous, and obviously has the potential to incite violence,"" he said. ""But beyond that is, if you're willing to lie about that, what are you not willing to lie about? That's where we are when it comes to the House Republican leadership, McCarthy and Scalise, and where we are with too many leaders of the Republican Party — they're not willing to tell their voters the truth.""  ""I happen to believe that this country needs a strong, thriving, healthy, fact-based Republican Party,"" Tapper continued, claiming that for the country to succeed, healthy debate needs to happen. ""But we can't have those debates if one side ... is not willing to stick to standards and facts."" TheBlaze reached out to CNN regarding Tapper's remarks, specifically questioning whether the network is considering barring certain members of GOP leadership from making appearances, but has not yet received a response. The Hill, in its coverage of the news, noted that in December, Tapper admitted that he had a policy of never booking former Trump White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany or Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller on his show. ""There are some people that are so mendacious, I just wouldn't put them on air,"" he reportedly. ""Kayleigh McEnany, I never booked her. Jason Miller from the Trump campaign, I would never book him. These are just people who tell lies the way that most people breathe. There was no value in that."""
blaze|"President Joe Biden announced Monday a fourfold increase in annual United States refugee admissions this year, capitulating to liberal critics who had criticized Biden for not increasing the cap sooner.   Biden took heavy fire from Democrats after he refused to increase the number of refugees the U.S. would admit this year. In fact, Biden signed an order maintaining a limit of 15,000, which was established under former President Donald Trump. Democrats accused Biden of breaking his campaign promise to significantly increase Trump-era refugee limits. ""Completely and utterly unacceptable. Biden promised to welcome immigrants, and people voted for him based on that promise. Upholding the xenophobic and racist policies of the Trump admin, incl the historically low + plummeted refugee cap, is flat out wrong. Keep your promise,"" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said, ""It is simply unacceptable and unconscionable that the Biden Administration is not immediately repealing Donald Trump's harmful, xenophobic, and racist refugees cap that cruelly restricts admissions to a historically low level ... President Biden has broken his promise to restore our humanity.""   In a dramatic reversal, Biden announced Monday he was revising the annual refugee cap to 62,500 for the current fiscal year and promised to raise the limit to 125,000 for the upcoming 2022 fiscal year. ""This erases the historically low number set by the previous administration of 15,000, which did not reflect America's values as a nation that welcomes and supports refugees,"" Biden said. Biden first promised to raise the cap to 62,500 in February, which made last month's announcement even more confusing for Democrats. Contextually, however, it came as Biden was being criticized for the growing migrant crisis at the southern U.S. border. Taking more shots at Trump, Biden revealed the impact of the admissions cap increase is immediate. ""So we are going to rebuild what has been broken and push hard to complete the rigorous screening process for those refugees already in the pipeline for admission,"" Biden said. ""The sad truth is that we will not achieve 62,500 admissions this year. We are working quickly to undo the damage of the last four years. It will take some time, but that work is already underway,"" he added. ""We have reopened the program to new refugees. And by changing the regional allocations last month, we have already increased the number of refugees ready for departure to the United States."" Biden has made comprehensive immigration reform a central part of his presidential plan. On his first day in office, Biden proposed an ambitious plan that, among other things, would create a pathway to citizenship for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally as well as provide assistance for increased migrant integration into society. According to the New York Times, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) is exploring unique legislative avenues to enact Biden's immigration agenda, including using the budget reconciliation process. If permitted, the process would allow Democrats to pass immigration reform with a simple majority of 51 votes."
blaze|"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) says President Joe Biden can expect ""zero"" Senate Republicans to sign on to the administration's $4 trillion behemoth of an infrastructure package, saying it costs too much and has ""a whole lot of other stuff"" in it beyond its purported purpose.   Speaking during a news conference in Kentucky on Monday, the GOP leader said, ""I think it's worth talking about but I don't think there will be any Republican support — none, zero — for the $4.1 trillion grab bag which has infrastructure in it but a whole lot of other stuff."" Biden has proposed breaking up the infrastructure package into two pieces: A $2.3 trillion jobs package and a $1.8 trillion families package. """"We're open to doing a roughly $600 billion package which deals with what all of us agree is infrastructure,"" McConnell said. ""If it's going to be about infrastructure, let's make it about infrastructure.""   Some Senate Democrats have taken to expanding the definition of infrastructure in their bid to sell Biden's plan to the American public, with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) declaring on Twitter that paid leave, child care, and caregiving are all ""infrastructure."" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) have both emphasized the need to address ""human infrastructure."" The Hill reported that ""a group of Senate Republicans, led by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), have proposed a $568 billion package,"" noting ""Biden and Capito talked late last week, both expressing an interest to keep negotiating and potentially setting up another White House meeting."" But Democrats and Republicans are far apart on what they are willing to spend on the package — and NBC News reported that some Democrats are losing patience, looking to move forward without a bipartisan agreement. The outlet reported: If Democrats all rally behind the White House's plan, the package could be passed through reconciliation via a simple majority in the 50-50 Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris as the tie-breaking vote."
blaze|"Although he declined to mention any specific public figure by name, San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone delivered a scathing rebuke to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), President Joe Biden, and other prominent pro-choice Catholics in a recent missive about the evils of abortion.   In the pastoral letter issued Saturday and titled, ""Before I Formed You in the Womb I Knew You,"" Cordileone took prominent Catholics who support abortion to task for their promotion of an act that the church holds to be a grave sin. ""Prominent figures in society help to shape the mores of that society, and in our culture their advocacy of abortion definitely leads others to do evil,"" Cordileone wrote. ""This must be stated with clarity: anyone who actively works to promote abortion shares some of the guilt for the abortions performed because of their actions."" Pelosi, a high-profile Catholic who represents San Francisco residents in the U.S. House, has long-supported abortion in spite of the fact that it runs afoul of her church's teaching. After all, it is undoubtedly a winning issue for her politically in liberal San Francisco, and just as well, she has never faced religious discipline for it.   But Cordileone wants that to change. In his letter, the conservative archbishop argued that it is the responsibility of church leadership to ""correct Catholics who erroneously, and sometimes stubbornly, promote abortion."" In this case by denying them Communion, the church's holiest sacrament. ""Because we are dealing with public figures and public examples of cooperation in moral evil, this correction can also take the public form of exclusion from the reception of Holy Communion,"" the archbishop said. ""When other avenues are exhausted, the only recourse a pastor has left is the public medicine of temporary exclusion from the Lord's Table. This is a bitter medicine, but the gravity of the evil of abortion can sometimes warrant it,"" he added. Cordileone's letter is the latest entry in an evolving debate the Catholic Church is having around how to handle Catholic politicians who adopt stances contrary to the teachings of the church, the Washington Post reported. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops are set to gather in June to vote on whether or not to draft a document on the Communion issue, though there have been numerous conflicting reports coming from within the organization about what exactly the document will look like. Pressure is surely mounting as any forthcoming decision about Communion is bound to have far-reaching consequences. In fact, it could reach as far as the White House. President Biden, who regularly attends Catholic Mass, is also a vocal proponent of abortion access. For Cordileone, however, the issue is rather simple. ""Abortion is the axe laid to the roots of the tree of human rights: when our culture encourages the violation of life at its youngest and most vulnerable condition, other ethical norms cannot stand for long,"" he wrote in the introduction to his letter. ""Our responsibility to the rest of the Catholic community is to assure them that the Church of Jesus Christ does take most seriously her mission to care for 'the least of these,'"" he added."
blaze|"Former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic nominee for president Hillary Clinton raised concerns over President Joe Biden's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, warning of ""two huge consequences"" of leaving the war-torn region in an interview Sunday.   The first consequence is ""the potential collapse of the Afghan government and a takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban,"" Clinton said. She warned that civil war might resume in the country if American troops leave, a concern shared by U.S. commanders in the region who opposed the withdrawal over fears the Taliban could overrun Afghan armed forces without American military support. Clinton added that the United States has an obligation to protect ""many thousands of Afghans"" who worked with the U.S. and NATO, those who ""stood up and spoke out for women's rights and human rights."" ""I hope that the administration in concert with the Congress will have a very large visa program and will begin immediately to try to provide that channel for so many Afghans to utilize so that they are not left in danger,"" she said, predicting a ""huge refugee outflow"" if Afghanistan spirals into civil war.   The second major consequence of U.S. withdrawal, according to Clinton, is the ""resumption of activities by global terrorist groups, most particularly Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State."" Acknowledging that there has been a ""sharp drop in both capacity and action on behalf of Islamic terrorist groups,"" Clinton said she wouldn't count on that ""downward spiral"" lasting if the Taliban retakes power and provides refuge for Islamic terrorist groups. ""The Taliban has never been willing to separate itself from Al-Qaeda,"" Clinton pointed out. ""It's one thing to pull out troops that have been supporting security in Afghanistan, supporting the Afghan military, leaving it pretty much to fend for itself, but we can't afford to walk away from the consequences of that decision,"" Clinton concluded. The United States officially began to withdraw American troops from Afghanistan last week, with President Joe Biden's ultimate goal being a complete exit from the country by Sept. 11 — commemorating the 20-year-anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. Biden's timetable for withdrawal broke an agreement between the Trump administration and the Taliban to have American military forces leave Afghanistan by May 1. In response, the Taliban said Friday it will ""take every counteraction it deems appropriate against the occupying forces,"" possibly signaling new attacks on U.S. forces as they attempt to leave the country."

breitbart|"President Joe Biden was unable to say Monday whether America could achieve herd immunity from the coronavirus, but urged everyone to get the vaccine anyway.

The website, which already details 40 hostile actions from Biden toward Catholics, is only the start of an extensive campaign to tie the Biden-Harris administration""s failures to many of the key races in the 2022 midterms. For example, an entry for April 28 described Psaki""s statement that Biden ""respectfully disagrees"" with the U.S. bishops on the issue of using the bodies of aborted babies for scientific research. Another entry, on April 26, noted the Biden administration""s withdrawal of a proposed Trump administration rule that would have had single-sex homeless shelters accept residents based on male/female sex, and not gender identity.

breitbart|"On a sunny Friday afternoon at Amtrak""s 30th Street Station, President Joe Biden delivered remarks outside without a mask while wearing a blue ball cap. When he finished his speech, the president stepped away from the podium without his mask, approaching a fellow official, and spoke to him briefly before fist-bumping him in the chest. ""You ready?"" he asked two of his granddaughters before walking slowly down the station platform without his face covering, arm-in-arm with one of them.  Biden""s behavior at the Amtrak event appeared completely defendable under the new CDC guidelines for vaccinated Americans. He shed his mask at a small crowd of presumably vaccinated local government and Amtrak officials gathered outside on the platform and walked outside with his granddaughters Maisy and Finnegan. But a day earlier, the president awkwardly fumbled for his mask after speaking at an outdoor drive-in car rally speech in Georgia. After calling up Sen. Raphael Warnock and Sen. Jon Ossoff to the stage, First Lady Jill Biden approached and pointed at her own mask to remind her husband to put his mask back on. As Jackie Wilson""s ""High and Higher"" blared through the outdoor speakers Biden repeatedly flipped through his binder of papers looking for his lost mask. He continued looking around the podium for his mask, apologizing to two approaching senators for losing his mask. Leaning into the microphone, Biden apologized to the crowd, ""I""m looking for my mask. I""m in trouble."" Jill Biden took her husband""s binder and began flipping through it herself, before giving up. As Wilson crooned, ""I""m so glad, I finally found you,"" Biden discovered his mask in his pocket and held it up triumphantly — a split second before an aide ran on stage to offer him a replacement. The president put on his mask and greeted the newly minted Georgia Democrats as Jill Biden gathered them all together to hold hands and raise their arms in celebration. Turning back to the podium, Biden pulled down his mask and leaned into the microphone. ""Go Georgia! We need you!"" Putting his mask back on, Biden double-pointed out at the crowd before taking the first lady""s hand and leaving the stage. But three days earlier, Biden explained to reporters at an outdoor event at the White House he would walk away from the podium without his mask to model the CDC""s new outdoor mask guidance ""by watching me take it off and not put it back on until I get inside."" But in a TODAY interview aired Friday, Biden said would continue to wear his mask outdoors just to be safe, despite the updated guidance from federal health officials. ""It""s a small precaution to take that has a profound impact,"" Biden explained to the socially distanced Craig Melvin in the interview. ""It""s a patriotic responsibility for God""s sake."" Since he first took office in January, Biden made ""mask-signaling"" a priority — but it was immediately clear there was no consistent message from the White House. The president stood on Inauguration Day with his extended family for a photo at the Lincoln Monument, hours after signing an executive order ordering all Americans to wear masks on federal property. It was the first executive order of his presidency, Biden explained, speaking through his mask while seated at the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. But after signing the order, Biden abandoned the concept of keeping his mask on while speaking on federal property in the White House. The president makes a point of showing up at every event wearing his mask and removing it at the podium, before speaking. But he frequently forgets to put his mask back on after speaking, at times apologetically returning to the podium to retrieve the covering. First Lady Kamala Harris, at one point, had to remind the president to put his mask back on at a coronavirus event with health officials. Even the Easter Bunny costume was fitted with a gigantic red mask as President Joe Biden and Jill Biden stood on the South Portico to celebrate Easter, hundreds of feet away from any other individual.  As Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke at Biden""s virtual climate summit, Biden was the only world leader onscreen wearing a mask. White House press secretary Jen Psaki explained Biden was ""sending a message to the world"" about the importance of masking. But by day two of the summit, Biden was spotted at times without his mask as he sat at the table with administration officials to talk about the threat that climate change posed to the world. The president continues insisting wearing a mask is a ""patriotic duty"" to fellow Americans, sternly lecturing Republican officials for ""Neanderthal thinking"" by lifting mask mandates in their states. But as Americans are growing tired of wearing their masks, Republicans are starting to point out the president""s own thinking on masking. ""Joe and Jill Biden are FULLY vaccinated,"" the Republican National Committee wrote on Twitter Friday. ""Why are they ignoring CDC guidance on wearing masks outside?"""
breitbart|"President Joe Biden expressed disappointment Monday that coronavirus cases are once again rising, urging states to pause reopening efforts and reinstate mask mandates. ""I""m reiterating my call for every governor, mayor, and local leader to maintain and reinstate the mask mandate,"" Biden said at the White House. ""Please, this is not politics. Reinstate the mandate if you let it down."" Biden offered Americans a message of both hope and doom. His speech promoted progress in getting the country vaccinated but also warned of impending spikes in cases and hospitalizations. About seventeen states, led by Republican governors, have either lifted their mask mandates or never enacted them, including highly populated states in Florida and Texas. ""Mask up. Mask up. It""s a patriotic duty. It""s the only way we get back to normal,"" he said. Joe Biden even urged private businesses to continue requiring that customers wear masks.
He pointed to a warning of ""impending doom"" from Centers for Disease Control Director Rochelle Walensky earlier Monday, urging Americans to keep following coronavirus restrictions and guidelines. ""This is deadly serious,"" Biden said, and added, ""The failure to take this virus seriously is what precisely got us into this mess in the first place. Biden also condemned Americans who continued to travel and party during spring break, predicting a spike of cases as a result. ""New variants are spreading, and sadly, some of the reckless behavior we""ve seen on television over the past few weeks means that more new cases are to come in the weeks ahead,"" he said.

slate|"Also in Slate: Shmuel Rosner examined the ""erratic pragmatism"" of Biden""s Middle East policy. Jack Shafer called Biden ""the unusually creepy kind"" of plagiarist. Teachers and scholars consider the unattributed use of someone else""s words and ideas to be a very serious offense, but the public doesn""t seem to mind much, at least when it comes to politics. The incidents of plagiarism and fabrication that forced Joe Biden to quit the 1988 presidential race have drawn little comment since his selection as Barack Obama""s vice presidential running mate—just as revelations of plagiarism by Stephen Ambrose and Doris Kearns Goodwin scarcely hurt their book sales. In 1987, before Biden quit the race, he called the incidents ""a tempest in a teapot."" Although most reporters disagreed then, at least enough to pursue the story, they seem now—perhaps jaded by two decades of scandal-mongering—to have come around to Biden""s view. But Biden""s exit from the 1988 race is worth recalling in detail, because his transgressions far exceeded Obama""s own relatively innocent lifting of rhetorical set pieces from his friend Deval Patrick, which occasioned a brief flap last February. Biden""s misdeeds encompassed numerous self-aggrandizing thefts, misstatements, and exaggerations that seemed to point to a serious character defect. In some ways, the 1988 campaign—in which scandal forced not just Biden but also Gary Hart from the race—marked a watershed in the absurd gotcha politics that have since marred our politics and punditry. But unlike Hart""s plight, Biden""s can""t be blamed on an overly intrusive or hectoring press corps. The press was right to dig into this one. In the 1988 race, Biden began as a long shot. But after Hart dropped out in May 1987 over the exposure of his affair with Donna Rice, none of the remaining ""seven dwarves"" in the Democratic field pulled away from the pack. Biden""s youth and vitality—as well as his tutelage by Patrick Caddell, the pollster-consultant considered a veritable magician by insiders—made him a decent bet to reach the front of the pack. Over the summer, the rival campaigns of Michael Dukakis and Dick Gephardt became concerned as Biden ticked upward in the polls. Biden""s downfall began when his aides alerted him to a videotape of the British Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock, who had run unsuccessfully against Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The tape showed Kinnock delivering a powerful speech about his rise from humble roots. Taken by the performance, Biden adapted it for his own stump speech. Biden, after all, was the son of a car salesman, a working-class kid made good. Kinnock""s material fit with the story he was trying to sell. At first Biden would credit Kinnock when he quoted him. But at some point he failed to offer the attribution. Biden maintained that he lapsed only once—at a debate at the Iowa State Fair, on Aug. 23, when cameras recorded it—but Maureen Dowd of the New York Times reported two incidents of nonattribution, and no one kept track exactly of every time Biden used the Kinnock bit. (Click here for examples of Biden""s lifting.) What is certain is that Biden didn""t simply borrow the sort of boilerplate that counts as common currency in political discourse—phrases like ""fighting for working families."" What he borrowed was Kinnock""s life. Biden lifted Kinnock""s precise turns of phrase and his sequences of ideas—a degree of plagiarism that would qualify any student for failure, if not expulsion from school. But the even greater sin was to borrow biographical facts from Kinnock that, although true about Kinnock, didn""t apply to Biden. Unlike Kinnock, Biden wasn""t the first person in his family history to attend college, as he asserted; nor were his ancestors coal miners, as he claimed when he used Kinnock""s words. Once exposed, Biden""s campaign team managed to come up with a great-grandfather who had been a mining engineer, but he hardly fit the candidate""s description of one who ""would come up from the mines after 12 hours and play football."" At any rate, Biden had delivered his offending remarks with an introduction that clearly implied he had come up with them himself and that they pertained to his own life. Most American political reporters were not so attuned to Britain""s politics that they recognized Kinnock""s words. But Michael Dukakis"" adviser John Sasso had seen the Kinnock tape. Without his boss""s knowledge or consent, he prepared a video juxtaposing the two men""s speeches and got it into the hands of Dowd at the Times, David Yepsen of the Des Moines Register, and NBC News. When the story broke on Sept. 12, Biden was gearing up to chair the Supreme Court nomination hearings for Robert Bork, Ronald Reagan""s far-right nominee. Biden angrily denied having done anything wrong and urged the press to chase after the political rival who had sent out what came to be called the ""attack video."" Unfortunately for Biden, more revelations of plagiarism followed, distracting him from the Bork hearings. Over the next days, it emerged that Biden had lifted significant portions of speeches from Robert Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey. From Kennedy, he took four long sentences in one case and two memorable sentences in another. (In one account, Biden said that Pat Caddell had inserted them in his speech without Biden""s knowledge; in another account, the failure to credit RFK was chalked up to the hasty cutting and pasting that went into the speech.) From Humphrey, the hot passage was a particularly affecting appeal for government to help the neediest. Yet another uncited borrowing came from John F. Kennedy. If that wasn""t bad enough, Biden admitted the next day that while in law school he had received an F for a course because he had plagiarized five pages from a published article in a term paper that he submitted. He admitted as well that he had falsely stated that British Labor official Denis Healey had given him the Kinnock tape. (Healey had denied the claim.) And Biden conceded that he had exaggerated in another matter by stating in a speech some years earlier that he had joined sit-ins to desegregate restaurants and movie theaters, and was thus actively involved in the civil rights movement. He protested, his press secretary clarified, ""to desegregate one restaurant and one movie theater."" The latter two of these fibs were small potatoes by any reckoning, but in the context of other acts of dishonesty, they helped to form a bigger picture. For all these disclosures, Biden remained unbowed. ""I""m in the race to stay, I""m in the race to win, and here I come,"" he declared. That meant, of course, that his days were numbered. Newsweek soon reported on a C-SPAN videotape from the previous April that showed Biden berating a heckler at a campaign stop. While lashing out at the audience member, Biden defended his academic credentials by inflating them, in a fashion that was notably unbecoming and petty for a presidential candidate. ""I think I probably have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect,"" Biden sniped at the voter. ""I went to law school on a full academic scholarship."" That claim was false, as was another claim, made in the same rant, that he graduated in the top half of his law-school class. Biden wrongly stated, too, that he had earned three undergraduate degrees, when in fact he had earned one—a double major in history and political science. Another round of press inquiries followed, and Biden finally withdrew from the race on Sept. 23. The sheer number and extent of Biden""s fibs, distortions, and plagiarisms struck many observers at the time as worrisome, to say the least. While a media feeding frenzy (a term popularized in the 1988 campaign) always creates an unseemly air of hysteria, Biden deserved the scrutiny he received. Quitting the race was the right thing to do. Twenty-one years on, how much should Biden""s past behavior matter? In and of itself, the plagiarism episode shouldn""t automatically disqualify Biden from regaining favor and credibility, especially if in the intervening two decades he""s not done more of the same, as seems to be the case. But no one has looked into it. The press should give his record since 1988 a thorough vetting. It""s worth knowing whether the odds-on favorite to be our next vice president has truly reformed himself of behavior that can often be the mark of a deeply troubled soul. *** Note: In an article about plagiarism, crediting sources seems especially wise. I relied on three books about the 1988 campaign: Jack Germond and Jules Witcover""s Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars?: The Trivial Pursuit of the Presidency 1988; Sidney Blumenthal""s Pledging Allegiance: The Last Campaign of the Cold War; and Peter Goldman and Tom Mathews"" The Quest for the Presidency 1988, along with articles from the New York Times and Washington Post."
slate|"Friday is the 100th day of Joe Biden""s term. Traditionally, this period of a presidency involves media discussion of honeymoons, mandates, and ambitious agendas, but also of burgeoning scandals that threaten to stall the new administration""s momentum. Biden, however, has kept his scandal quotient near zero by refusing to address topics besides his popular COVID and economic relief initiatives. While some real screw-ups have taken place, they have been outnumbered by faux controversies hyped ineffectively by Republicans desperate to get traction against a president who appeals to many Americans because they don""t need to pay attention to what he""s doing on a day-to-day basis. We""ve ranked them all here, in order, from most to least legitimately suggestive of presidential dishonesty and/or incompetence. And yes, the hamburger thing is last. • The refugee cap. On April 16, the administration announced that it would not be raising the historically low annual cap on refugee admissions imposed by Donald Trump, despite Biden having promised to do so many times during the 2020 campaign. This was a moral and political error whose egregiousness was made clear immediately when it was criticized openly by basically every other elected Democrat, including centrist-minded senior figures like Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin. Biden seems to have reasoned that raising Trump""s xenophobic refugee limit would draw attention to the administratively unrelated blame he is taking for an increase in undocumented Mexico–U.S. border crossings that began in 2020—blame that, however dubious, is understood by poll watchers as something that might weaken his standing with some swing voters. But everyone in the party except Biden seemed to believe that breaking a campaign promise in order to endorse an intentionally immigrant-hostile Trump policy was both bad governance and bad politics, and, after a few hours, the administration reversed its reversal. • Hunter Biden""s trash gun. In March, Politico reported on a 2018 incident in which a gun belonging to Biden""s son Hunter was briefly lost in the trash outside a Delaware grocery store after Hallie Biden—Hunter""s sister-in-law, the widow of his late brother Beau—took the gun away from Hunter and tried to dispose of it there. (It was eventually found by a man collecting recyclables.) Anonymous sources told the publication that, while the gun was still missing, Secret Service agents tried to take possession of gun-store paperwork that documented Hunter""s original purchase of the weapon. (The gothic slapstick of it all was undermined by the news that, according to a police report, Hunter believes Hallie confiscated the gun out of fear that he might harm himself.) Despite involving a facially credible allegation of an abuse of power—the idea is that the Secret Service might have tried to take the paperwork to prevent Hunter from being linked back to the then-missing gun if it ended up being used in a crime—this story hasn""t developed any further, perhaps because Republicans spent so much time crying wolf about Hunter Biden stories before and during the 2020 campaign. Congressional members of the GOP are, nonetheless, trying to keep it in the news. • Neera Tanden""s mean tweets. Yes, we""re on the third one of these and already using the phrase ""mean tweets""—it""s been a wild three months! But it does in fact qualify as a scandal, or at least a misstep, by historical standards, that would-be Office of Management and Budget director Neera Tanden""s nomination was pulled because some Senate Republicans were upset that she had previously used Twitter to describe them with such vicious, graphic insults as ""the worst"" and ""Voldemort."" • T.J. Ducklo. This one is not funny even in a Veep kind of way, but ranks below Tanden because of how minor a figure was involved, namely T.J. Ducklo, a deputy press secretary who resigned after Vanity Fair reported that he""d threatened to ""destroy"" a Politico reporter who was working on a story he didn""t like; Ducklo also told the reporter that he believed she was jealous of him for some reason involving a different man not being interested in having sex with her (the reporter). Very convoluted, but unquestionably inappropriate for the workplace! He is gone now. • Andrew Cuomo""s handling of nursing homes. It""s been established that Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo suppressed unflattering data that revealed the extent to which COVID-19 spread through his state""s nursing homes in the spring of 2020. This isn""t funny either; it also doesn""t have anything to do with Biden""s administration despite the best efforts of right-wing media outlets to suggest a connection. • Major Biden. One of Joe Biden""s rescue dogs keeps biting people at the White House, getting sent out for training, returning to the White House, and getting sent out for more training after biting more people. Now Jill Biden says they""re also gonna get a cat! No! Don""t do it, Dr. Jill Biden! • Disrespecting the Space Force. In early February, two Republican congressmen made outraged statements accusing White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki of being too glib in answering a question about the Trump-founded ""Space Force"" military branch during a briefing. Her attitude, the GOP members said, evinced a troubling indifference to the upper-atmospheric threat presented by China, a warning that proved all too prescient this week, when D.C. was destroyed by Chinese UFO lasers. • Canceling Dr. Seuss. In early March, Biden issued a proclamation about Read Across America Day that broke from precedent by not specifically mentioning Dr. Seuss. This coincided with the decision by Dr. Seuss Enterprises to stop publishing six Seuss books, none of which were among his best-known, because they contain anachronistic, racist imagery. In the right wing""s telling, this became an attempt by Biden, and social-justice Democrats generally, to erase Dr. Seuss from history, to which some conservatives responded by making a show of ordering Seuss books, which, in addition to proving tangibly that Dr. Seuss"" work is still widely available, means many of them now own work that celebrates anti-materialist communitarianism, environmentalism, and the rewards of trying foreign food. • Indoctrinating border children with Kamala Harris"" book. On April 24, the New York Post ran a cover story which reported that a 2019 children""s book published under Vice President Kamala Harris"" name was being included in ""welcome kits"" for unaccompanied immigrant minors at a shelter in Southern California. The entire basis for this claim was a photo of one of the books at the shelter, and it turns out it was a single copy that had been donated to a book and toy drive. Pretty bad job there, New York Post! • If ground beef is outlawed, only outlaws will grind beef. Biden""s climate-related proposals are not going to require rationing red meat to the point that Americans can only eat one hamburger a month, as Fox News claimed while intentionally mangling an academic study that had already been intentionally mangled by the Daily Mail. In fact, they don""t mention red meat at all. This story, you might say, was just red meat for the easily angered right-wing base. Ha ha ha. Hahahahaha. How will the next 100 days ever top that? What a pickle! Get it? Like on a—OK."
slate|"You can add another item to the list of scandals in President Joe Biden""s first 100 days in office. And it came right in the nick of time. On Thursday, Biden was walking to Marine One alongside his wife, Jill Biden, when he suddenly bent down, picked a dandelion from the grass and presented it to the first lady before they boarded the helicopter. Pretty much everyone quickly recognized it for the sweet moment that it was, and many were quick to point to the contrast with Biden""s predecessor, who rarely had any public moments of affection with his wife while in office. Reuters, for example, wrote in a tweet that the move showed how Biden was ""ever the romantic."" Not everyone was happy with the dandelion-giver though. Newsmax host Grant Stinchfield had a mini freak out about it on air while the chyron made it clear what he thought about the whole thing: ""Biden bizarrely gives Jill a dandelion."" As Stinchfield starts talking about it, he sets the scene as if he""s about to present something profoundly weird. ""All right folks, take a look at this,"" he said. He then starts recounting the scene. ""And he stops and picks up—I think it""s a dandelion? But it""s a dandelion that hasn""t even blossomed into a flower yet,"" Stinchfied complains, ""like it gives everybody asthma."" Leave aside for a moment that the dandelion had, in fact, already passed its flowering stage, it seems Stinchfield has some past trauma with dandelions. As far as Stinchield is concerned, dandelions are chaotic and a force for evil. ""You blow it, it goes everywhere, and then everybody starts sneezing,"" he said. Little wonder then that he doesn""t think it was a romantic move and even (jokingly one would hope) raises the possibility it was all a set-up. ""He picks up the weed and gives it to Jill in what I guess is supposed to be some kind of a sweet gesture,"" he scoffed. ""I say it was a planted dandelion there. Who knows?"" Many quickly started to post about #DandelionGate on social media. Stinchfield brushed off critics on Twitter: ""I think I""m pretty damn funny!"" Newsmax wasn""t alone in mocking Biden for the moment. Laura Ingraham and Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo discussed the moment for several minutes on Friday night. Arroyo mocked Biden for handing his wife ""a weed"" and essentially for trying too hard. ""When you have to work that hard after many years of marriage … something""s wrong,"" he added."
slate|"Democrats being Democrats, it""s no surprise that some are skittish about Hillary Clinton""s campaign, which has been hit with scandals and weak numbers in key swing states. To these Democrats, Clinton isn""t a strong bet, and worse, there isn""t a strong alternative. Bernie Sanders? Popular, but too far to the left to unify a broad and diverse national party. Martin O""Malley? Not exciting. Enter Joe Biden. The sitting vice president is the third-most visible Democratic politician behind President Barack Obama and Clinton. The Wall Street Journal reports he""s moving closer to a run: He has sat with political allies, talked with family, and even met with influential Democrats like Elizabeth Warren. Yes, if he ran he""d start from behind, but he""s popular and could build a formidable primary campaign with the right backing and staff. There""s also something to the idea of a Biden run. Even as the favorite, Clinton needs an effective sparing partner on the trail. A Biden run might be good for her skills as a candidate—a point I""ve argued before. But it""s worth stepping from the horserace to ask a different kind of question: Would a run be good for Biden? Large parts of the Democratic Party—including a confrontational activist movement—are committed to de-escalating the war on drugs and moving crime policy away from the approach of the 1980s and 1990s, an approach that Biden pioneered. This is more than trouble for his still-hypothetical campaign; it""s trouble for his legacy. A large part of running for president is intense scrutiny on personal history and political records. But once you""re in office, that scrutiny subsides. Once you""ve left, it almost disappears. Right now, Biden is beloved, an avuncular and light-hearted figure who contrasts the president""s stoic cool and adds a touch of heart to the seemingly mechanistic Obama White House. Forgotten (at least, outside academia and a few corners of political media) is Biden""s earlier persona: a leader in America""s drug war. For a generation, Biden was at the front of a national push for tough drug laws and police militarization. If you consider her time in Bill Clinton""s White House, that""s true for Hillary, too. The difference is that she was first lady—an advocate for her husband""s policies, but not a lawmaker. That""s why she""s able to meet face to face with members of the Black Lives Matter movement and not look disingenuous when she says she has changed her mind on the subject. Biden""s Senate career, by contrast, was defined by his aggressive and vocal support for the drug war. Here are the highlights of that history: In 1984, he worked with Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond and the Reagan administration to craft and pass the Comprehensive Control Act, which enhanced and expanded civil asset forfeiture, and entitled local police departments to a share of captured assets. Critics say this incentivizes abuse, citing countless cases of unfair and unaccountable seizures. In one case last February, Drug Enforcement Administration officers seized $11,000 in cash from a 24-year-old college student. They didn""t find guns or drugs, but they kept the money anyway. In 1986, Biden co-sponsored the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which created new mandatory minimum sentences for drugs, including the infamous crack-versus-cocaine sentencing disparity. A crack cocaine user with only five grams would receive five years without parole, while a powder cocaine user had to possess 500 grams before seeing the same punishment. The predictable consequence was a federal drug regime that put its toughest penalties on low-level drug sellers and the most impoverished drug users. Biden would also play an important role in crafting the 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which strengthened mandatory minimums for drug possession, enhanced penalties for people who transport drugs, and established the Office of National Drug Control Policy, whose director was christened ""drug czar"" by Biden. His broadest contribution to crime policy was the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, commonly called the 1994 Crime Bill. Written by Biden and signed by President Clinton, it increased funds for police and prisons, fueling a huge expansion of the federal prison population. As journalist Radley Balko details in The Rise of The Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America""s Police Forces, it also contributed to the rapid growth of militarized police forces that used new federal funds to purchase hundreds of thousands of pieces of military equipment, from flak jackets and automatic rifles to armored vehicles and grenade launchers. The ""crime bill"" also brought a host of new federal death penalty crimes, which Biden celebrated in his defense of the bill. ""Let me define the liberal wing of the Democratic Party,"" he said to Sen. Orrin Hatch, ""The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is now for 60 new death penalties … the liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 100,000 cops. The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 125,000 new state prison cells."" It""s true that much of this—especially the most egregious and ill-conceived measures—was a response to extraordinarily high crime rates that devastated urban communities. Many of Biden""s allies, in fact, were black Democrats from communities where violence was common and pervasive. But Biden would keep this approach, even as violent crime declined through the 1990s and into the 2000s. He would continue to vote for strong anti-drug efforts, going as far as to push for a federal crackdown on raves, citing ecstasy distribution. While Biden has shifted on some drug issues, he remains a staunch defender of his record on crime, even as Bill and Hillary Clinton have expressed their regret for the consequences of the 1994 crime bill and other anti-drug policies. Joe Biden, in other words, is the Democratic face of the drug war. ""There""s a tendency now to talk about Joe Biden as the sort of affable if inappropriate uncle, as loudmouth and silly,"" says sociologist Naomi Murakawa in an interview with the Marshall Project to discuss her book The First Civil Right: How Liberals Built Prison America. ""But he""s actually done really deeply disturbing, dangerous reforms that have made the criminal justice system more lethal and just bigger."" In a Democratic primary that increasingly turns on these issues, having to defend or walk back those positions is a bad place to occupy. His opponents—whether Clinton or Bernie Sanders or Martin O""Malley—will use his record against him, and millions of Democrats will begin to see him like Murakawa does: as someone who widened the path to prison for countless young men of color. The end result for Biden would be a newly tarnished reputation and—in all likelihood—another failed presidential campaign. Which is to say that, if Biden thinks Hillary needs an opponent of her stature, he""s probably right. But before he makes the jump, he should ask himself: Is a campaign worth the damage it will do to him personally? After years in public life, is this how he wants to end his career? Read more of Slate""s coverage of the 2016 campaign."
slate|"For the vast majority of his career, Joe Biden was a proud deficit hawk—a man who fretted for decades about federal spending and, on occasion, bragged about his own personal attempts in the 1980s ""to freeze all government spending, including Social Security,"" in the name of fiscal prudence. Now, in the midst of a Democratic primary that has seen the party move left on nearly every major policy issue, Biden""s rivals are attacking him for that record, and rightly so: Biden""s past willingness to put popular entitlements on the table could be a serious political liability in a race against Donald Trump, who has repeatedly promised not to cut Social Security benefits for the elderly. Just as importantly, the former vice president""s history on the budget raises serious questions about whether he would cave to sudden demands for austerity if he were ever confronted by a Republican Congress, much as he was seemingly ready to do during the Obama administration. So far, the criticisms about Biden""s record on federal spending and Social Security have primarily come from Bernie Sanders and his supporters. Unfortunately, not all of their accusations have been fair. On January 7, for instance, the Vermont senator sent out a newsletter that claimed Biden had ""lauded Paul Ryan for proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare"" during a 2018 speech at the Brookings Institution. As Politifact reported, this was untrue; in his own slightly muddled way, Biden appeared to be sarcastically mocking Ryan for proposing tax cuts so sweeping that they could only be paid for with large entitlement cuts. At the New York Times, Paul Krugman seized on the distortion to accuse Sanders of ""smearing"" Biden and adopting ""Trumpian"" tactics. And yet, as Krugman admits, there""s no getting around the fact that Biden spent the vast majority of his time in Washington beating the drum for budget cuts. Was he just a product of his times? Sort of. Biden joined the Senate at a moment when New Deal liberalism was giving way to fiscal conservatism and skepticism about big government. After Ronald Reagan""s victory, plenty of Democrats tacked to the center on issues such as crime and spending, and over the coming decades, debt-panic and a grave willingness to ""tackle entitlements"" slowly became the mark of supposedly serious Washington politicians. But Biden was especially energetic about it all. He began sponsoring bills designed to curb the budget in the late 1970s. In 1984, as deficits mounted thanks to Reagan""s tax cuts, Biden warned of looming economic catastrophe and co-sponsored legislation that would freeze all federal spending for a year, including Social Security. The idea flopped, but Biden still pushed similar spending pauses throughout the decade. He also backed a line-item veto, another favored fad among deficit hawks. In 1995, he chose to side with the new Republican majority in Congress and backed a balanced budget amendment to the constitution, warning that the national debt was threatening to consume the rest of the federal budget. ""Unless this thing gets focused,"" he told the New York Times, ""by the time we face the music, everything I care about is going to be gone."" The amendment ultimately lost by a single vote in the Senate, because Democrats said that they were worried it would lead Congress to raid the Social Security Trust Fund in order to limit the deficit. Biden, along with other members of his party, had fought to tweak the amendment so that it would exclude the retirement program. But after that effort failed, he put his concerns aside and voted yay with the GOP anyway. When Republicans took a second doomed shot at the balanced budget amendment in 1997, he supported it again. Biden was not always on the side of the deficit slashers and debt alarmists. He helped kill a balanced budget amendment in 1986, for instance, telling reporters that Congress had just passed a major piece of legislation meant to limit the deficit, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, and that lawmakers should wait to see how it worked (he also co-sponsored legislation to protect Social Security from the effect of that law). In 1995, the same year he got on board with the GOP""s constitutional amendment, he actually voted against a bill that would have balanced the budget within seven years, which President Bill Clinton later vetoed on the grounds that it was too draconian. Around that time, Biden gave a typically florid speech in which he insisted that he was as worried about the deficit as anybody, but suggested that the GOP needed to compromise on its time frame: In a lot of ways, Biden""s remarks here perfectly symbolize the politics of that era, during which the word ""liberal"" was treated as a dirty word and lots of Democrats adopted center-right politics on issues like crime, welfare-reform, and the deficit in order to hold moderate voters and fend off the GOP""s worst plans. There were also good reasons for Biden to vote as a centrist; we think of Delaware as a solidly blue state today, but until 2001, the state""s other senator was a Republican. At the same time, there""s little evidence to suggest that Biden was anything but sincere in his positions. One notable thing about Biden""s Senate career is that he showed relatively little interest in economic issues, focusing more on foreign affairs and criminal justice, which fit with his committee assignments. Yes, he was a driving force behind the bankruptcy reform bill that has come to be seen as a sop to credit card companies in his home state of Delaware. But other than that, Biden""s main economic policy cause really seemed to be the debt. Now, decades later, it""s easy to imagine how Biden""s old words and causes could come back to haunt him against Trump. One of the president""s central campaign promises, the thing that made him look like a moderate in the eyes of many voters, was that he would not touch Medicare or Social Security benefits for the elderly (though disability is another story). Cut to a future Trump ad featuring ready-made C-SPAN clips of Biden waving his arms and boasting about trying to freeze the program, as Sanders staffer David Sirota was happy to highlight on Twitter a few weeks ago. It doesn""t help that Biden continued to talk about cuts to entitlements deep into his Senate career. Intercept reporter Ryan Grim has noted that when Biden campaigned for president in 2007, he told Meet the Press host Tim Russert that he would consider benefit and eligibility changes to Social Security and Medicare to deal with the deficit, and boasted about helping to negotiate the deal that raised the retirement age to 67. His current campaign platform actually calls for slightly expanding Social Security benefits for seniors. And yet, during that recent Brookings speech, he still somehow managed to suggest—albeit in an aside—that both Social Security and Medicare would need ""adjustments"" to stay around, which most pundits on the left have interpreted as a euphemism for ""cuts."" (This isn""t the first time Biden""s comments on the stump have clashed with his official platform; he""s talked about bringing back Obamacare""s individual mandate, even though his health care plan says nothing about doing so.) It""s exceedingly unlikely that a Democratic Congress would ever try to slash Social Security or Medicare. One important question, however, is what will happen if President Biden comes face-to-face with a Republican Congress—or even just a GOP-held House or Senate—that tries to force his hand on spending cuts. (Mitch McConnell has essentially said he will wait until a Democrat is in office to try to slash entitlements, because it""s too unpopular for the GOP to do on its own.) We know what transpired during the Obama administration: The White House tried to compromise. It agreed that the deficit was a clear and present danger—despite the fact that the economy was still depressed after the recession—and attempted to negotiate a grand bargain of spending cuts and tax increases. Biden himself led discussions with a bipartisan group on behalf of the administration, and appeared ready to give up trillions in budget reductions, though they wouldn""t have targeted the major entitlements. As late as 2014, Obama caved to Republican requests and included a proposal to slow down the growth of Social Security benefits in his annual budget (he later dropped the idea in the face of liberal pushback). Would a Biden administration travel down the same road, and try to compromise? Compromise, after all, is what Biden is running on. Ideally, a Democratic president in 2021 would not only oppose budget cuts today, but would jettison most of Washington""s obsession with so-called fiscal discipline. The national debt is, truly, among the least of our problems right now. We may need to fully pay for ongoing expenses like a healthcare expansion. But there are plenty of urgent priorities with big, one-time price tags—infrastructure, a transition to green energy—that could be deficit financed without causing any significant economic issues. Certainly, the rock bottom interest rates on U.S. treasury debt suggest we have plenty of room to borrow. It unfortunately might be too much to ask for that kind of leader. But at the very least, the next person in the Oval Office should be able to stand up to the debt scolds on the big issues, like entitlements or austerity. If they can""t, the sick and elderly will suffer, the economy will suffer, and their presidency will suffer. One tragedy of the Obama administration was how, following the failure of the grand bargain, the GOP still steamrolled it into passing major spending cuts that helped turn the economic recovery into a crawl, and may well have contributed to a Trump win in the end. Perhaps Biden learned a lesson from that experience, and would resist repeating it. But our ex-VP has talked extensively about his desire to return to an era of bipartisan cooperation. And whether we""re talking about Social Security or another major program, the budget is one area in which those instincts are truly scary."
slate|"Near the end of Thursday night""s Democratic primary debate, moderator Linsey Davis asked former Vice President Joe Biden a question. Joe Biden then, according to the conventions of debate, was supposed to respond to that question. Here is that question: And here is the leading Democratic presidential candidate""s answer, in full: This has been Joe Biden Answers a Question. Thank you for joining us."
slate|"Joe Biden has embraced the Green New Deal. He might not have uttered those magic words on Tuesday while unveiling his campaign""s new, far-reaching plan to combat climate change and revitalize the U.S. economy, but he didn""t have to. In substance and spirit, the Democratic nominee has signed on to the concept""s most important pieces, while doing away with some of its more controversial, and less essential, trappings. It""s understandable why Biden might avoid the branding. For many moderates and conservatives, including our president, the phrase ""green new deal"" itself has become a shorthand for leftist overreach. In part, that""s because no one group can really claim complete ownership of the idea and some maximalist versions favored by young activists have included things like Medicare for All and a federal jobs guarantee, along with zeroing out carbon emissions, which make their proposals look a bit like democratic-socialist wishlists disguised as plans to stop global warming. When Democrats in Congress actually tried to write up an official Green New Deal framework in 2019, a bizarre, unofficial FAQ circulated by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez""s staff explained that they""d lowered their 10-year emissions goals a bit ""because we aren""t sure that we""ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast."" The result has been a never-ending stream of jokes about banning hamburgers—the kind of crazy that Biden, whose whole candidacy is basically comfort food for America""s moderates, would like to avoid. But when it comes to actual climate policy, the Green New Deal has always represented a very specific and serious philosophical shift. In the past, Democrats have wanted to reduce emissions through market-oriented mechanisms like a carbon tax or cap and trade. You still see prominent strains of that thinking today, such as when a bipartisan group of 45 renowned economists, including former Federal Reserve Chairs and nobel laureates, signed an open letter in the Wall Street Journal calling for a carbon-tax-and-dividend scheme. Green New Dealers have taken a different, less market-focused approach, combining clean power mandates that would force a shift away from carbon, massive government spending and industrial policy designed to create jobs, and a strong emphasis on environmental justice for communities hardest hit by pollution. Instead of putting a price on CO2 and letting capitalism do its magic, the new generation of climate hawks want to force power companies and other emitters to abandon fossil fuels while using the federal purse to put people to work and reinvent the American economy. Biden""s primary season climate plan included some of those pillars, and even referred to the Green New Deal as a ""crucial framework,"" but the new version adopts it much more fully. The candidate""s original platform called for $1.7 trillion in spending over 10 years, and set a goal of zero net emissions by 2050. The new edition ups the price tag to $2 trillion over four years (there""s your massive spending), and aims to scrub carbon from the electricity sector by 2035 using a clean energy standard for utilities (there""s your mandate). Biden has also rolled out a ""made-in-America"" economic plan that would use gobs of government procurement and R&D funding to build up domestic sectors like renewable batteries and electric vehicles (there""s your industrial policy). And the campaign has outlined an extensive proposal to ""secure environmental justice"" by directing 40 percent of its climate spending to disadvantaged communities. Biden is borrowing some of his new ideas directly from Washington Governor Jay Inslee, whose short presidential run made him a folk hero to climate hawks. The proposal to achieve clean electricity by 2035 comes from Inslee. So does Biden""s call for to create a Civilian Climate Corps that would work on restoration and resilience projects, a direct nod to Franklin Roosevelt""s original New Deal-era Civilian Conservation Corps. As writers like Vox""s Dave Roberts have noted, Inslee""s campaign essentially wrote a a nuts-and-bolts ""instruction manual"" for achieving the Green New Deal""s climate goals, even if he didn""t quite use the name. Now, the former veep appears to be reading from it. ""Basically, Joe Biden endorsed a Green New Deal in our view, substantively,"" Julian Brave NoiseCat, the vice president of strategy and policy at the progressive polling and policy shop Data for Progress, told me. (His outfit was among the first to outline what a Green New Deal might actually look like, releasing a plan in September 2018.) Other left-wing groups haven""t gone quite that far, in part because Biden""s plan doesn""t adopt some of their more absolutist stances on energy. Unlike his former opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, for instance, Biden wouldn""t ban natural gas and oil fracking or phase out nuclear power, and he leaves the door open to carbon capture technology, which some environmentalists see as distracting techno-optimism, and a lot of others think will be absolutely essential if we want to keep the planet from frying . Also, on the list of differences: AOC and Sen. Ed Markey wanted to move the country to clean energy in 10 years, whereas Biden""s timeline is longer and more realistic. And, of course, he isn""t signing on to Medicare for All. But activists are still clearly happy with Biden""s leftward shift. The Sunrise Movement, the youth activist organization closely associated with the Green New Deal, issued an approving statement that took credit for teaching Joe Bide to ""talk the talk"" on climate, and promised to make him ""walk the walk."" The group had previously given Biden""s climate plan an ""F"" grade during the Democratic primary. What""s important about all of this, in the end, is that the activist wing of the Democratic party and its temperamentally moderate presidential nominee now appear to be closely aligned when it comes to their core approach to economic and climate policy. While Biden was getting ready to give his climate speech Tuesday, I happened to be talking with one of his longtime economic advisers, Jared Bernstein. I asked what part of his agenda Biden was most excited about. ""I think what gets him particularly excited is doing something in the clean energy space that also helps domestic manufacturers, so that you""re doing well by doing good,"" Bernstein told me. What""s more, talking the talk comes extremely naturally to Biden. The Green New Deal, in the end, is meant to connect job creation and climate policy in the minds of voters. Adopting it as a keystone of his campaign gives Biden an excuse rhapsodize about bringing back well-paying blue collar jobs. ""Look, these aren""t pie in the sky dreams,"" he said in his speech Tuesday. ""These are actionable policies that we can get to work on right away."" ""When Donald Trump thinks about renewable energy, he sees windmills somehow causing cancer,"" Biden told the crowd. ""When I think about these windmills, I see American manufacturing, American workers rising to dominate the global markets. I see steel that will be needed for those windmill platforms, towers and ladders which could be made in small manufacturers. I see the union-certified men and women who will manufacture and install it all. I see the ports that will come back to life—the longshoremen and the shipbuilders and the communities they support."" That""s the Green New Deal, minus a bit of crazy."
slate|"Seven women have now accused Joe Biden of touching them in an overly familiar way that made them feel uncomfortable or embarrassed. Biden released a video on Wednesday saying that he hugged people or grabbed their shoulders because of a desire to ""make a human connection"" and comfort people in times of stress or hardship. He said he would try to be more ""mindful and respectful of people""s personal space"" because ""social norms are changing."" Even though it appears his defense will appease his base—and several women who experienced such intimate physical contact from Biden have come forward to defend his ""affectionate"" style of engaging with acquaintances and strangers—three more women have come forward since the video to accuse him of touching them in a way that left them feeling uncomfortable. Here is the complete list of the accusations against Biden. Lucy Flores
In an essay for the Cut, Flores wrote that when she was running as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor of Nevada, Biden came up to her and placed his hands on her shoulders just before she went onstage to talk at a campaign event. ""I felt him get closer to me from behind,"" she wrote. ""He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified. … He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn""t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused."" The encounter left her feeling ashamed, confused, and demeaned at what was meant to be an important career moment for her, she wrote. Amy Lappos
In an interview with the Hartford Courant on Monday, a former congressional aide to Rep. Jim Himes said she had been a volunteer at a 2009 fundraiser when Biden approached her. ""It wasn""t sexual, but he did grab me by the head,"" Lappos said. ""He put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me. When he was pulling me in, I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth."" Lappos told the Courant she felt Biden had crossed ""a line of respect"" in a sexist way. She told the New York Times she spoke out because she was disappointed in the public reaction to Flores"" allegations. ""Uninvited affection is not okay,"" she said. ""Objectifying women is not okay."" Caitlyn Caruso
The next day, Caruso, a sexual assault survivor who met Biden three years ago when she was a 19-year-old college student at an event related to sexual assault at the University of Nevada–Las Vegas, told the New York Times about her experience with Biden. She said Biden ""rested his hand on her thigh—even as she squirmed in her seat to show her discomfort—and hugged her ""just a little bit too long,"" "" according to the Times. She told the Times that she did not say anything publicly because she just thought it was ""how men act."" But she had just shared her story of sexual assault and felt Biden had failed to understand her need for boundaries, she said. D.J. Hill
In the same article, the Times interviewed a writer who met Biden at a 2012 fundraising event in Minneapolis. She told the Times that Biden had placed his hand on her shoulder before dropping it down to her back, making her ""very uncomfortable."" Speaking on Fox News on Wednesday, she called for a zero tolerance policy on invading personal space and said she had come forward because she wanted to see a ""cultural change."" Vail Kohnert-Yount
In 2013, she was a White House intern, standing aside at the exit of the West Wing""s basement to allow the vice president to move through, when she met Biden. According to Kohnert-Yount, Biden introduced himself and shook her hand. ""He then put his hand on the back of my head and pressed his forehead to my forehead while he talked to me,"" she told the Washington Post in an article published early Thursday. ""I was so shocked that it was hard to focus on what he was saying. I remember he told me I was a ""pretty girl."" "" She told the Post that even though she did not consider the interaction sexual harassment, she had felt embarrassed that Biden had commented on her appearance. She said she thought Biden""s intentions were good but that it amounted to ""the kind of inappropriate behavior that makes many women feel uncomfortable and unequal in the workplace."" Sofie Karasek
In the same article, Karasek, one of 51 sexual assault victims who appeared with Lady Gaga onstage at the Oscars, said that she met Biden after the ceremony and told him the story of a college student who died by suicide after being sexually assaulted. Biden, in response, held her hands and placed his forehead against hers in a gesture others told the Post was a common one for the former vice president. Karasek told the Post that she appreciated that Biden was making a gesture of support but felt that he had inappropriately invaded her personal space at an emotionally charged moment. ""He emphasized that he wants to connect with people and, of course, that""s important,"" she said. ""But too often it doesn""t matter how the woman feels about it, or they just assume that they""re fine with it."" Ally Coll
Coll said she had been a Democratic staffer in 2008 when she was introduced to Biden at a reception. She told the Post that Biden complimented her smile and held her shoulders ""for a beat too long."" She said she felt uncomfortable at the time but ignored it because of her excitement over meeting him. She told the Post she now thinks his behavior was inappropriate in a professional setting: ""There""s been a lack of understanding about the way that power can turn something that might seem innocuous into something that can make somebody feel uncomfortable."""

slate|"Joe Biden has been keeping a low profile since his decisive victories in the Illinois and Florida primaries made him the presumptive Democratic nominee for the presidency. He has given no public addresses since his victory speech on Tuesday, even as the president flails and the economy collapses. On Friday, Biden spoke to reporters from his home in Delaware, explaining that he""d been keeping radio silence while his staff tackled the challenging technical problem of setting up higher-quality cameras and video conferencing equipment. ""We""ve hired a professional team to do that now,"" Biden told reporters. ""And excuse the expression: That""s a little above my pay grade.""

bipartisan_report|"A new Hill/ HarrisX survey reveals support for President Joe Biden""s overall job performance from a full 61 percent of respondents, which is dramatically higher than the average levels of support that Donald Trump got while in office. Trump left office with overall approval from an average of under 40 percent of Americans, and according to FiveThirtyEight""s weighted average of poll results from across his term, Trump never even hit an average of 50 percent overall approval at any point of his presidency. Out of seven individual policy areas that the Hill/ HarrisX survey asked respondents about, Biden got support from a majority of respondents on all but one: immigration. Even on that issue, he was close, with 49 percent of overall respondents expressing approval for his handling of the topic and 51 percent expressing disapproval. Recently, Republican leaders have run with increasing levels of migration at the southern border and tried to use the situation to depict Biden""s administration as fundamentally threatening the country. As for other issues, Biden got the support of 60 percent of respondents for his handling of the economy, 58 percent on stimulating job growth, 58 percent on combating terrorism, 57 percent on handling foreign affairs, 60 percent on dealing with governmental administration, and 67 percent on tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. On a note similar to that last number, Biden""s COVID-19 economic relief package has repeatedly garnered high levels of support in polling. In a Gallup survey from last month, the package got the support of 63 percent of respondents, and on other occasions, overall support has hit 70 percent. These high levels of support for Biden and his agenda suggest that Democrats could fare well in the upcoming midterm elections, when control of both houses of Congress will be at stake, although there""s still considerable time to go until the elections unfold. Ahead of the midterms, Republican state legislators in states like Georgia and Iowa have rolled out — and enacted — tough new election restrictions. In Iowa, authorities even slashed an hour from the time that polling places will be open on Election Day, which seems unmistakably punitive. Republicans have moved forward with these restrictions despite the fact that no systematic security issues were discovered during the 2020 cycle."
bipartisan_report|"According to a new report from POLITICO, President Joe Biden ""is expected to unveil a long-awaited package of executive actions to curb gun violence"" on Thursday at the White House. According to sources for the publication, Biden plans to ""direct the administration to begin the process of requiring buyers of so-called ghost guns — homemade or makeshift firearms that lack serial numbers — to undergo background checks,"" while other specific steps were ""unclear"" at the time of publication. Mass shootings have recently unfolded in California, Colorado, and Georgia, underscoring the urgency of action. According to POLITICO, ""stakeholders have speculated that the president could announce regulations on concealed assault-style firearms; prohibitions on firearm purchases for those convicted of domestic violence against their partners; and federal guidance on home storage safety measures."" Meanwhile, another potentially impending announcement is the presentation of Biden""s pick to serve as director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a position that requires Senate confirmation. Broadly, the Biden team has also reiterated the president""s support for legislative moves like broad expansions of background checks for gun purchases. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) recently pledged that he would ""bring universal background checks legislation to the Senate floor,"" although the Senate""s filibuster rule means that advocates would need the agreement of 60 Senators in the 100-member chamber before moving to a final vote on most legislation. Some have called for reforming the filibuster rule, but no reforms have newly been accomplished. Following recent mass shootings, Republicans have predictably already begun complaining about pleas for gun safety measures. My heart goes out to the people of Boulder and the families of those who lost their lives. On Fox, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) recently proclaimed that he owns an AR-15 rifle and would be willing to use it to defend himself if trapped at his home in South Carolina after a natural disaster and facing gang violence. Graham failed to explain how such a situation could even unfold in the first place.

bipartisan_report|"In a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, a full 62 percent of overall respondents said that they approve of the job that President Joe Biden is doing regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and that number includes a full 30 percent of Republicans overall and 22 percent of Trump supporters in particular. At present, the Biden administration""s pandemic response efforts include economic relief and nationwide vaccine distribution. This week, Biden signed a $1.9 trillion relief package into law, and this week, Biden also announced that he was directing all states to make all adults eligible for vaccinations by May 1. Issues remain, of course — some relief, like the expanded child tax credit, could take comparatively longer to implement, and even after having enough vaccines on hand to cover all adults in the country, there""s still the issue of actually getting those doses administered. In the meantime, Americans seem clearly hopeful about the direction of the pandemic response under the direction of the Biden administration. Trump""s pandemic response reached such pathetic lows that, most of the time, he wouldn""t even promote mask-wearing, and when he got vaccinated earlier this year, he did not reveal that he""d taken the step. Notably, in the new polling, only 28 percent of overall respondents said that they approve of Congressional Republicans"" job performance. As summarized by NPR regarding the relief legislation, ""Biden is set to promote the passing of the legislation in a way that former President Barack Obama never did with the 2009 Recovery Act,"" according to the White House. The legislation has widespread support among Americans — in a recent Morning Consult survey, 75 percent of overall respondents (including plenty of Republicans) said that they supported the relief package — but not a single Republican in Congress voted in favor of the legislation — although that didn""t stop one Republican from glibly touting a key provision of the law anyway! On Twitter, Sen.

Wicker retweeted a message from the Independent Restaurant Coalition claiming that the Senator""s ""work on the RESTAURANTS Act from the beginning made the relief fund possible,"" but again, the fact remains: Wicker voted against the relief that he""s glibly touting.

Despite the fact that they had no comprehensive replacement ready to go, the Trump administration backed a lawsuit seeking the invalidation of the entire health care law on the grounds of an allegation that the individual mandate no longer had appropriate legal standing because of the decrease of the penalty for failing to obtain health insurance down to zero dollars. The effective elimination of this penalty eliminated any tax-based authority for the law, certain Republicans claimed. The great legal untangling continues: DOJ officially changes positions in the SCOTUS Obamacare fight, saying (unsurprisingly) that the Biden admin's position is the law is constitutional, and if the court disagrees, the section at issue can be severed https://t.co/ZrWqozupm2 pic.twitter.com/CHv6Binpxk — Zoe Tillman (@ZoeTillman) February 10, 2021 Now, Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler — whose job responsibilities include relaying the federal government""s position to the U.S. Supreme Court — told the nation""s highest court that after ""the change in Administration, the Department of Justice has reconsidered the government""s position in these cases,"" adding that the government ""no longer adheres to the conclusions in the previously filed brief of the federal respondents."" In other words, the federal government officially no longer supports the judicial invalidation of the Affordable Care Act. If the Supreme Court were to decide that the individual mandate is unconstitutional under present circumstances, then ""it can be easily separated from the rest of the law,"" as POLITICO summarized Kneedler""s stance. The court already heard oral arguments in the case, and a decision could come soon. When the court heard these arguments on November 10, a ""majority"" of the justices ""seemed inclined to preserve much of the law,"" POLITICO reports, and at the time of arguments, Trump""s third nominee for the court, Amy Coney Barrett, was already in place. Although the court currently has a conservative majority, it""s already repeatedly rebuffed right-wing efforts to use this majority to their political advantage. After the 2020 presidential election, the court — where three of Trump""s own nominees currently sit — repeatedly refused to advance challenges to the election outcome. In a case in which a coalition of Republican state Attorney Generals and the Trump campaign itself sought the invalidation of Biden""s win in certain states, not a single justice indicated that they were interested in granting the demand. Meanwhile, on a similar note, Biden also formally reversed the Trump era national emergency declaration over the southern border situation on Thursday. The Trump administration used this declaration as an excuse to divert billions of dollars in government funds towards construction of southern border barriers."

tpm|"When Utah lawmakers had the chance to kick the tires on a new privacy program the Census Bureau is planning for the 2020 data, what they found was troubling. A test in February on a version of the program that was run on 2010 census numbers produced a major distortion of what cities and towns in rural Utah look like. The populations in the tiny towns of Tabiona and Alton were shrunk to less than half their actual sizes. Twenty cities overall saw 20 percent or more of their inhabitants wiped away, and the state incurred a net population loss of nearly 15,000. The smallest town in Utah, the former mining town of Scofield, saw its inhabitants double from 24 to 52. The Census Bureau has since made some tweaks to the system that have mitigated some of these sledge-hammer effects. Yet an intense but under the radar debate over the program — known as differential privacy — has continued to roil the larger census community. The chaos that the Trump administration brought to other aspects of the decennial survey has overshadowed the controversy around the Bureau""s decision — led by career experts— to subject the 2020 data to the privacy tool. As the release of the data gets closer, the Bureau""s failure so far to prove that it can be implemented without a severe cost to the data""s accuracy is causing major anxiety across a broad coalition of census data users. The decision to use the tool is not related to President Trump""s hijacking of the survey for political purposes. In fact, it""s been championed internally by the career census expert who was also the Bureau""s most vocal public critic of the Trump administration""s attempt to add a census citizenship question. But the privacy system has come under fire from census data users of varying stripes who say that they fear, in the name of privacy, the tool will distort the data to the point that the numbers will be unusable for myriad purposes. In their worst case scenarios, the populations of small towns will appear much larger or smaller than what they actually are. A native Alaskan village will look like it""s up to 50 percent white, instead of majority indigenous. A local government""s ability to administer a Meals on Wheels program, or keep track of how a disease is spreading through its elderly population, will be made much more difficult by the way that age data is skewed when the privacy system is used. As these fears take hold, skeptics of the program are currently plotting more aggressive pushback. They are making their concerns known to the incoming Joe Biden team, in the hopes that his Commerce Department will intervene in how the bureau has been handling the program""s rollout. There have been discussions about seeking congressional intervention. And they are also floating the possibility of lawsuits if the bureau is unable to fix the issues that they have identified. The critics are keenly aware of the unprecedented difficulties the Census Bureau has faced with the 2020 census, between the Trump administration""s attempts to hijack the survey for partisan ends, to the pandemic, wildfires and other natural disasters that complicated the count itself. But it""s because of the other threats to the census accuracy — and the significant work by stakeholders  to help the Bureau overcome them — that the critics say the risks of differential privacy are just too great to take on right now. ""The fact that we have spent billions of taxpayer dollars to collect good data, taken millions of hours — of community hours, of local government hours, state hours — to come up with a good count, and then the Census Bureau is going to screw it all up? Frankly, that""s just not fair,"" said Colorado""s state demographer Elizabeth Garner. For this story, TPM spoke to more than a dozen experts who rely on the census data, including state demographers, redistricting consultants, voting rights attorneys and private researchers. Some asked to speak anonymously, for fear of jeopardizing their working relationships with the bureau. Almost everyone acknowledged that the bureau was pursuing differential privacy with good intentions — the bureau is under legal obligations to protect the confidentiality of its census respondents — but all agreed that there were serious flaws in how the bureau has tried to implement the program. The Census Bureau did not respond to TPM""s request for comment. ""We don""t know what it is going to screw up, but no one is watching the cooks here,"" one census expert outside the bureau, who asked not to be named, told TPM. ""This is a time bomb waiting to go off."" For decades, the Census Bureau has used different tactics so that identifying information about the individuals who take the survey isn""t inadvertently disclosed with the release of the data. But according to the Bureau, advances in big data technology have required the bureau to go to new lengths for the 2020 census to stay in compliance with its confidentiality obligations. Differential privacy, the approach the Bureau is planning on taking, injects ""noise"" into the data — in effect, making the data less accurate — to make it more difficult for outsiders to match the characteristics the data capture to specific individuals. But how much noise is really necessary is a touchy topic, and the outside community of census data users say their perspectives have not been represented among those the Bureau tasked with spearheading differential privacy""s implementation. ""The team that""s responsible for implementing differential privacy is really a team of computer scientists, said Ethan Sharygin, the Director of the Population Research Center at Portland State University. ""They don""t have a strong voice on the team to say the results that are produced are usable or not usable."" The critics say the bureau, which only publicly unveiled the work it was doing on differential privacy in 2018, did not give itself enough time to work out the kinks. And the difficulties the bureau continues to face are evident in the demonstrations they have released to preview how the algorithm will work. ""Where we are right now with them should have been two years ago,"" Garner said. If the Bureau cannot get the balance between privacy and accuracy just right, the consequences could be devastating for the larger community of census users. State demographers are fretting about how public policy makers will react when they""re told that projecting life expectancy is not doable using 2020 census data. Civil rights advocates fear that Voting Rights Act enforcement will be hobbled when racial dynamics in communities are made fuzzier. Some experts wonder if the confusion will create a cottage industry of consultants that governments will have to pay to help them clean up the numbers, and others speculate that the shortcomings will fuel arguments for privatizing the census. The smaller the subset of data, the more problematic the distortions are, experts say. ""Half of the school districts are under 10,000 total population, and those are the places that get the most distorted data,"" said Bill O""Hare, a demographer who advises the census advocacy group Count All Kids. As part of analysis of a demonstration product the Census Bureau released in May 2020, he looked at the amount of error that differential privacy injected into the 2010 census count of  0-4 years olds. He found that on average, for schools districts of that size or smaller, those numbers were off by 24 percent. Of particular concern is how characteristics like age, race and ethnicity are skewed. That lack of precision has implications for the effectiveness of public programs: how do governments know how to expend the resources to a community that needs them if they cannot know for sure what the makeup of the community is or where those people are? The effect that differential privacy has on the 2010 census — the demonstrations the Bureau has released allows users to compare the data as released in 2010 to with how it would look with differential privacy —  is also being scrutinized by voting rights attorneys and map drawers to study its effect on Voting Rights Act enforcement. What they have found so far is that the system makes it harder to identify majority-minority districts as they exist on the ground. For African American communities in particular, differential privacy will also make more difficult to suss out the district political preferences those voters have. ""The biggest impacts are likely to come in analyses of racially polarized voters,"" Justin Levitt, an election law professor at Loyola Marymount, told TPM. The Census Bureau is running out of time to overcome these obstacles, and the backlash if the bureau doesn""t will be a mess that the Biden administration will have to clean up. The partisan directives President Trump and his appointees imposed on the census — like the Trump policy to exclude undocumented immigrants from the apportionment count or his order for the collection of citizenship data that states could use to cut non-citizens out of redistricting — will likely be quickly reversed. What Biden can do on differential privacy is a more difficult question. ""You""re at a stage where you""re on the runway and the engines are gearing up and you""re suddenly finding information that tells you: is the engine really good?"" said Kim Brace, a redistricting guru. ""How can you end up raising some of these issues when the plane""s about ready to take off?"" Nevertheless, public lobbying of the Biden transition has been coupled with private outreach to the beachhead team, which includes two well-regarded census experts who are said to be in information-gathering mode. There""s discussions of amping up the pressure on Congress to engage as well. Beyond oversight of the program""s implementation, Congress could also pass tweaks to census privacy laws to clarify that the Bureau need not go so overboard on protecting confidentiality that it sacrifices the data""s usefulness. But there is skepticism that such a legislative fix could be done in time. Without legislation, legal questions about those privacy obligations could quickly come into focus in court instead, if civil rights groups aren""t satisfied with how the Bureau has implemented the program and sue over its use. ""These are legal problems,"" Thomas Saenz, the president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, told TPM. ""Because if you have a clash between Voting Rights Act compliance and what the Census Bureau would describe as compliance with Title 13 and confidentiality provisions, it is that kind of statutory conflict that ends up having to go to court to be resolved."""

tpm|"Tara Reade, a former staffer in Joe Biden""s Senate office who has accused him of sexual assault, on Thursday called for Biden to drop his presidential bid. In an interview with Megyn Kelly, Reade said Biden ""should not be running on character for the President of the United States."" ""You want him to withdraw?"" Kelly asked. ""I wish he would. But he won""t,"" Reade replied. ""But I wish he would. That""s how I feel emotionally.""  In March, during an interview with the progressive journalist Katie Halper, Reade alleged that Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993, penetrating her with his fingers without consent. In an interview on MSNBC""s ""Morning Joe"" earlier this month, Biden ""unequivocally"" denied the allegation. Reade initially told a local California paper last year that Biden ""used to put his hand on my shoulder and run his finger up my neck."" Those initial allegations of harassment did not include the allegation of sexual assault that she later made to Halper. Reade has also alleged that she was pushed out of her job in Biden""s office after filing a complaint about Biden""s behavior, but she has said that the complaint details the allegation of harassment and not the allegation of assault. Reade""s former neighbor, a former colleague, and her brother have said that Reade shared aspects of her allegations with them in the 90s. ""This happened, and I know it did because I remember talking about it,"" Reade""s former neighbor Lynda LaCasse told Business Insider. Separately in the interview with Kelly, Reade said that she would be willing to go under oath and subject herself to cross examination regarding her assault claim.

tpm|"Discredited Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin demanded in a Tuesday affidavit that Kyiv prosecutors open a criminal investigation into Joe Biden. Shokin repeated long-debunked allegations in the declaration, accusing Biden of ""blackmail"" and violating international law in pushing for Shokin to be fired in 2016. The filing marks the latest attempt to have Ukraine open a criminal investigation into a potential opponent of President Trump""s in the 2020 election. It comes as the Senate holds an impeachment trial of President Trump over allegations that he attempted to have Ukraine announce investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 elections. Shokin has popped up throughout the pressure campaign on Ukraine as a source of debunked information for President Trump""s attorney Rudy Giuliani, alleging that Joe Biden fired Shokin to block an investigation he was conducting into a Ukrainian gas firm on whose board Hunter Biden — the Vice President""s son — sat. But the facts tell a different story. Shokin left his post as Ukraine""s top prosecutor amid outcry both within Ukraine and abroad over his lack of progress in investigating corruption cases. One case that Shokin failed to investigate that led to particularly acute criticism — even from the then-U.S. ambassador — was that of Burisma, a gas company whose owner was accused of stealing government funds. The owner fled Ukraine after the country""s 2014 revolution, and Burisma hired a slew of well-connected foreigners to join its board, including former Polish President Aleksandr Kwasniewski and Hunter Biden. Shokin was criticized for not investigating corruption at Burisma and, under pressure from Ukraine""s international backers including Joe Biden, was fired in March 2016. But in the Tuesday affidavit, filed with Ukraine""s State Bureau of Investigations, Shokin describes himself as a ""victim."" He said that he only resigned ""as a result of lengthy pressure on me from U.S. Vice President Joe Biden"" which included ""blackmail through providing financial guarantees"" — a reference to a $1 billion loan guarantee that the U.S. partly conditioned on Ukraine intensifying its anti-corruption efforts, including by firing Shokin. ""As a person who puts the interests of his country above his own, I agreed to step down from the post of general prosecutor of Ukraine,"" Shokin added. Giuliani interviewed Shokin in January 2019, and spoke with the former prosecutor general on camera as part of a One America News TV show which told the story that investigations demanded by Giuliani and Trump aimed to support. Shokin described his own conduct in the declaration as having a ""principled position"" towards bringing the Burisma case to a ""quick and objective"" resolution. Because of that, he claimed, ""Joseph Biden began to have persistent, unpleasant relations towards me,"" resulting in both private and public statements demanding Shokin""s firing ""in exchange for"" a $1 billion loan guarantee. Shokin went on in the declaration to say that ""the illicit influence of Joseph Biden"" was evidence of ""interfering in the activities of a law enforcement officer."" Shokin demanded that Ukrainian prosecutors open a criminal investigation based off of his declaration. A Ukrainian-language version of the filing is available here:"

State Dept. says 80% of world is unsafe. What to know He signed it. So have more than 1 million other people. ""It""s a no-brainer to help the lives of millions of people,"" he said. On the campaign trail, Biden said he supported forgiving $10,000 in student loans for all borrowers, but more recently he has asked his Education secretary to prepare a memo on his legal authority to wipe out as much as $50,000 each for all. That""s after he faced mounting pressure from other Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, from Massachusetts, to go further. Increasingly, borrowers are also among those demanding forgiveness from the president. Erin O""Brien, an associate professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Boston, said the petition is likely to catch eyes in the White House. ""Numbers matter,"" O""Brien said. ""That""s what moves politicians."" Polling shows that two-thirds of Americans support some form of student loan forgiveness. Just 4 in 10, however, believe all the debt should be canceled. Critics of student loan forgiveness argue that it wouldn""t significantly stimulate the economy, since college graduates tend to be higher earners who would likely redirect their monthly payments to savings rather than additional spending. Others say a jubilee would be unfair to those who""ve already paid off their student debt or never took out loans. Those borrowers ""might feel that their frugality was being punished,"" Noah Smith, a columnist for Bloomberg, recently wrote. Advocates say that borrowers were already struggling before the public health crisis — with more than 1 in 4 in delinquency or default — and that after more than a year of record-high unemployment levels, that pain has only worsened. ""Before the Covid-19 public health crisis began, student debt was already a drag on the national economy, weighing heaviest on Black and Latinx communities, as well as women,"" more than 400 organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Psychological Association, wrote in a letter to the White House in April. ""Administrative debt cancellation will deliver real progress on your racial equity, economic recovery, and Covid-19 relief campaign priorities."" Hossfeld and his wife, Hayley, owe around $50,000 in student debt. He graduated from Ohio Dominican University in 2017 with a degree in computer science, and now works as a technician in a lab. He finds the job dull, and wants to become a teacher instead. But he""s scared to go back to school and take on more debt. ""I feel stuck,"" he said. He and his wife would also love to have a child, but they worry they won""t be able to afford the child-care and health expenses when they have to put $800 a month toward their student loans. ""Talk about stimulus,"" Hossfeld said, if Biden forgave their debt. ""Eight hundred dollars a month extra, for me, would be amazing,"" he said. ""It would allow me to start a family, and get a different job. ""I dream about it."" Christine Angelique of Portland, Oregon, signed the Change.org petition after her mother forwarded it to her. Her student debt balance is more than $168,000. Since Angelique graduated in 2010 with a degree in interior design from the Art Institute of Portland, she hasn""t been able to land a full-time job. The chain of for-profit colleges has come under fire for misleading students about their programs and career outcomes. ""I ended up working a lot of part-time and seasonal jobs,"" Angelique, 43, said. ""It""s been really depressing."" In 2017, she filed for bankruptcy because of her credit card debt, which she said she""d accumulated to cover bills and essentials without a steady, adequate paycheck.

cnbc|"President Joe Biden will raise the annual U.S. refugee cap to 62,500 entrants for the fiscal year, revising the much lower number set under the Trump administration that ""did not reflect America""s values,"" he said Monday. ""It is important to take this action today to remove any lingering doubt in the minds of refugees around the world who have suffered so much, and who are anxiously waiting for their new lives to begin,"" the president said in a statement. Biden also said he plans to set a cap of 125,000 refugee admissions for the following fiscal year. Read more of CNBC""s politics coverage: The Biden administration faced immense pressure from Democrats and activists to quickly raise the refugee cap from the historically low limit of 15,000 set under former President Donald Trump. After Biden signaled in mid-April he would keep the Trump-era cap in place, lawmakers in his own party publicly tore into the Democratic president. ""President Biden has broken his promise to restore our humanity,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said at the time. Soon after the backlash, the White House said that there was ""confusion"" in its messaging and vowed to address the refugee cap by May 15. Republicans, meanwhile, have slammed Biden""s handling of a surge of migrant arrivals along the U.S.-Mexico border. GOP lawmakers urged the administration to reinstate some of Trump""s strict immigration policies that Biden canceled when he took office. Media outlets also spoke out against the administration for limiting press access at reportedly overwhelmed border facilities at the height of the surge. Biden""s statement Monday afternoon said the U.S. refugee program ""embodies America""s commitment to protect the most vulnerable, and to stand as a beacon of liberty and refuge to the world."" ""It""s a statement about who we are, and who we want to be. So we are going to rebuild what has been broken and push hard to complete the rigorous screening process for those refugees already in the pipeline for admission,"" the president said.

But ""the sad truth,"" he noted, ""is that we will not achieve 62,500 admissions this year."" ""We are working quickly to undo the damage of the last four years. It will take some time, but that work is already underway. We have reopened the program to new refugees. And by changing the regional allocations last month, we have already increased the number of refugees ready for departure to the United States,"" he said. Biden also acknowledged that his goal for next year of 125,000 refugee admissions ""will still be hard to hit."" ""We might not make it the first year. But we are going to use every tool available to help these fully-vetted refugees fleeing horrific conditions in their home countries,"" he said.

How Biden""s real estate tax plan may hit smaller property investors Currently, the tax code separates single and married filers, with a top rate of 37% for individuals earning over $523,600 and couples making more than $628,300. Biden wants to increase the highest tax rate to 39.6%, impacting the ""top 1%,"" according to the White House plan outlined Wednesday. The proposal may still affect individuals making less than $400,000, however. For example, let""s say each person makes $260,000. Under Biden""s plan, those couples may pay higher taxes filing together than on their own. The measure would apply to fewer than 1% of families, the latest filing data from the IRS shows. But impacted couples may get a surprise at tax time, financial experts say. ""This creates a need for very specific analysis for married couples,"" said Alvina Lo, New York-based chief wealth strategist at Wilmington Trust. Luckily, financial experts say there""s time to prepare for any impending tax changes. If the law doesn""t kick in until 2022, Smailhodzic Lewis said to watch the timing of year-end or first-quarter income. Self-employed filers may try to accelerate 2022 income into late 2021 before the measure goes into effect. Couples over the threshold may also explore filing taxes separately. ""The way the numbers shake out, because of the way our tax system works, you can definitely get into situations where you are better off if you are single,"" said Lo. Those impacted may need to prioritize deductions, she said. Couples may consider tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) or individual retirement account to reduce income. Those itemizing tax deductions may also consider charitable gifts. ""Any deductions that you can take are going to be a lot more important,"" she said. With details still in flux, high-earners may be tempted to make portfolio changes, leveraging current capital gains rates. But Lo warns against knee-jerk reactions to the proposal. ""You really need to have a plan and be ready to pull the trigger on strategies, depending on which way the wind blows,"" she said."
cnbc|"Rep. Kevin Brady, the top tax-writing Republican in the House during the Trump administration, suggested Monday that President Joe Biden""s proposals to raise rates on corporations and the rich are nonstarters. ""I""m not sure we should be compromising by making America dramatically less competitive than our global competitors,"" Brady said on CNBC""s ""Squawk Box."" The Texas Republican, who is retiring at the end of this term after more than two decades in Congress, predicted ""there""s going to be a real fight over these tax increases"" and advocated for ""a different approach on how we pay for"" Biden""s infrastructure plan. Read more of CNBC""s politics coverage: Biden last week laid out the second part of his multitrillion-dollar plan to overhaul the U.S. economy in the wake of the devastating coronavirus pandemic. The packages aim to make huge investments in infrastructure, child care and a slew of other projects that will be paid for in part by hiking the top income tax rate to 39.6% and raising the corporate tax rate to 28%. Biden""s proposals would reverse some key pieces of the 2017 tax-cut law, which Brady, then the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, helped craft. The $1.5 trillion legislation, which cut taxes for corporations and individuals, became a key achievement of former President Donald Trump""s term in office. Brady said Republicans and Democrats in Congress can ""absolutely compromise"" on an infrastructure plan, which has ""always been a bipartisan issue."" But ""we shouldn""t be funding infrastructure on the backs of American workers,"" Brady said. He proposed that lawmakers should instead start by looking to ""recapture"" some of the wasted money in the budget and by restoring to their original purpose a number of tax provisions that used to go toward infrastructure but have been subsumed by other issues. Brady also suggested seeking private capital sources to help raise infrastructure funds. ""There are some different ways we can approach that to drive funding for infrastructure,"" Brady said. But Brady appeared to dismiss the prospect of taxing the rich, arguing that the tax code is already ""extremely progressive."" The Biden administration has called on Republicans to weigh in and offer their own proposals, while stressing that ""inaction is not an option."" But many Republicans have accused the White House of employing the rhetoric of unity while governing like partisans. Biden in March signed into law a $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill without any GOP support. Democrats hold narrow majorities in both chambers of the bitterly polarized Congress. The Senate is split 50-50 between the two parties, giving Vice President Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote. The Senate filibuster, which requires a 60-vote threshold for most legislation to be passed, keeps Democrats from pushing most of their agenda through Congress. But budget reconciliation rules allow for some bills — such as the Covid relief bill in March — to be passed with just a simple majority, and Democrats have more opportunities to use that option before the 2022 midterm elections. Many Democratic lawmakers are pushing for the Senate to end the filibuster — a move that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., warned would lead to a ""100-car pileup"" in the chamber. But some moderate Democrats, such as West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have also come out against filibuster reform. Manchin and other moderate Democrats, who in a divided Congress wield outsize influence, have also voiced concern with the trillions of dollars in spending proposed by the Biden administration. McConnell on Monday accused Democrats of destroying the limited bipartisanship that led Congress to quickly pass multiple Covid stimulus bills last year. Democrats ""just can""t resist stretching out the pandemic, using it as a rationale for additional spending,"" McConnell said in remarks at the University of Louisville. ""They want to raise the corporate rate to the highest in the world,"" McConnell added. ""We""re not going to revisit the 2017 tax bill."" Asked Monday for his prediction on how the fight will play out on Capitol Hill, Brady said, ""This is not a done deal by any means."" ""These are dramatic increases in taxes that have real impacts on jobs here in America. There""s no question in my view this is going to sabotage the jobs recovery, it will drive jobs overseas,"" he said. Raising the corporate tax rate alone ""makes America nearly dead last competitively and will drive jobs overseas, so I""m not sure we should be compromising by making America dramatically less competitive than our global competitors."" ""I think there""s going to be a real fight over these tax increases and I predict, at some point I""m hopeful there""ll be a middle ground that we find, both on infrastructure and a different approach on how we pay for it,"" Brady said."
cnbc|"Real estate investors may soon pay more taxes on high-dollar transactions. President Joe Biden is asking for higher taxes on real estate transactions with gains of more than $500,000. The tax plan aims to help cover the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan, which pumps money into child care, paid family leave and education programs. However, financial experts say the tax hike may also put a strain on smaller investors. The strategy on the chopping block — so-called like-kind or 1031 exchanges — allows investors to defer paying taxes on real estate by rolling profits into their next property. More from Personal Finance:
How Biden""s capital gains proposal may hit middle-class home sellers
Biden""s inherited real estate tax may impact more people than just the wealthy
Biden promises no new taxes salaries under $400,000. Experts have doubts ""You don""t have to take a haircut for Uncle Sam""s share every time you move from one investment to another,"" said Michael Repak, vice president and senior estate planner at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. Currently, investors can use 1031 exchanges to buy and sell tax-deferred real estate throughout life. If the investor holds the property until death, they can pass it on to heirs tax-free. ""This has been a great way for real estate investors to make money,"" said Matt Berquist, a Jacksonville, Florida-based certified financial planner and managing director at Intrepid Capital Management. The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that 1031 exchanges may save investors $41.4 billion in taxes from 2020 to 2024. Biden aims to reel in 1031 exchanges on transactions with profits exceeding $500,000. The effects may be far-reaching, financial experts say, especially with the call for an increase in capital gains taxes. About 12% of real estate sales were part of a 1031 exchange from 2016 to 2019, according to a 2020 survey from the National Association of Realtors. Those investors may not be the real estate tycoons many expect. Although Biden""s plan targets the wealthy, the proposal may also hit smaller investors. The Realtors survey showed 84% of 1031 exchanges were by smaller investors — those in sole proprietorships (47%) or S corporations (37%). ""There will be some unintended consequences if it all goes through,"" Berquist said. Small businesses looking to exchange property may face some tough decisions. For example, let""s say a dental practice owns a $1.2 million building it had originally purchased for $500,000. Under current law, the owners can exchange the property for a ""like-kind"" office building and defer taxes by adding the $700,000 profit into a new building they""ve bought. The new law would charge capital gains taxes on the company""s profit above the $500,000 exemption. Repak said the new rule could make it difficult for those looking to exchange for a lower-maintenance property as they move into retirement. The proposed changes may also trickle down to small businesses renting property. Sixty-eight percent of those surveyed by the Realtors expect rent increases if 1031 exchange repeals occur. Repak said landlords may try to recoup losses or extra taxes by charging more rent.    

""Renters are probably the easiest to try and push that onto,"" he said. While details are still murky, Repak said some investors are starting to prepare for changes. He said it""s prudent to begin talking with your estate planning attorney and accountant. Those impacted shouldn""t make an impulsive decision, however. ""There are all kinds of things on the docket that could change for folks,"" Berquist said. ""People need to be ready and open to making changes as necessary."""
cnbc|"The latest economic recovery plan from President Joe Biden significantly expands school lunch programs for children. If passed, it would provide free school lunch during summer break to 29 million children. The $1.8 trillion American Families Plan, unveiled by Biden in late April, includes $45 billion to enlarge certain nutrition programs that assist families with children, many of whom have struggled with food insecurity amid the coronavirus pandemic. More from Invest in You:
You can still tap free money for college — here""s how
How I learned about investing in stocks - and you can, too
College students get career experience as social media brand ambassadors The bulk of that money, some $25 billion, is to be allocated to making summer electronic benefit transfers, or EBT, a permanent program. During Covid, the pandemic-EBT program sent money to families of students receiving free or reduced-price school lunch when school was not in session, including summer vacations. ""Expanding this program, not just during pandemic times when schools are closed, but when we always know that schools are closed — which is the summer — is both evidence-based and a welcome change from how we do business,"" said to Lauren Bauer, a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution and associated with The Hamilton Project. In an average month, the pandemic-EBT program gives an additional $114 per child to families, on top of any other supplemental nutrition assistance program, or SNAP, benefits they receive. The nutrition benefits are the latest legislative moves to combat the food insecurity that has spiked amid the coronavirus pandemic. In December 2020, former President Donald Trump signed a $900 billion stimulus bill that increased SNAP benefits 15% across the board. The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan signed in by Biden in March expanded that 15% boost in SNAP benefits through September and gave states more flexibility to provide pandemic assistance to children younger than 6 that are not yet in school. ""One of the defining images, at least from my perspective, in this crisis has been cars lined up, cars lined up for miles,"" said Biden during an April 28 speech to Congress. ""Nice cars, lined up for miles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk."" The American Families Plan will also invest $17 billion in the Community Eligibility Provision, a program which allows schools in high-poverty areas to give students free lunch. The bill would lower the threshold to apply for the benefit. Of the additional 9.3 million children who would get free meals from the expansion, 70% would be in elementary school. It would also relax eligibility rules for SNAP. Under Biden""s proposal, all individuals convicted of a drug-related felony would be eligible to receive such benefits – currently, many of these individuals cannot get SNAP unless their state has modified or removed the restriction. This disproportionately impacts families of color, and especially Black Americans, who see higher rates of conviction for drug-related offenses than their white counterparts. ""These are moms who are coming back to families with kids and trying to get their homes up and running again,"" said Bauer, adding that children of such formerly incarcerated individuals are still eligible for SNAP, but that it stretches the already too-small benefit thin. To be sure, instituting a permanent summer program wouldn""t start right away, as other provisions are in place to provide meals to children during Covid. Pandemic food help will continue through the 2021-2022 school year and summer and could go on even longer, as it""s tied to the Covid public health emergency declaration In addition, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced in April that all children will receive universal free school lunch through June 30, 2022 due to the pandemic. The provision in Biden""s plan would kick in after that, making the benefit available to millions of children every summer.

cnbc|"President Joe Biden""s American Families Plan would cost far more than the White House estimates, and it would increase government debt while decreasing GDP, according to a study released Wednesday. The administration""s latest stimulus plan, which officials priced at $1.8 trillion, would actually cost American taxpayers $2.5 trillion over the 10-year budget window, about $700 billion more than the White House""s estimate, the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimated. The school explained that the sizable difference in headline cost projections is thanks to a disagreement over how much the plan""s tax credits, as well as the universal pre-K and free community college provisions, would require. Meanwhile, the study said that Biden""s proposed revenue-raising procedures would fail to drum up the funds to cover the cost of the expansive stimulus. Wharton said that the totality of current revenue-generating proposals to help pay for the bill would fall short at $1.3 trillion. The study broke down how much each of Biden""s revenue-raising proposals would add to baseline revenues over a 10-year period: The Wharton study found that the American Families Plan would increase government debt by almost 5% by 2050 and decrease GDP by 0.4%, as the effects from larger debt on the economy outweigh the productivity gains associated with the new spending programs. The White House declined to comment, but referred CNBC to a study published Monday by Moody""s Analytics and economist Mark Zandi. Zandi, who advised progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., during her presidential campaign, wrote for Moody""s that while the Families plan near-term impacts are small, it provides ""meaningful longer-term economic benefits"" as more Americans return to work and attain higher levels of education. There are a number of differences between the Wharton study and Zandi""s, including how far each looks into the future to estimate how the Biden plan would affect the U.S. economy. Zandi focuses his report to the next 10 years, whereas the Wharton report attempts to gauge how continued spending would influence economic growth in the long term. While Zandi touts the benefits of an economy unfettered by the bonds of child care and the potential to bring more women back into labor force, Wharton argues that spending on education, child care and paid increases government debt up 11.6% in 2050 and becomes a net drag on GDP. While Wharton found that better tax compliance measures would generate an additional $480 billion over ten years, Zandi puts that number around $700 billion. Read more of CNBC""s politics coverage: The findings could complicate the president""s bid to enact a sweeping piece of legislation that, if passed, would channel hundreds of billions of dollars to child care, education and health care. Among its many provisions, the Biden proposal seeks to fund universal preschool, a federal paid leave program, efforts to make child care more affordable and free community college for all. The White House said the $1.8 trillion would be split between $1 trillion in spending and $800 billion in tax credits. As another multitrillion-dollar piece of legislation, the administration says it plans to pay for the American Families Plan with new taxes on high-income households and by increasing IRS enforcement. He would like to raise the top rate on income taxes to 39.6% from 37%. Further, Biden is proposing a hike to the long-term capital gains rate to 39.6%. Currently, the top rate on those gains is 20%. The increase would apply to households making over $1 million. Even before the Wharton study, the package faced many more hurdles than Biden""s American Jobs Plan, a $2.2 trillion physical infrastructure proposal. While Republicans have a litany of problems with Biden""s infrastructure plan, they have expressed far less interest in additional spending for education, child care and paid leave than they have for building roads and bridges. The GOP has also protested against several of the tax proposals included in Biden""s Families and Jobs plans, including an increase to the corporate, income and capital gains tax rates."
cnbc|"President Joe Biden""s allies in the business community have been helping the White House try to coax the private sector into supporting the administration""s climate change agenda. Several business leaders who are working with the White House told CNBC that the effort is a major divergence from what they saw during the Trump administration. For instance, executives say they are less worried about a tweet from the president if they try to make a push for new climate policies. Former President Donald Trump was known to target corporations that appeared to oppose him on key issues. ""There""s no longer the fear of the tweet, which I think was a legitimate fear from a lot of the business leaders in trying to speak out on these issues,"" Hugh Welsh, president of DSM North America, which is a member of the group CEO Climate Dialogue, told CNBC on Monday. Unlike Trump, Biden has proposed an aggressive climate change policy. Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement in 2017 and lifted Obama-era regulations on methane gas, among other actions that could end up hurting the environment. Biden brought the U.S. back into the Paris climate agreement on his Inauguration Day. Biden has also made addressing climate change a key part of his $2 trillion infrastructure plan. Biden""s proposal pushes for a $174 billion investment in the electric vehicle market. It""s all part of the president""s goal to get the country to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Tom Steyer, a billionaire who ran for president during the Democratic primary, is among several business leaders who have been actively engaging the White House and administration leaders on their climate proposals. Steyer has been speaking with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and White House climate advisor Gina McCarthy on the need to work with the private sector on what will likely be one of the president""s most expensive initiatives, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Steyer spent millions to defeat Trump and has invested in climate change initiatives. He has a net worth of $1.4 billion, according to Forbes. He was also a speaker at Morgan Stanley""s annual climate conference, this person noted. Steyer told executives and investors at the meeting that they shouldn""t invest in fossil fuel companies, as a way to combat climate change. This person declined to be named in order to discuss private matters. Representatives for Morgan Stanley did not respond to requests for comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment before publication. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the CEO Climate Dialogue have also been engaging the White House on climate initiatives. The Chamber opposes Biden""s plan to raise corporate taxes, but it backs an infrastructure overhaul. The CEO Climate Dialogue has almost two dozen members including companies from Wall Street and the energy sector. The goal of the organization is to promote the use of the private sector and a more market-based approach to securing net-zero emissions by 2050. Welsh, of CEO Climate Dialogue, told CNBC that the group has been in touch with the Biden White House to help improve relations with corporate leaders. ""The group has been involved with Gina McCarthy and some of the others in, I guess, rebuilding relationships with the White House after the last four years,"" Welsh said. Marty Durbin, president of the Chamber of Commerce""s Global Energy Institute, told CNBC that the group has been in touch with McCarthy and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. Durbin said the chamber has been trying to encourage Granholm and members of Congress to fully fund climate-based research and development projects. The group also has been looking to encourage the new administration to work with the private sector on green policy proposals. ""We""ve got to figure out how do we allow the private sector to be in a position to finance, deploy and commercialize these technologies. That""s how we are going to see emission reductions at the end of the day,"" Durbin said. Members of a fundraising group called Clean Energy for Biden are also acting as a bridge to the private sector. Dan Reicher, a co-chairman of the organization, told CNBC that he helped outline a spending proposal to increase energy output from the nation""s dams. The document, which was sent to the White House and endorsed by nearly a dozen organizations and trade associations, says that only 2,500 of the approximately 90,000 dams in the United States generate electricity. ""If fully enacted, this $63.07 billion proposal for spending, over 10 years, will create approximately 500,000 good-paying jobs, restore over 20,000 miles of rivers enhancing their climate resilience, and secure more than 80 gigawatts of existing renewable hydropower and 23 gigawatts of electricity storage,"" the proposal says. It also calls for Biden to order the creation of a committee to coordinate on dam improvements and regulatory issues. Reicher said the outline was sent to Phil Giudice and David Hayes, two of Biden""s climate policy advisors, and members of Congress, among others. The Clean Energy for Biden group is evolving into 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) nonprofits, both called Clean Energy for America, Reicher added. The Clean Energy for America website said that while backing Biden""s climate agenda it will also be ""supporting candidates at federal, state, and local level through fundraising, mobilizing the clean energy workforce, and serving as an early resource."""
cnbc|"President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced his administration""s latest goals in the fight against the coronavirus: getting 70% of U.S. adults to receive at least one dose of a Covid vaccine and having 160 million adults fully vaccinated by July 4. The new vaccination targets came two months out from Independence Day, a date the White House hopes will mark a turning point in the pandemic. ""If we succeed in this effort,"" Biden said at the White House, ""then Americans will have taken a serious step toward a return to normal."" In a background call with reporters earlier Tuesday, senior administration officials also said the White House will change the way it allocates vaccines to states. Covid vaccines that go unused or unwanted by some states will be redistributed to others, officials said. In order to administer tens of millions more inoculations in the next 61 days, the president will take additional steps to encourage more people to get vaccinated and make it easier for them to do so, officials said. Biden will direct thousands of local pharmacies to provide walk-in vaccinations to people without appointments, an official said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will also support pop-up and mobile clinics, which are aimed at individuals who may otherwise have trouble reaching vaccination sites. Read CNBC""s latest coverage of the Covid pandemic: India foreign minister self-isolating after Covid scare at UK""s in-person G-7 summit Why India — the world""s biggest producer of Covid vaccines — has a major shortage of doses Biden""s new Covid vaccination goal is for 70% of adults to have at least one shot by July 4 Pfizer scientist expects elderly, people with underlying conditions to be first to get Covid booster shots The White House is also preparing to ""be able to mobilize immediately"" if the Food and Drug Administration approves Pfizer""s Covid vaccine for people ages 12-15 for emergency use, an official said. The administration officials also said more funding from the $1.9 trillion Covid relief law will be allocated toward rural health clinics and hospitals. The administration""s new efforts appear to be aimed in part at tackling the issue of vaccine hesitancy. A Monmouth University poll published in mid-April, for instance, found that about 1 in 5 Americans say they won""t get a shot. The new goal comes as the pace of daily shots slows, down to an average of 2.3 million reported vaccinations per day as of Monday from a high of 3.4 million on April 13. As of Monday, more than 145 million Americans age 18 and older, or 56.3% of the total adult population, have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Roughly 104.7 million Americans age 18 and older, or 40.6% of the total adult population, are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Reaching the 70% figure does not mean the U.S. has achieved so-called herd immunity against the virus, the officials noted on the call. Some health experts have argued that between 70% and 85% of the U.S. population needs to be vaccinated against Covid to achieve herd immunity – the point at which enough people in a given community have antibodies against a specific disease. But one official said herd immunity is actually more ""elusive"" and the U.S. should just focus on vaccinating as many people as possible to drive down hospitalizations and deaths. ""Covid-19 is going to vary in its degree and dynamics by community,"" according to the official. ""So each community must individually strive to reach the goal of vaccinating 70% of his population by July 4."" Biden, who made Covid his main focus when he took office Jan. 20, previously identified July 4 as a significant date in the United States"" fight against the pandemic. In his first prime-time address to the nation in March, Biden set a goal for Americans to be able to gather in person with their friends and loved ones in small groups to celebrate the holiday. ""If we all do our part, this country will be vaccinated soon, our economy will be on the mend, our kids will be back in school, and we""ll have proven once again that this country can do anything,"" Biden said at that time."
cnbc|"In his first 100 days in office, President Joe Biden signed into law a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, put forward a multitrillion-dollar plan to overhaul the economy and unilaterally reversed course on many of his predecessor""s policies. Biden took the reins from former President Donald Trump amid the coronavirus pandemic and under a cloud of nationwide social and political unrest. When he took office Jan. 20, Biden vowed to shepherd the nation through an unprecedented ""winter of peril"" and set it on a path toward unity. As he approached his 100th full day on the job, Biden this week declared that America is ""leading the world again."" Here""s a look at what""s happened in Biden""s first 100 days. Even before taking office, Biden pledged to build a diverse Cabinet that would ""look like America."" He""s living up to that commitment, according to Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a presidential scholar and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has been tracking Biden""s appointees. The Biden administration is pacing ahead of recent predecessors with a greater share of Senate-confirmed women and nonwhite appointees at the 100-day mark than former presidents Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush had at their 300-day marks, according to Brookings"" tracker. The data was last updated on Wednesday and covers confirmations to the 15 departments in the line of presidential succession, and excludes some departments such as U.S. attorneys as well as military appointments. The high-profile positions that minorities have been appointed to also reflect Biden""s commitment to diversity, Tenpas said. ""It""s not just that the numbers are showing he""s appointed more women and nonwhites, but he""s putting them in positions they""ve never occupied before,"" she said. Biden""s Cabinet includes Lloyd Austin, the country""s first Black Defense secretary; Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay person to hold a Cabinet position; Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, the first Native American Cabinet secretary; Janet Yellen, the first woman to head the Treasury Department; and Xavier Becerra, the first Latino secretary of Health and Human Services. Historically, Tenpas said, women and minorities have often been appointed to less-visible positions, such as with the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Housing and Urban Development and Labor Department. The first 100 days are typically a preliminary look at administration appointments, Tenpas noted. A president""s second 100-day period is often more productive in terms of Senate confirmations, which will be another opportunity to check in on Biden""s diversity pledge. Biden took office amid the peak of the Covid crisis, when the country was reporting nearly 200,000 Covid cases and more than 3,000 deaths per day. He set an initial goal of 100 million vaccine shots administered in 100 days, which drew criticism for being too conservative. The White House reached that mark in 58 days and set a new target of 200 million shots, which was surpassed on day 92. More than half of U.S. adults have received at least one dose, according to Centers for Disease Prevention and Control and Prevention data, and all are now eligible to be vaccinated. But the pace of daily shots has slid in recent weeks, down to an average of 2.6 million daily reported vaccinations from a peak of 3.4 million in mid-April. The major stock market indexes have soared during Biden""s tenure, with S&P 500 gains during his first 100 days stronger than those of any president going back to at least the 1950s and the Eisenhower administration. Bolstered by record levels of stimulus, the index has risen by 25% since Election Day, part of a continued rally that began in late March 2020 after the coronavirus crash, and has shown few signs of slowing down since. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 23.9% over that period and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has climbed 26.2%. The Biden rally hit a blip when news broke on April 22 that the president is planning a capital gains tax hike on the wealthy, with the S&P 500 and Dow closing down nearly a full percentage point each. Stocks quickly recovered their losses, though, and the White House brushed off a question related to investors"" concern about the tax proposal. ""I""ve been doing this long enough not to comment on movements in the stock market,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a press briefing on April 23, adding ""but I did see data, factually, that it went back up this morning."" The market has been somewhat volatile under Biden, at least by historical standards. The S&P 500 rose or fell by 1% or more on 31 of the days between the Election Day and Biden""s 100th day, compared with five days under Trump""s initial period in the White House. Considering the political moment he stepped into, Biden""s approval rating has so far been strong. But it""s unclear whether his numbers will stay above water, as he and his party gear up for a series of major policy fights that could define the rest of his presidency. Biden""s approval rating sits at 57% after 100 days, according to Gallup data, making him way more popular than Trump was. But that""s not saying much: Trump""s rating at this point – 41% – was 14 points lower than any other president in Gallup""s history. The president""s Republican predecessor maintained historically low approval numbers throughout his one term in office, never cracking the 50% threshold, Gallup polling shows. Compared with other presidents, Biden""s rating is less impressive. He""s ranked third-lowest of any president since Dwight Eisenhower at the 100-day mark, according to Gallup. Americans tend to give Biden his lowest marks on his handling of China, guns and immigration. Still, it""s notable that Biden is garnering positive ratings at a time of extreme political polarization. Gallup""s latest survey shows Biden with just 11% approval among Republicans, but he nets 58% approval from independents. At this point in Trump""s presidency, just 37% of independents gave him a thumbs up, Gallup shows. Biden""s approval appears to be buoyed largely by his administration""s decision to focus intently on Covid from Day 1. Americans still see the coronavirus as one of the most pressing issues facing the country, and several polls show Biden receiving highest marks for his handling of the pandemic. Biden pushed hard for Congress to pass the $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan, which many more Americans support than oppose. But there""s also more of an appetite for the sort of big-ticket government spending that the administration has put forward. Fifty-five percent of respondents in a recent NBC News survey, for instance, said the government should do more to solve problems and help meet the peoples"" needs, versus 41% who said it""s doing too much. Even before the White House detailed Biden""s latest spending plan — a $1.8 trillion package aimed at helping children, students and families — nearly two-thirds of respondents in a Monmouth University poll said they backed the idea. Experts say it makes sense that Biden""s economic proposals — presented in their loftiest, most ambitious form — seem to resonate with Americans. But those plans are bound to change drastically once lawmakers get ahold of his agenda, and it""s unclear what Congress will be able to pass. Democrats hold a slim majority in the House, and a razor-thin advantage in the Senate. The filibuster rules in the Senate requires 60 votes for much legislation to be passed, and Democrats"" ability to bypass that hurdle through budget reconciliation can be used only sparingly. Biden has repeatedly said he seeks bipartisan input, while stressing that inaction on his agenda is not an option. But there""s little indication that Republicans will support anything like Biden""s plans in their current form. In addition, some moderate-to-conservative-leaning Democrats, such as Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, are already voicing skepticism about the spending push."

MARK LEVIN: The purpose of immigration is not to support the country from which the immigrant comes from or even the immigrant. The purpose of immigration has historically been what's in the best interest of the American people. But when you believe the American people are systemically racist you don't really care what's in the best interest of the American people. The Democrat Party does not love this country. As a matter of fact, as each day goes by demonstrates that it hates this country, so does the president of the United States. You listen to that state of confusion speech it was abundantly clear. He never talked about liberty. He never talked about personal responsibility. He never talked about unalienable rights. He never talked about property rights. He never talked about the things upon which this nation was based. Joe Biden, the Democrat party want to fundamentally change America. If you want to fundamentally change something you don't like it, as a matter of fact, you hate it. Massive taxation, massive regulation, massive spending, massive debt. They are igniting inflation as we speak. Wide-open southern border. You have MS-13, drugs pouring across the border. You have massive child abuse going on there and Joe Biden doesn't give a damn. They pick the teachers union and muscle of that union over educating our children. They are undermining our police and our military. They are pushing racism in our schools so people are constantly at each other's throats. They are strengthening the regime in Iran which threatens to shoot nuclear missiles at us once they acquire them. He""s Biden kowtowing to the communist Chinese. He aims to destroy the Supreme Court, pack the Senate, and eviscerate election laws. Does this sound like a man and a party that love this country? I don't think so. On this immigration front, assimilation. A country simply cannot survive if its culture, if its principles are not shared by the citizens. A country simply cannot survive in our elementary school students and middle school students and high school students are being taught racism packaged as something else. Our colleges and universities are hot beds of old soviet propaganda. Now, we have to claw our way back, but it begins first by identifying exactly what's going on. This isn't democratic socialism, this isn't liberalism. This isn't progressivism. This is an American form of Marxism where have you oppressors and oppressed.

fox_news|"The former vice president defends his electability during a campaign event in New Hampshire after being questioned about taking fourth place in Iowa. Presidential contender Joe Biden jokingly called a college student in New Hampshire a ""lying, dog-faced pony soldier"" during a campaign event on Sunday, just two months after he unloaded on an Iowa voter whom he called a ""damn liar"" and days after he dryly instructed a climate activist to ""go vote for someone else."" The campaign trail headscratchers came as Biden, 77, has gone on the offensive following his disappointing fourth-place finish in last week's disastrous Iowa caucuses, well behind rivals Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The student, Madison, of Mercer University in Georgia, began by asking Biden how he could remain competitive in the race after that performance. ""It's a good question,"" Biden responded. ""Number one: Iowa's a democratic caucus. You ever been to a caucus? No you haven't. You're a lying, dog-faced pony soldier. You said you were; but now you got to be honest. I'm gonna be honest with you. It was a little bit confusing in Iowa."" Biden had used the bizarre phrase in January as well, in response to a question about President Obama's broken promise that individuals would be guaranteed the option to keep their doctors under the Affordable Care Act. At a 2018 campaign event, Biden offered some hints as to the origin of the phrase, remarking, ""As my brother who loves to use lines from movies, from John Wayne movies, there""s a line in a movie, a John Wayne movie where an Indian chief turns to John Wayne and says, 'This is a lying, dog-faced pony soldier.'"" But, TMZ first reported that the phrase may in fact have come from the 1952 Tyrone Power film called ""Pony Soldier."" Still, no line in the movie includes the full phrase, ""lying, dog-faced pony soldier."" (""The pony soldier speaks with the tongue of the snake that rattles,"" a character says at one point.) However, in the 1949 John Wayne film ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,"" a narrator at the end of the film does say part of the phrase Biden uttered: ""dog-faced soldiers."" It is not directed explicitly at a character played by Wayne, and it is intended as a compliment. ""So here they are: the dog-faced soldiers, the regulars, the 50-cents-a-day professionals, riding the outposts of the nation,"" the narrator says. ""From Fort Reno to Fort Apache, from Sheridan to Stark, they were all the same: men in dirty-shirt blue, and only a cold page in the history books to mark their passing. But wherever they rode, and whatever they fought for, that place became the United States."" Fox News spoke with the Mercer University student, 21-year-old Madison Moore, after the episode -- and she said Biden had correctly identified her fib about attending a caucus. ""I felt he did give some good answers,"" Moore said. ""It was a little awkward being put on the spot. But he was right. I haven't been to a caucus. I kind of caved in the moment. So he's right. He's right there. But he's right about the black vote, too. I mean, it's very important. And the results have shown that people think he doesn't have that support. So I'm still very skeptical, but I thought he did a good job answering."" ""You're a lying, dog-faced pony soldier."" Nevertheless, the moment drew mockery from conservatives and other commentators. ""If he can""t handle a simple question from one of his own supporters, how can Joe Biden possibly take on Donald Trump one on one for six months?"" asked Donald Trump, Jr., on Twitter. George Washington University law professor and GOP impeachment witness Jonathan Turley added: ""Hmmm, Biden does not appear to be confining his 'go negative' strategy to Pete Buttigieg, but seems to think it will work with voters. Calling a voter 'a lying dog-faced pony soldier' must be a new voter suppression strategy by targeting your own voters."" Also in New Hampshire, Biden forcefully echoed failed presidential contender Eric Swalwell in dismissing Second Amendment advocates, claiming personal gun ownership is an ineffective defense against government tyranny. (In an infamous tweet, Swalwell informed a gun-rights proponent that the government ""has nukes"" and could defeat an uprising in a ""short war."") ""Those who say 'the tree of liberty is watered with the blood of patriots' -- a great line, well, guess what: The fact is, if you""re going to take on the government you need an F-15 with Hellfire Missiles,"" Biden said. ""There is no way an AK-47 is going to take care of you, if you're worried about the government coming and knocking down your door."" Biden's defensiveness on the campaign trail has raised questions about his possible electability issues, especially given President Trump's propensity for hammering the Bidens' perceived corruption. This past December in Iowa, Biden slammed a voter who questioned Hunter Biden's business dealings as a ""damn liar"" who needed to take an ""IQ test."" The former vice president then seemingly called the man ""fat"" after deriding him for his self-professed sedentary lifestyle, although the Biden campaign said there was a misunderstanding. Biden has stepped up his aggressiveness in recent days, although his attacks have been increasingly directed not just at individual voters, but also other rivals for the White House. ""This guy's not a Barack Obama. Barack Obama had been a United States senator of a really large state,"" Biden said this weekend, referring to Buttigieg. ""This is a very different situation."" Biden spoke with reporters hours after his campaign went up with a new digital ad suggesting the 38-year old candidate -- who's nearly four decades younger than Biden -- didn't have enough experience to be president. The spot used a clip of then-President Obama calling Biden ""the best vice president America's ever had,"" before going on to compare arguable successes of the Obama administration with mundane mayoral actions by Buttigieg, such as installing ""decorative lights under bridges."" Buttigieg's team, in response, argued: ""Vice President""s decision to run this ad speaks more to where he currently stands in this race than it does about Pete""s perspective as a mayor and veteran."" Asked about his campaign""s digital video, Biden explained: ""What I""m doing is responding to what Pete""s been saying for the last two months, that all the problems we have today are from the recent past."" BIDEN MOCKS BUTTIGIEG IN NEW DIGITAL VIDEO ""When you get attacked, you have to respond. I kept my mouth shut for a long time. I haven""t responded at all. But it""s been constant, a constant assertion that the problems we""re facing today are somehow because of our administration. That""s simply not true,"" Biden said.

fox_news|"Joe Biden faces backlash for suggesting during an interview with host Charlamagne tha God that those having a hard time ""figuring out"" whether to support him or Trump ""ain't black;"" Fox News contributor Karl Rove reacts. Joe Biden faced a swift backlash on Friday for suggesting during a contentious radio interview with host Charlamagne tha God that those having a hard time ""figuring out"" whether to support him or President Trump ""ain't black."" The dustup occurred 17 minutes into the former vice president's interview on ""The Breakfast Club"" – a nationally broadcast morning talk show popular with black listeners – when a Biden aide tried to end the interview, prompting the host to charge, ""You can""t do that to black media."" FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN MORE TRUSTED ON CORONAVIRUS The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee stressed that his wife had an upcoming engagement, and suggested he would have to go whether dealing with ""white media"" or ""black media."" ""Uh, oh ... I""m in trouble,"" he joked as he referred to making his wife late. Biden and his wife Jill Biden share the same studio in the basement of their home in Wilmington, Del. After Charlamagne tha God, who is black, then asked Biden to come back on the program again and the former vice president agreed, the host added, ""It""s a long way to November. We""ve got more questions."" That""s when Biden dove into a rapid-fire defense of his record with the black community. ""I tell you if you have a problem figuring out whether you""re for me or Trump, then you ain""t black,"" he said. It's unclear whether Biden meant to refer only to the host or to the black community as a whole. POOL REPORTER BOOTED FROM BIDEN FUNDRAISING CALL Charlamagne tha God responded that ""it has nothing to do with Trump. It has to do with the fact that I want something for my community."" Biden fired back, ""Take a look at my record. I extended the Voting Rights Act for 25 years. I have a record that is second to none. The NAACP""s endorsed me every time I""ve run. Take a look at the record."" After the friction, the interview – which was pre-taped on Thursday – ended on a mutually positive note with Biden again agreeing that he ""will come back."" But the ""You ain't black"" moment reverberated on social media, with the host retweeting a variety of listeners complaining about it. Biden ""should never say to a black man 'You aint black' under ANY circumstances,"" one wrote. ""The Breakfast Club"" put the question to listeners on whether they agree with Biden: President Trump's campaign, meanwhile, quickly highlighted the clip, tweeting, ""This is disgusting."" Trump senior adviser Katrina Pierson called the remarks ""racist and dehumanizing,"" saying Biden believes black voters are ""incapable of being independent or free thinking."" She added: ""He truly believes that he, a 77-year-old white man, should dictate how Black people should behave. Biden has a history of racial condescension and today he once again proved what a growing number of Black Americans and I have always known: Joe Biden does not deserve our votes."" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh spotlighted a quote from Kanye West, a prominent African-American supporter of the president, saying, ""I will not be told who I""m gonna vote on because of my color."" But Biden campaign adviser Symone Sanders defended the comments, stressing Biden's record with the black community and saying: ""The comments made at the end of the Breakfast Club interview were in jest, but let""s be clear about what the VP was saying: he was making the distinction that he would put his record with the African American community up against Trump""s any day. Period."" Pierson, in a Trump campaign conference call with reporters, fired back that Biden's comment ""wasn""t in jest. He was serious."" And Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina -- the only black GOP senator and a supporter of the president -- said ""I won""t even dignify that with a response"" when asked about Sanders' comment that Biden was joking. Pierson, when asked by Fox News if Trump had ever been a guest on ""The Breakfast Club"" or if there were now plans to have the president do an interview on the program, said ""the president has not been on The Breakfast Club, I'm not sure that he's been invited."" She added that ""I'm not opposed to it you know, I think it's a place that we should go."" Biden has enjoyed widespread support among black voters, not just in general election polls – Fox News polling shows black voters favor Biden over Trump by 76-12 percent – but during the primary battle. His victory in the South Carolina primary, boosted by black voters' support, helped revive his then-struggling campaign and catapult him toward a dominating performance on Super Tuesday. Meanwhile, this is not the first time a 2020 contender has questioned the party affiliation of a particular race or religion. Last year, President Trump faced a backlash for saying American Jews who support Democrats show ""either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty."" He was pointing to anyone supporting Reps.

fox_news|"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has defeated President Trump, denying him a second term after a bitter campaign and dramatic, prolonged vote count in battleground states that sparked a flurry of lawsuits. The Fox News Decision Desk projected Saturday that Biden will win the state of Nevada and the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, giving the former vice president the electoral votes he needs to win the White House. ELECTION 2020 LIVE UPDATES: FOX NEWS PROJECTS BIDEN WINS PRESIDENCY ""I am honored and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me and in Vice President-elect Harris,"" Biden said in a statement. ""In the face of unprecedented obstacles, a record number of Americans voted. Proving once again, that democracy beats deep in the heart of America.""

He added: ""With the campaign over, it""s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation."" Biden's campaign announced that the president-elect and Harris, his running mate, will speak at an event in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware at 8 p.m. ET. A year and a half after launching his White House bid, Biden secured enough states to put him over the threshold of 270 electoral votes and bring an end to the four game-changing years of the Trump presidency, according to the Fox News projections. For Trump, the defeat comes four years after a stunning upset – when he came from behind in 2016 and outperformed the polls in a victory against Hillary Clinton. But in a statement Saturday, Trump did not concede and instead vowed to continue to fight. ""The simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor,"" the president said. ""Beginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated,"" Trump added. The president has launched a number of legal challenges over ballot counting in key battleground states, with his campaign filing suits in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Nevada as the states continue to tally ballots sent by mail. Trump, his campaign and surrogates have spread allegations of fraud in the voting and ballot counting in various states, although solid proof of it has not emerged. In addition, Georgia""s secretary of state signaled Friday that the state is headed toward a recount, given the razor-thin margin of votes there favoring Biden. Biden, taking to Twitter after the projections, said ""America, I""m honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country. The work ahead of us will be hard, but I promise you this: I will be a President for all Americans — whether you voted for me or not. I will keep the faith that you have placed in me."" And Biden added ""President-Elect"" to the description on his Twitter page. Harris, who will become the first female vice president and first person of color to serve as vice president, tweeted ""We did it."" The senator from California""s tweet included a short video of her on a phone call congratulating Biden. On Friday, the former vice president touted the record-breaking 74 million votes for the Democratic ticket and emphasized that ""the people spoke loudly for our ticket."" Biden highlighted that a ""record number of Americans of all races, faiths, religions, chose change over more of the same. They""ve given us a mandate for action on COVID, the economy, climate change, systemic racism. They""ve made it clear they want the country to come together."" But many Republicans question the strength of Biden's mandate. Trump won more than 70 million votes, and as of late Friday night Biden's national popular vote margin over the president stood at just under 3 points. And while Biden moved closer to winning the White House, the Democrats' chances of retaking the Senate majority remained slim. Democrats did hold onto control of the House but failed to meet expectations of padding their majority. About an hour after the news networks projected Biden""s presidential election victory, he received a congratulatory call from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader. With strong focus on coronavirus since the worst pandemic in a century swept across the nation eight months ago, Biden was able to keep the spotlight on the president""s record, largely preventing Trump from making the 2020 campaign a choice election. Amid national protests and unrest over racial inequity and another nasty Supreme Court nomination battle in the closing days of the campaign, Biden kept his eye on the pandemic and an economy hit hard by it. TRUMP VOWS TO KEEP ""FIGHTING,"" WILL USE ""EVERY ASPECT OF THE LAW"" IN BALLOT-COUNTING BATTLE Biden, who laid low for the first couple of months after the pandemic forced Americans to self-isolate, was ridiculed by the president, who claimed he was ""hiding"" in his basement at his home in Wilmington, Del. But ultimately the strategy worked -- keeping the electorate""s focus on the president's handling of the worsening crisis. Also highlighting Trump""s divisive style of governing, the Democrat pledged to be a uniter willing to reach across the aisle to find common ground. Biden was able to resist withering attacks by Trump and his surrogates over his record in politics stretching nearly half a century. He also deflected a barrage of attacks targeting him and his son, Hunter, that accused the Biden family of unsubstantiated ""corruption."" The road ahead for the president-elect, who will soon turn 78, will be far from easy. He must cope with titanic challenges never faced to this magnitude by an incoming commander in chief. Compounding the enormous task ahead, Biden likely will have to deal with a Republican Party that may be in no mood to compromise – and with a progressive base of his own party that will almost certainly try to push the incoming president to the left. Biden""s victory comes five years after he passed on a White House run, as he reeled from the death of his eldest son, Beau. A year later, Clinton narrowly lost numerous key battleground states to Trump due in part to a drop in support from White working class voters as well as a lack of enthusiasm from Black and Latino voters. But Biden – who""s long been known as ""Middle Class Joe"" because of his roots growing up in a working-class family in Scranton, Pa., and later in Delaware, and who served for eight years as vice president under Barack Obama, America""s first Black president -- was able to succeed where Clinton failed. For Biden, who made unsuccessful White House bids in 1988 and 2008, the third time was the charm. BIDEN TRANSITION TEAM'S WORK UNDERWAY ""The core values of this nation, our standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America America is at stake,"" Biden said as he announced his candidacy for president in April of last year, ending months of intrigue and media speculation. Biden entered a record-setting, jam-packed field of contenders for the nomination and repeatedly took attacks from his more progressive rivals over his stance on the issues and his record during his four-plus decades as a senator from Delaware and vice president in the Obama administration. During summer and fall 2019, Biden was in the line of fire as the front-runner in the race. Biden, who had struggled with fundraising since his campaign launch, saw his standing in the polls deteriorate at the end of last year and early this year, as progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, soared. The former vice president appeared on the ropes in February, after disappointing showings in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, the first two contests in the presidential nomination calendar. But a landslide victory in the South Carolina primary on the last day of February, followed by sweeping victories three days later in the coast-to-coast Super Tuesday contests, vaulted Biden back to front-runner status. Most of his rivals quickly dropped out of the race as moderates and establishment Democrats rallied around Biden. After a continued streak of primary victories in March and early April, Sanders – Biden""s last rival for the nomination – ended his bid and endorsed his rival. Biden entered a general election contest against Trump badly behind the GOP incumbent in the crucial fundraising and campaign organization metrics. At the same time, the White House race instantly was upended as the pandemic swept the nation, forcing millions to self-isolate and shuttering major parts of the economy, triggering the worst recession since the Great Depression eight decades ago. GEORGIA SENATE RACE: PERDUE, OSSOFF HEAD TO RUNOFF AFTER HIGHLY COMPETITIVE CAMPAIGN As Biden was working to unite the Democrats following a bruising primary, the general showdown between him and Trump instantly became a referendum on the president""s handling of the pandemic and the economy, giving Biden a race he could win. Biden spent the remainder of the spring, summer and fall continuously pillorying the president""s efforts to combat the coronavirus and revive the economy, and spelling out his proposals. The president had been raising money for his reelection ever since he took over the White House in January 2017, and he enjoyed a massive early fundraising advantage. As Trump started airing ads on TV in the key battlegrounds, Biden remained dark. The Democrat didn""t make his first major ad buy on television until the middle of June. But thanks in part to a surge in fundraising in late spring through summer, including record-shattering campaign cash hauls in August and September, Biden dramatically outraised the president as the general election heated up -- and he outspent Trump on TV ads the past three months. In the digital ad wars, Biden also enjoyed a slight spending advantage. Biden held his own in both presidential debates – disproving the repeated attacks by Trump and his campaign questioning the 77-year old nominee""s mental acuity. And, Trump""s brief hospitalization after contracting COVID-19, as well an autumn surge in the coronavirus in key states across the country, kept the campaign""s spotlight firmly on an issue that did no favors for the president""s reelection chances. The final stretch of the campaign saw Biden playing offense and the president on defense – with most of the campaign stops in states Trump narrowly captured in 2016. Biden""s closing themes were the same as those he used when he announced his candidacy. ""The heart and soul of this country""s at stake,"" Biden told Florida voters during a stop in Broward County last week as he promised to bring compassion and empathy back to the White House. And, Biden continued to emphasize his goal to unite the nation, repeatedly stressing that ""I""m running as a proud Democrat but I""ll govern as an American president to unite and to heal. I""ll work as hard for those who didn""t support me as those who do. That""s the job of the president: a duty of caring, caring for everyone."" Taking aim at the president""s war of words with many of the nation""s leading public health officials, Biden highlighted that ""we choose hope over fear, we choose unity over division, and we choose science over fiction, and yes, we choose truth over lies."" Biden now has two and a half months to assemble a cabinet and top officials who instantly will have to cope with the biggest challenges ever faced by an incoming president and administration – from the worst pandemic to strike the world in a century, and the worst economic recession to grip the nation since The Great Depression eight decades ago. Biden will be squeezed from both sides – by reeling Republicans who may look to run the same playbook that stymied President Obama and Biden as they took over in the White House in 2009. But, he""ll also face pressure from his left flank. The left will be looking for top progressives to land leading roles in Biden""s administration, and will be pushing hard to implement their agenda on the economy, social justice, civil rights and judicial reform, and on combating climate change. Firebrand lawmakers on the left – such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York – kept the peace during the general election, but with the Democrats"" common foe now defeated – infighting may soon commence, with the left scrutinizing every move by a politician firmly planted in the center-left of the party. Also hovering over Biden: questions over his durability and whether he""ll run for re-election in four years. The last thing the president-elect needs at the onset of his tenure in the White House is to be collared with lame-duck status. Biden hasn""t ruled out seeking a second term. Asked in August if he was open to running for re-election, he said ""absolutely,"" in an interview with ABC News."
fox_news|"Reaction from Black Voices for Trump member Paris Dennard and Democratic strategist Mustafa Tameez. Coronavirus infected the election. The virus is the top issue to voters, over half of them disapprove of how President Trump""s handling it, and they increasingly trust Joe Biden to do a better job on it.  That keeps Biden ahead in the presidential race, according to a Fox News survey of registered voters. Biden leads by 8 points over Trump, 49-41 percent. That advantage is outside the margin of error. However, neither candidate receives 50 percent support and 10 percent are undecided/back someone else -- and the race has narrowed since June, when the former vice president was up by 12 points (50-38 percent). There""s a large gender gap, as Trump is ahead by 5 points among men, while Biden is up 19 among women. Biden also leads among Blacks (+64), Hispanics (+30), millennials (+22), suburban voters (+11) and independents (+11). Seven percent of those approving of Trump""s job performance back Biden. CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS Whites with a college degree (+3) and without a degree go for Trump (+9). He""s also the choice among White evangelical Christians (+43), rural voters (+9) and seniors (+1). Last month, seniors went for Biden by 10. Biden is preferred over Trump among extremely motivated voters (+8 points), those extremely likely to vote (+9) and those who feel it is extremely important their candidate wins (+13). However, the number of Biden supporters who are extremely likely to vote drops 25 points if the virus is hitting so hard in November as to, for instance, close restaurants. Because the drop-off would just be 16 points among Trump supporters, that puts Biden""s lead at just 3 points over the president in that still-raging coronavirus scenario. The virus is a campaign issue -- but it could also be a factor, like bad weather, that reduces turnout. Meanwhile, in contrast to 2016 when voters viewed both candidates as unlikable, Biden garners a net +11 favorable rating: 54 percent view him favorably vs. 43 percent unfavorably. For Trump, it""s 43 percent favorable vs. 56 percent unfavorable. That gives him a net -13 points. Indeed, nearly half, 47 percent, have a ""strongly"" unfavorable opinion compared to 31 percent for Biden. Voters believe Trump lacks the key traits for the Oval Office: less than half think he has the mental soundness (43 percent), intelligence (42 percent), and judgment (40 percent) to serve effectively as president. For reference, 36 percent felt he had the necessary judgment in October 2016, less than a month before his election victory. Biden bests Trump on each measure: 47 percent are confident in his mental soundness, 51 percent believe he has the intelligence and 52 percent say he has the judgment. Notably, 50 percent eludes both candidates on mental soundness. Those ages 65+ think Trump has it by a 1-point margin and that Biden lacks it by 3 points. The biggest trait difference is on compassion: 56 percent believe Biden has it compared to 36 percent for Trump. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP All that helps explain why more trust Biden to do a better job than Trump on race relations (+21) and coronavirus (+17 points).  Last month, more trusted Biden on the virus by 9 points.  The two are trusted about equally on the economy (Biden +1).  It was a 3-point Trump edge in May. Twenty-nine percent rank coronavirus the No. 1 problem facing the country. That tops the 15 percent who cite the economy and 10 percent who say race relations. Eighty-six percent are concerned about coronavirus spreading, and the number saying the virus is ""not at all"" under control jumped 18 points since last month, from 33 percent to 51 percent. The president""s ratings are underwater by 13 points on the pandemic (43 percent approve, 56 percent disapprove) and by 21 points on race relations (35-56 percent). His ratings on the economy split 47-47. That""s down from a high 56 percent approval in January and is only the fourth time he hasn""t received positive marks on the issue. Currently, just 26 percent say they are better off than four years ago and most, 69 percent, rate the economy negatively. Trump""s overall job rating is upside-down by 9 points:  45 percent approve and 54 percent disapprove. Last month, it was 44-55 percent. His best ratings, 49-49 percent, came in April. Voters favor a more aggressive response to the virus than the president. Majorities favor a national stay-in-place order for everyone except essential workers (59 percent) and a national mask-wearing order for indoor spaces (71 percent). Sixty-three percent favor letting Americans vote by mail during the pandemic. Democrats (82 percent) and independents (60 percent) like the idea, while Republicans split (43 favor, 47 oppose). Two-thirds want children to attend public schools this fall in person, to some extent. That includes 15 percent who think their public schools should fully reopen as usual, 21 percent who prefer opening with social distancing and masks, and 31 percent who want a mix of in-person and remote. Twenty-five percent would prefer schools be fully remote. Parents and nonparents hold similar views, but moms and dads with kids at home see things differently. Dads are more likely than moms to favor some kind of reopening (80 vs. 54 percent). Moms are more inclined than dads to support being fully remote (37 vs. 15 percent). There""s also a partisan gap. More Republicans (84 percent) than Democrats (55 percent) say schools should reopen to some extent, while nearly four times as many Democrats (38 percent) as Republicans (10 percent) prefer fully remote. By a 62-32 percent margin, voters favor continuing the extra $600/week unemployment benefit Congress passed in response to the pandemic. Most Democrats (78 percent) and a large minority of Republicans (46 percent) favor extending it. More than twice as many voters think candidates should only hold virtual events right now (62 percent) as say it is okay to campaign in front of crowds (28 percent). Pollpourri The number predicting Trump will be reelected has dropped 11 points since February. At that time, 56 percent thought he would win. Now, 45 percent think so. The decline in reelection expectations comes from both Democrats (-13 points) and Republicans (-9). Overall, 61 percent are satisfied with their candidate choices, but 33 percent think the ballot should include a ""none of the above"" option. More Trump supporters (73 percent) than Biden supporters (62 percent) are happy with their choices. The largest portion of those backing both Biden (49 percent) and Trump (47 percent) say there is ""no chance at all"" they will change their vote. However, more of those supporting Trump (15 percent) than Biden (9 percent) say there is a ""strong"" chance they could change their mind. Far more approve of the job infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci (74 percent) is doing on coronavirus than Trump""s performance (43 percent). Moreover, 44 percent ""strongly"" approve of Fauci, up from 37 percent in June. Trump first wore a mask in public July 11.  Eighty-one percent of voters report wearing a mask all or most of the time when in public, up from 72 percent in May.  Ninety percent of Democrats and 71 percent of Republicans wear a mask.  Six percent of Republicans never wear one, down from 14 percent in May. Among Democrats, 1 percent say never, down from 3 percent. Generally, 80 percent have a favorable opinion of people who wear masks (June 13-16, 2020). Conducted July 12-15, 2020, under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,104 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for all registered voters. Fox News"" Victoria Balara contributed to this report."
msnbc|"In his Wednesday evening address to a joint session of Congress, President Joe Biden made perhaps the most pro-transgender comment in the history of presidential addresses. ""To all the transgender Americans watching at home — especially the young people who are so brave — I want you to know that your president has your back,"" he said. He""s not the first president to mention the word ""transgender"" in an address to Congress — that honor goes to Barack Obama — and Biden""s words were meant to carry significant weight for an American trans community under legislative siege at the state level. But trans people need more than just words right now. So far this year, eight anti-LGBTQ bills have been enacted into law, and over 250 anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced in at least 30 states, according to the Human Rights Campaign. These attacks on trans people are primarily focused on kids and adolescents. Arkansas enacted a bill earlier this month that banned transition-related care — like puberty blockers or hormone replacement therapy — for trans adolescents. Eight states, including Arkansas, have passed bans on trans girls playing girls interscholastic sports. A bill currently being discussed in Texas would classify affirming trans children as child abuse, and parents of trans kids could risk losing custody of their kids or even face jail time under the bill. It""s LGBTQ criminalization to a level not seen in this country for decades, and the bills threaten to further marginalize or outright drive trans people out of swaths of states across the conservative South. Marginalized groups of people have, of course, been forced to move to avoid state-sponsored persecution before, but such a thing hasn""t happened in the U.S. in a very long time. The White House has done some early and important work on trans rights during its first 100 days. Most recently, the Department of Justice got involved in the case of trans prisoner Ashley Diamond, who said she has experienced horrific sexual assault and mistreatment in a men""s prison facility in Georgia. Biden also signed an executive order expanding throughout federal government policy the Supreme Court""s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which held that discrimination based on gender identity constitutes sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The president has long been a supporter of trans rights. He called it the ""civil rights issue of our time"" in 2012. But the most immediate political threat to trans lives is conservative state legislation targeting trans kids. Kai Shappley, a 10-year-old trans girl who caught the nation""s attention with her moving testimony against anti-trans legislation in Texas, thanked the president for his words Wednesday but went on to ask a very sobering question: What will the president do to keep Kai's mom out of jail for supporting her daughter? There are direct actions the White House could take to fight back against the new state-level bills, which the president opposes. In a March 5 press conference, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the president""s position is that these laws are illegal. Biden could deploy the DOJ""s Civil Rights Division to legally fight back against any new anti-trans legislation. That""s the long game. In the short term, the president could help provide resources for relocating any trans families to trans-friendlier states. But most importantly would be passing the Equality Act, which would undermine all of the state laws in one fell swoop. Biden had made a campaign promise to sign the Equality Act within the first 100 days of his administration, a deadline that has now come and gone. The president renewed his call for the Senate to pass the landmark equality legislation in Wednesday night""s speech. Though it passed the House 64 days ago, it has stalled in the Senate. A hearing on the bill was held by the Senate Judiciary Committee in March, but it hasn""t gone any further since then. It""s unclear that Democrats have the required 60 votes to overcome an inevitable conservative filibuster, nor is it obvious that the White House even has 50 votes in the chamber for the bill. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., the quintessential Senate swing vote in this Congress, said in 2017 that he did not support some of the trans provisions in the Equality Act, and nothing since then indicates his position has changed. It""s likely the Senate would need to kill the filibuster to pass the bill. But that remains unlikely as there aren""t enough votes to accomplish that at this time. Manchin recently told Vox he believes the filibuster is essential to the function of the Senate. In a lot of ways, Biden""s hands are tied on the Equality Act — and, by extension, trans rights — but he could lean the White House""s political force into passing the act and saving Kai Shappley""s mom from jail time. If Biden really had trans people""s backs, he""d back it up with actions, not words."
msnbc|"(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NARRATOR (voice-over): A global pandemic with no end in sight, and every government decision could mean life or death. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: If you do not do an adequate response, we will have the deleterious consequence of more infections and more deaths. NARRATOR: Tonight, former Vice President Joe Biden on exactly what he would do differently from President Trump. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Our family members and friends and neighbors are dying while Trump is having a temper tantrum. NARRATOR: But how does the apparent Democratic nominee get his message out in a time of isolation? BIDEN: I`m anxious to go out and campaign. NARRATOR: Tonight, Lawrence O`Donnell goes one-on-one with Joe Biden, and later both joined by Stacey Abrams, a leading voice for the Democrats. STACEY ABRAMS (D), FOUNDER, FAIR FIGHT: I`m working hard to lobby Congress to ensure that we have both by mail in every state. NARRATOR: Her cause, to push for fair and free elections, taking on new urgency in the age of coronavirus. BIDEN: We can both have democracy and elections and, at the same time, correct the public health. NARRATOR: All that, plus your questions. (END VIDEOTAPE) NARRATOR: This is a special edition of ""THE LAST WORD,"" Joe Biden, with Stacey Abrams. LAWRENCE O`DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: When Joe Biden announced his campaign for president just over a year ago, COVID-19 did not exist. But now the coronavirus pandemic threatens the lives of every man, woman and child in the United States. You have heard Joe Biden on all of the other issues that were raised in the several presidential campaign debates. Now it`s time to hear from Joe Biden about the issues that will dominate the rest of the presidential campaign, issues of life and death. If Joe Biden is sworn in as the next president on January 20th, your life and your children`s lives and your parents` lives and your grandparents` lives are going to depend on the work that Joe Biden starts doing that afternoon in the Oval Office, in the Cabinet Room, in the Situation Room. We`re going to ask Joe Biden to take us inside those rooms with him tonight and tell us exactly what he would do on the afternoon of Inauguration Day if he is elected president. And when I say we, I mean you will be joining in the questioning, because we will turn this hour into a town hall of sorts, with questions from you, our viewers, for Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams, when she joins us later in this hour. Stacey Abrams is the head of an organization called Fair Fight, which is devoted to making sure that all voters will be able to cast their votes for president on November 3rd, without any interference with their voting rights. And Stacey Abrams now has the new mission of making sure that you can cast your vote safely in the age of coronavirus, by mail, if necessary. Stacey Abrams will join us later in this hour. We begin tonight with the numbers. As of tonight, there are now 1,422,824 confirmed cases of coronavirus. And, as of tonight, this country has suffered at least 86,179 confirmed deaths from coronavirus. And there is a third number that would be the only number we talk about tonight if it were simply the result of changing economic conditions, instead of it being the result of a deadly pandemic sweeping the world. And that third number is the largest number of people filing for unemployment benefits in the history of the unemployment program, with an additional three million people reported filing today, bringing the total to 36.5 million people claiming unemployment benefits. The unemployment rate is now 14.7 percent and going up from there. That is the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression of the 1930s. And when Democrat Franklin Roosevelt beat an incumbent Republican president in the 1932 election, President Roosevelt was sworn in, in 1933 facing a 25 percent unemployment rate. But he was not also facing a deadly virus that was killing more than 100,000 people, as the coronavirus will surely do before the next presidential inauguration. Joining us now is former Vice President Joe Biden, Democratic candidate for president. Thank you very much for joining us tonight, Mr. Vice President. We really appreciate you being here. We`re going to go straight to this issue of... BIDEN: Lawrence, thanks for having me. O`DONNELL: Thank you. Of -- I want to go right into day one of your presidency. And let`s assume the conditions we have today, because Dr. Fauci, Anthony Fauci, guarantees us -- he has used the word guarantee -- for a second wave. That second wave would surely be breaking in January, combined with the regular flu season. You can imagine 1,700 people dying a day, as there -- as is happening now. We can imagine hundreds of thousands more infections happening throughout the country. And -- and, at the very same time, you have this astronomical, Depression- level unemployment rate. So, your inauguration will be quick. It will not have a parade, if the conditions are the same as today. It will probably take place indoors, maybe in the Rotunda of the Capitol. You will be able to get right back to the Oval Office by 1:00 p.m. You walk back into the West Wing of the White House. The secretary of labor is waiting with the frightening unemployment statistics. Secretary of Health and Human Services is there. Dr. Fauci will probably still be there or will have been rehired by you if he`s been fired. Where do you start? Who do you talk to first? What are the -- what`s the decision sequence? BIDEN: Well, first of all, it`s going to depend on how much worse this president makes it between now and January the 20th of 2021. The fact is that it can get even worse than it is now. He has delayed, delayed, delayed from the very beginning his willingness to go out and deal with this crisis. He`s ignored it. He said it was going to go away, it was going to be a miracle. He wasted an awful lot of time. And I think, as a consequence, an awful lot of lives were lost in the meantime. Coronavirus is not -- he didn`t cause the coronavirus, but he has not reacted well. But one thing you`re going to have to do is, you`re going to have to have, by that time, between the time of being elected and the time of being sworn in, have put together a team of people that are going to deal with this in a way that hadn`t been dealt with up to that point, at least probably will not have been dealt with. One, tell the American people the truth. Look at the science. Put together a board, a pandemic board, like we did in World War II, when President Roosevelt put together a board that related to dealing with how we`re going to deal with World War II. This is a requirement that we have the best people in the world sitting there advising me and the country as to what has to be done. In the meantime, it`s going to matter, Lawrence, whether or not between now and then this president has used his powers and used the organizational ability that the White House has, that the president has to make sure we have enough PPP (sic), those protective gear for this second wave, if there is going to be the second wave, which is predictable, and to make sure we are going to have in place all the tests that we need, all the tests we need, and we are able to track and test, test and follow on when there is an outbreak, where it was, track and trace. All that requires equipment and requires planning and requires time. If that`s been done, the task will be at least easier, it will cost fewer lives. If it has not been done, it will be an absolute, incredible disaster, beyond repair. O`DONNELL: Mr. Vice President, the -- one of the issues you have to deal with in this pandemic, obviously, it`s worldwide, so it`s international relations. China, where this -- this virus began, is still going to be a major factor for you to contend with starting on your first day in the White House. Let`s listen just for a moment about how Donald Trump has dealt with, described his view of China over the course of this pandemic. Let`s just listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: President Xi loves the people of China. He loves his country. And he`s doing a very good job with a very, very tough situation. He is very capable. The country is very capable. It could have been stopped right where it came from, China. And I started calling it the Chinese virus. Could have been stopped in China before it started, and it wasn`t. Ask China that question, OK? (END VIDEO CLIP) O`DONNELL: So, the president goes from saying China is doing a great job to, it`s all China`s fault. How are you going to deal with China? We have -- you have to have some level of cooperation with them in terms of research, in terms of medical supplies, many of which originate in China. But it clearly a difficult relationship to manage, especially with the coronavirus. BIDEN: Well, first of all, the president got it wrong from the beginning, absolutely missed any opportunity to get ahead of this. You know, back in January, I think it was the 27th, when he was saying this, praising China and talking about it not being a problem. We had put together in our administration an office within the White House to deal with future pandemics. They had been briefed on it, they meaning the incoming administration. We had over 44, if I`m not mistaken, people from the CDC in China, in China to observe what was going on. The president brought home the vast majority of them, I think left only four in place. I kept -- I wrote an article back in, I think, the 27th of January saying, we -- there`s -- a pandemic is coming. We should insist on being in China to see for ourselves what was happening, so we could be prepared. The president said, no, no, they`re doing a great job. This -- all this is going -- everything is fine. The fact is that he has not been responsible at all from the very beginning. We lost at least three months of opportunity to get ahead of this, or at least to catch up with it, to catch up with the problem. And so the thing that I`d be doing is resetting that pandemic office in place, number one, making sure we had the CDC, like we did in our administration, forward-based around the world, so we could see these things coming, because there will be more coming. You know, the truth is, Trump was praising the Chinese government and downplaying the threat to the American people, and, as I said, as I was warning -- I was warning the need to get the people into China to see what was actually going on. And the Chinese government`s word, we -- we squandered critical time. And so I just don`t -- and now he`s trying to play this China card. I mean, I don`t know what -- this is an unusual president. O`DONNELL: I want to go to the complexity that -- of what you will be facing on day one, with all those Cabinet members there, obviously the secretary of state. If their nominations are pending, they will still be there. The secretary of state will be concerned with not only the relations with China and all of this, but how a vaccine, once it`s developed, can be distributed throughout the world, because we know, if we don`t crush it throughout the world, it will come back to us. I just wanted... BIDEN: You got it. O`DONNELL: ... you to listen to, for one second, Mr. Vice President, Laurie Garrett, who is an MSNBC contributor now. She`s a Pulitzer Prize winner, has been writing about infectious diseases for many years. She was on this program the other night describing the complexities of the administration of a vaccine, once that vaccine is eventually developed. Let`s listen to the way she described those international complexities. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LAURIE GARRETT, SENIOR FELLOW FOR GLOBAL HEALTH, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS: It requires creating a profit motive scheme of some sort that will -- that brings the industry to the table, without imagining the kind of profit returns they usually want from pharmaceuticals. And that means coming up with agreements with the World Trade Organization and with the trade-related intellectual property agreements, and all sorts of instruments of international law. (END VIDEO CLIP) O`DONNELL: Mr. Vice President, you`re familiar with all those instruments she`s talking about. Most of us are not. The vaccine, if developed, will happen, at the earliest, on the watch of -- in the next presidential term, what would be your first presidential term. Getting that vaccine out in the United States and helping it get distributed to the world would be your job. How would you approach it? BIDEN: Well, look, I`d approach it like we did in our administration when we dealt with Ebola, and we dealt with these other -- we organized the rest of the world. We got the rest of the world to come up with billions of dollars to deal with the problem. We didn`t -- there wasn`t a vaccine at the time. And now guess what has happened? There has been a -- there was an international meeting of all those countries that are trying to work out and find an answer to a vaccine. Everyone showed up except us. The United States was not there, not there. And we, in fact, the president said, we`re the best, we don`t -- basically, we don`t need anybody else`s help. We`re going to have to be in a position to be one of the leaders in the world to figure out how we can make sure that this vaccine is made available first and foremost in our case to the people of the United States of America getting access to it, rural, all people, all people. That is going to be a very difficult thing to figure out how to get it out and around the country. But, in addition to that, there are a lot of nations out there that have no capacity to pay for any of this, and notwithstanding the profit motive. So what we`re going to be in a position of having to do is get other governments to help fund, fund for the rest of the world these vaccines, made available in other parts of the world, because, as you said, Lawrence, we may square it away here. But what happens if there is no vaccine in Central and Latin America? What happens is there is no vaccine in other parts of the world? As we have learned by now, you can`t build a wall high enough to keep out a virus. And so we should be leading the world. And we are once again absent. We`re not even in the discussion. We`re not even in the discussion. What`s going on in London right now, they`re -- in Cambridge, they`re on the verge, they think, of moving forward. If we don`t participate at all, what makes us think we`re going to be in on the deal? We must organize the world to deal with this, so everyone has access. And it`s going to cost all of us. It`s a little -- if I can make an analogy, it`s a little bit like, you know, we have the Amazon burning. And what is happening is, it`s the greatest carbon sink in the world. It absorbs more carbon into the Earth than we emit in a day, every single day and it`s burning. What are we doing? The president is sitting around doing nothing. We should be organizing the world saying, we`re going to raise $20 billion, and we`re going to go to the president of Brazil and say, here`s the deal. We`re going to make sure that you don`t have to burn the Amazon to make a living in your country. This is what we`re going to do. But guess what`s happening? Nothing. We`re doing nothing. The same way things are going to have to happen when you`re going to have all those Europe -- Eastern European countries, those African countries that don`t have the capacity to pay for it. The world is -- in their overwhelming interest of the rest of the world and the major nations of the world, the major economic powers to provide this capacity and has to be organized, organized. O`DONNELL: I want to open it up to our town hall component and get a question from a voter. This first question, Mr. Vice President is from a voter in California. Let listen to this. BIDEN: OK. QUESTION: Hi, Vice President Biden. My name is Namid (ph). I am from San Mateo, California, and thank you for allowing me to participate in this town hall with you. BIDEN: Thank you. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: I`m thinking about that quote from theologian (ph) Kierkegaard that you always recite. Faith sees best in the dark. I find it so profound what is going on in America today, with so many families across this country going through tough times. As someone who has lost a wife and a daughter and a son and knows what it`s like to go through loss, what advice would you give to a family who has lost someone to COVID- 19? Thank you. BIDEN: Well, first of all, you know, the folks who have recently lost someone to COVID-19 over 86 -- almost 87,000 of them now, they feel like there`s a black hole in the middle of their chest, they are being sucked into it and frightened and scared and don`t know what to do. All I can tell them is that it will take time. But in time, what`s going to happen is you`re going to find when you think of that son, daughter, husband, wife, mother, father you lost, you`re going to get a smile on your lip before you get a tear in your eye, and that`s when you know you`re going to make it. And the way you make it, at least in my experience, is so many people have gone through so much more than I have, losing a wife, and a daughter and then a son to cancer is that you have to -- you have to have a purpose. You have to have purpose. Purpose will drive you to be able to get -- to control your life. And the purpose will be many of these people, what do we do to make life better, better for other people? How could we have avoided what happened here? What are the things you want to do? Are we going to do things like making sure those first responders that lost their lives and those are the remainder who are getting paid essentially minimum wage, get a fair deal? They`re carrying us on their back. They`re carrying the country on their back right now, and they`re not being treated with dignity and respect. I think the way they`ll find -- but right now, that`s no solace to anybody that recently lost somebody. It`s of no solace. But what I have to say is they`re still with you. They`re in your heart, part of your soul, it`s who you are. And you`ve got to have faith the time will come, the time will come when you`ll get through this veil of darkness. You really will. But the best way to get through it is with a sense of purpose and realizing he or she is with you. They`re in you. They`re part of you. They never go away, and they`ll advice you and they`ll be there with you. And you`ve got to move. You just got to get up. As my dad would say, you know, when you get knocked down, you just got to get up, just get up. And think of yourself, what would they want you to do? Would they want you to do? They`d want you to get up. They`d want you to be safe. They want you to move on. That`s all I can really say, quite frankly. It`s of no solace to anybody who`s recently lost someone, and this is all been recent. O`DONNELL: Mr. Vice President, before we go to a break, before we bring in Stacey Abrams, I want to ask you about the Tara Reade story. And you served in the Senate for about 36 years. Senator from Delaware, you were chairman of committees. Having worked in the Senate myself, I`m just in my head doing the numbers. You have to have had well over 1,000 Senate staffers between the committee staff, the Delaware Senate staff. Do you remember Tara Reade who worked there for about a year in 1992, `93? BIDEN: To be honest with you, I don`t. Look, let me get something clear. When a woman makes a claim that she has been harassed or abused, and this claim has changed, has gone up, but harassed or abused, she should be taken seriously. She should come forward, share her story, she should be taken seriously, and should be thoroughly vetted. And in every case, what matters is the truth. Truth is what matters. And the truth of the case is nothing like this ever, ever happened. She has a right to be heard but then should be vetted, and the truth ultimately matters. And I give you my word, it never ever happened. O`DONNELL: Let me ask you about a piece, it was an op-ed piece in ""The New York Times"" recently by Linda Hirshman and it was entitled ""I believe Tara Reade, I`m voting for Joe Biden anyway."" And this is an accusation that she says there were no witnesses to this, it happened in a semi- or in a public place the way she describes it in the basement of the Senate. That might sound like a private place but as you and I both know, that`s a thoroughfare, that`s a very busy area. But there are no witnesses to it, so it`s your word saying it didn`t happen and now her version of it that it did happen. What do you say to women who were ready to vote for Joe Biden, eager to vote for Joe Biden but this gives them serious pause because they do believe Tara Reade, and you`re not going to change their mind about that? What would you say to them about their vote? BIDEN: Well, I think they should vote their heart. If they believe Tara Reade, they probably shouldn`t vote for me. I wouldn`t vote for me if I believe Tara Reade. The fact is that -- look at Tara Reade`s story. It changes considerably. And so, but I don`t want to question her motive. I don`t want to question anything other than to say the truth matters. This is being vetted. It`s been vetted. They went and people interviewed scores of my employees over my whole career. This is just totally, thoroughly, completely out of character, and the idea that in a public place in a hallway, I would assault a woman? I mean, it`s -- I mean -- anyway, I promise you, it never happened. It should be vetted. She should be thoroughly looked at and whether or not these happened, look at the story, follow the story line and determine whether there`s any truth to it. And there is no truth to it. I promise you. O`DONNELL: I want to go back to where we began, which is this possibility of a Biden inauguration day in January, which would be in the middle of the second wave. It could be a very dark time. And when we think of inaugural addresses, of course, the one many people remember vividly word for word, John Fitzgerald Kennedy saying, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country. It seems like if you`re delivering the next inaugural address, that formulation is going to be reversed because everyone in this country is going to be looking at you and saying, what can you do for me? I am out of work, I need a job. I have lost my mother. I`ve lost my brother. I am suffering. That is going to be it seems to me a moment where a president is going to have to say what that president can do for them. What will you say? BIDEN: I will say, I guarantee you, number one, I will tell you the truth. The American people is a -- to paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt -- the American people are strong. They`re tough. They know -- they want to know the truth. They can handle the truth. What they can`t handle is lie or lies. I will be level with them straight up. I`ll tell them what the science is as best we know it. I`ll lay out to them how in fact we can -- once we get by re-stimulating the economy and getting people back moving so they`re able to keep their homes and keep their apartments and being able to have the food available on their tables that they need. That in the meantime, while we have unemployment, if the unemployment rate is as high as it is now or higher like it was with Roosevelt, I will tell them the government -- the government has an obligation to see to it that you are held harmless in terms of being able to -- where you live, being able to pay for your medical bills, being able to do whatever you need to do to take care of your family. And then I will tell them what I`m going to do when I bend this curve and break it so that we`re in a position that we`re going to rebuild the country. We`re going to rebuild this country better than it was found. That`s no solace to someone who lost a family member, but we`re going to rebuild it better than we found it. Look, Lawrence, I talked a lot. I`ve been on your program before talking about -- even before I announced I was going to run, restoring the soul of America. We`re seeing the soul of America now. Average Americans doing extraordinary things, risking -- in some cases, giving their lives -- to carry the rest of us on their back, whether they`re grocery store clerks or truck drivers or whether they are people working as nurses or people working as child aides, whatever. We have to right the wrongs that are being exposed that exist now. All those people are doing that are the people that most -- most people did not spend a lot of time. Did not spend a lot of time thinking about, and now they`ve seen how courageous they have been, what they have done. It`s time to make it right. And we can begin to do that by providing a recovery that in fact, will create millions of new jobs, making sure that we`re building a new infrastructure, putting people to work in ways that deal with the institutional racism and institutional barriers that have existed. And I`ll explain what those are and how we`re going to get to it. O`DONNELL: All right. We`re going to take a break here. Mr. Vice President, just please stay with us. When we return -- BIDEN: Sure. O`DONNELL: -- we`re going to be joined in our discussion by Stacey Abrams. Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams on television together for the first time. That`s next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) O`DONNELL: In her last campaign in 2018, Stacey Abrams came with 1.5 percent of winning the race for governor in Georgia. The Abrams taught Democrats two things. One, Georgia can be a competitive state if they can get out the vote. And two, Republicans will do everything they can to prevent Democrats from getting their voters to the polls. Stacey Abrams has used that experience to form the mission statement of Fair Fight, an organization devoted to making sure that all voters will be able to cast their votes for president on November 3rd without any interference with their voting rights. Former Vice President Joe Biden is back with us and joining our discussion now from Atlanta is Stacey Abrams, the founder of Fair Fight, an organization fighting for fair and free elections with voter protection teams in 18 battleground states. Stacey Abrams, thank you very much for joining us tonight, and pardon me for a minute because I want to begin this with a question to Joe Biden -- because Stacey Abrams is here because Joe Biden invited Stacey Abrams to be here. And so, Mr. Vice President, do you have an announcement to make? Is this an audition? Is there -- what is the reason that you decided it`s time for me to get on TV with Stacey Abrams? BIDEN: Well, because Stacey Abrams has done more to deal with the fair vote and making sure there is a fair vote than anybody and she -- I mean, she has a great, great capacity to explain things and to lay out exactly why it`s going to be so critically important in this election. This president already said when they put in the stimulus package the Congress first passed money to provide for mail-in ballots, he already said, I`m not for that, if we do that, no Republican will ever win, or something to that effect. He`s made it clear -- this is a guy who said he wants to defund the Post Office from being able to deliver ballots. I mean -- so Stacey knows what she`s doing and she`s an incredibly capable person. O`DONNELL: All right. Let`s actually listen to what Donald Trump said about mail-in ballots. We have that here. And full disclosure before you listen to what Donald Trump says about this, the one thing I have in common with Donald Trump is that we both vote by mail. Now let`s listen to this. (LAUGHTER) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: So, the problem with the mail-in ballots, it`s subject to tremendous corruption, tremendous corruption, cheating. And so I`m against it. (END VIDEO CLIP) O`DONNELL: Stacey Abrams, he`s against it. A lot of Republicans are against whatever it is you`re trying to do, whatever your next idea is that you think will help get out the vote. And so, they used to be in favor of mail-in ballots. And now here we are. ABRAMS: Well, I first want to say, thank you for having me. And thank you to Vice President Biden for including me in on this conversation. Whether you`re thinking about what happened in Georgia in 2018, when thousands of Georgians were denied the right to be heard, or what we saw happen in Wisconsin, where 52 people, at last count, contracted COVID because they were forced to cast their ballot in person, we know that vote by mail is the safest and most accessible way of making sure that every American can be heard on November 3. The reality is that it`s safe, that there is no fraud of any consequence. In fact, in every single state that has used vote by mail regularly, Oregon for the last 20 years, the number of people who have committed fraud is negotiable. But what is more telling is that they don`t want the voices of people suffering from COVID-19, suffering from a collapsed economy, and suffering from the cowardice of Donald Trump, they don`t want their voices heard at the ballot. But what we can do through the HEROES package is ensure that everyone in America who wants to vote by mail can do so, but we can also create accessible spaces for people to vote in person early and in person on the day of, because, if you`re disabled, if you`re homeless, if you have been displaced by COVID, if you have language barriers, and if you`re Native American, we need you to be able to go into those polling places, but to make sure that there is enough space to meet the CDC guidelines. We have got to get as many people as possible to vote by mail. Every state can do it. We simply have to invest in it and put in the guardrails to make it possible for every American who is eligible to vote. O`DONNELL: The -- we`re concentrating on COVID-19 tonight, because no presidential campaign has ever experienced anything like this. It`s obviously going to be the most important thing that the president faces after the next inauguration. But the world does not stop for the president on all other issues of concern. And Stacey Abrams, in Georgia, for example, we saw the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery. And there is an example of where the tensions, the kind of racial tensions and value issues that actually got Joe Biden into this campaign, according to his campaign announcement, came to us in a graphic and very, very disturbing way. Are you concerned that, in the next presidency, with the president concentrated so much on the pandemic, that it will be very difficult to get presidential attention to issues like the kind of racial injustice that we have seen in that incident? ABRAMS: Not at all, not if we have a president of competence and courage like Joe Biden. Let`s remember that not only was moments of COVID-19 at the same time the United States did. If South Korea can hold the largest most invested election in the midst of COVID-19 on April 15th, we can get this done by November but only if we pass the Heroes Act and get it done now. O`DONNELL: Vice President Biden, before we go to the next break, there is a bipartisan bill developing in the House of Representatives that we discussed on this program that would allow -- authorized funding for hiring 100,000 contact tracers to go to work throughout the United States. This would be basically a jobs program desperately needed and obviously fulfilling a very critical tool in fighting the coronavirus desperately needed. Do you support that? BIDEN: I strongly support it. And a lot of those people are the people that worked the job corps, the people who have worked in Peace Corps and other public service jobs. We know -- we know that until there is a vaccine, the only fundamental way to change the dynamic is test and trace. Test and trace. And hiring these people will provide jobs, number one, but even more importantly, it will allow us to gain control of the spread of this virus. Tracing, tracing, contact tracing, that is critically important and I strongly support it. O`DONNELL: We`re going to squeeze in a final break here. Joe Biden, Stacey Abrams, please stay with us. We`re going to be right back right after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) O`DONNELL: And we`re back with more of your questions for Vice President Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams. Let go to the next question. QUESTION: My name is Jackie Okomo (ph) from Stockton, California. I have a question for Vice President Biden. As an immigrant working as a nurse, we have provided the care for all without prejudice during the COVID pandemic. How do you plan to change the immigration laws to accommodate specialized immigrants towards a fast-track immigration process, to accommodate such crisis? BIDEN: By the way, number one, on day one I`m sending, no matter what the state of this is, to the United States Congress a bill to provide for a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, number one, in the United States. Number two, every DACA student will be able to stay. You realize there are 40,000 DACA students out there who are providing the kind of help we`re talking about right now in hospitals, as nurses` aides, as fire -- I mean, across the board? They`re doing incredible things for us now. And the idea that we treat -- that the president has pitted us against one another based on our race, religion, national origin, we are a land of immigrants. That`s what`s made us who we are. That`s what makes us so resilient. That`s what makes us so special. And I promise you, it`s a gigantic objective of mine to see to it that we make a -- that we have an immigration system that`s consistent with our values and who we say we are, and it does not now. Donald Trump is absolutely violating every basic value we have. O`DONNELL: What about fast-tracking the immigration process for physicians, nurses, other medical personnel? BIDEN: Yes, yes, and yes. (CROSSTALK) O`DONNELL: Great. We need answers like that so we can get in more questions. Let`s go -- let`s go to another question from one of our voters. QUESTION: Hi. I`m Glenda from Ohio. As a Democrat, it`s just as important to win the Senate as it is to win the White House. I want to know why Stacey Abrams wasn`t willing to run for the Senate in order to help the party but is willing to accept the role of vice president. ABRAMS: I appreciate the question. I personally say that -- BIDEN: She`s capable of doing any or both. (LAUGHTER) ABRAMS: Well, I would say this. I think we have to remember there are two things happening in 2020. We`re not only running a presidential election, but we`re running the 2010 election as well. That means we have to think about not winning the White House and the Senate, but we`ve got to win down ballot races, especially winning state legislatures in order to avoid the debacle that happened when Republicans gerrymandered our maps beyond recognition. That`s why I`m not only fighting for a fair fight in our elections and fighting for a fair fight in our Census, making sure everyone is counted so the Republicans can`t weaponize the Census against our people. I didn`t run for the Senate because I don`t believe that every job is interchangeable, and I`m not in politics to stay in office. I`m here to do the work and the work I thought was most important is making sure that we had free and fair elections across this country. I did that through Fair Fight. That we had a census that will count every American and every person in America through fair count, but also to respond to how COVID is ravaging the South. I live in a community and in a state where we have some of the highest infection rates and where we have some of the lowest resilience because the resources we need, the infrastructure we need has been broken. My interest is in making certain that Vice President Joe Biden becomes President Biden because we need someone who believes not only in thinking the right thoughts but doing the work. And this is a man of courage and competence who helped lead us through a global crisis before, and he can do it again. My interest is no matter what, that I help make certain that Joe Biden is the next president of the United States, that we win every election up and down the ballot so that we can right-size our country and move our nation forward. O`DONNELL: Our next question is from Ohio -- BIDEN: And we`ll win back the Senate. O`DONNELL: -- from Edward in Ohio, and this is for Vice President Biden. QUESTION: Sir, if you were to win the election, would you be willing to commit to not pulling the president forward and giving Donald Trump a pardon under the pretense of healing the nation? In other words, are you willing to commit to the American ideal that no one is above the law? BIDEN: Absolutely yes. I commit. O`DONNELL: And this is helping us get in all the more questions, so that`s a commitment. Mr. Vice President, you`re saying that wherever the investigative trail might lead, whether that be an investigative trail pursued by the Justice Department against Trump officials, Trump associates, administration officials, whether those are congressional investigations, that`s hands off for you? You`re not going to say, let`s just let bygones be bygones? BIDEN: It`s hands off completely. Look, the attorney general is not the president`s lawyer. It`s the people`s lawyer. And you remember when you were there with Pat Moynihan. We never saw anything like the prostitution of that office like we see it today. It is not something the president is entitled to do, to direct either a prosecution and/or decide to drop a case. That is not the president`s role, responsibility, and it`s a dereliction of his duty, and a dereliction of the duty as a -- you know, you have what? Whether 2,000 was it or former attorneys general or people who worked in the office that said the present attorney general should resign. What`s going on is an absolute travesty, a travesty of justice. That will not happen, I guarantee you. O`DONNELL: The issue of people wanting the vice president -- wanting the attorney general to resign is over the Michael Flynn case where the attorney general is basically trying to drop the case as a federal judge questioning how that case is being dropped. Mr. Vice President, what was your involvement in the investigation of Michael Flynn and the FBI investigation of Michael Flynn? BIDEN: I was never a part or had any knowledge of any criminal investigation into Flynn while I was in office, period. Not one single time. O`DONNELL: Let`s get one more question in here. This is from a voter in California. QUESTION: Hi, Vice President Biden and Ms. Abrams. My name is Victor Xi (ph). I`m a 17-year-old, a senior at Stephenson High School in Illinois and just got elected to be a delegate to represent Vice President Joe Biden at the DNC convention in August on behalf of Illinois` 10th congressional district. Today, my question is for Stacey Abrams. Given that young people and high schoolers like myself don`t often turn out to vote in elections, how do you ensure that not only high schoolers and college students are empowered in the political process but also turn out to vote at higher rates? ABRAMS: Well, I`ve been working on this since I was 17. I started registering students to vote on my college campus before I was old enough to vote. I was sent as an international fellow to Austria to represent the United States on the conversation of youth civic engagement when I was 21. It`s because I believe in the voice of young people. I know that young people change the world, and not long ago I was one. But what I know more than that is that this cannot simply be an academic conversation. That`s why my campaign in 2018, we had young people at every level of our campaign. And in our work that we`re doing now, from the work we`re doing in southwest Georgia, helping to respond to COVID-19, to the work of counting folks in the census, we are engaging young people, especially college and high school age students. Your voices matter because this world is a world you will inherit, but it`s also a world you have to survive. That means that we have to focus on issues of climate change, criminal justice. We have to make sure that health care and economic justice are part of every single decision, and that happens by speaking directly to you. But more importantly, engaging you and setting the policies themselves. I know that Joe Biden believes in youth engagement because he ran for the Senate at the age of 29. And he knows that like I do that we can`t win this nation if we don`t have everyone pulling in the same direction, especially your generation. O`DONNELL: Vice President Biden, we have seen -- BIDEN: Your generation owns this election. O`DONNELL: We have seen a whistle-blower testify at the House of Representatives today, Dr. Rick Bright, saying that his cautions, his predictions about what were happening, what was coming in this coronavirus pandemic, were ignored, were suppressed in effect. We have reports indicating that the CDC has not been able to issue the warnings that they want to be able to issue. Donald Trump has repeatedly said the sentence this week, I disagree with Anthony Fauci. In your administration, will the scientists, will the medical professionals be allowed to speak freely? Will you allow them all to testify to Congress whenever Congress requests them? Will you allow them to speak to the media? BIDEN: Absolutely -- absolutely, positively. Yes, yes, yes again. Really and truly. It is all about the science. This president is absolutely -- well, I shouldn`t say it. He does not -- he does whatever is in his interest, takes no responsibility, does whatever in his interest, and we have the problem we have right now. And -- and I hope if I`m president that Dr. Fauci will stay on in the administration. O`DONNELL: And that will be tonight`s last word. Joe Biden gets the last word. Stacey Abrams, thank you very much for joining us. Vice President Joe Biden, thank you for joining us. This has been a special LAST WORD. ""THE 11TH HOUR"" with Brian Williams will be up next. BRIAN WILLIAMS, MSNBC HOST: Well, good evening once again. Day 1211 of this Trump administration, 173 days until our next presidential election. The President wondered aloud in his public remarks today about whether or not coronavirus testing is over rated. He said it could be overrated. END"
msnbc|"As President Franklin D. Roosevelt put it when he coined the term ""the first 100 days"" during one of his early fireside chats, ""I think that we all wanted the opportunity of a little quiet thought to examine and assimilate in a mental picture the crowding events of the hundred days which had been devoted to the starting of the wheels of the New Deal."" The important takeaway was that Roosevelt gave himself and the American people milestones to assess not only the intent of the new administration, but also the measure of its success. The responsibility of those we elect to lead, whether during a depression or a pandemic coupled with tectonic social unrest, is to be an honest broker on our behalf. They must be fearless in enacting policies that encourage greater economic growth and social reforms; and visionary in fostering a climate that promotes job creation while remaining responsive to the welfare of those all too often left behind as growth takes hold. Leadership matters. Much of what has been written and said about President Joseph R. Biden overlooks this essential quality to his success. His time as both a senator and vice president positioned him well to understand that passing a big agenda — be it social or economic — requires the discipline of leadership. His immediate predecessor failed to pass much of anything — perhaps because he lacked both discipline and leadership. People are acutely aware of what is happening right now across the country. From Covid-19 recovery to racial inequality and policing, Americans are closely monitoring how well Biden is managing these rather difficult and highly charged issues. As he has crafted his policy on the pandemic and now infrastructure, Biden has shrewdly sat down with us at the proverbial kitchen table to explain what he wants to do and why. Even more importantly, he has asked us to help by doing our part. Biden""s approach is quite different from what we have seen from other presidents in recent years. He seems less concerned with the obvious Democrat vs. Republican rancor. Perhaps, it is because he is familiar with the ways of Washington and knows the political divides that block progress are mostly designed for partisan showboating. It should surprise no one that he has so far steered around such resistance and engaged more directly and personally with voters. And it""s working. Not only does a recent Pew Research Center poll have his job approval at 59 percent, but also the latest NBC News poll has 69 percent of Americans approving of the president""s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and 52 percent approving of how he""s managing the economy. And even though his approval is upside down with voters on China (35 percent), the gun issue (34 percent) and border security/immigration (33 percent), the American public does not seem generally to be holding those issues against him. The difference is leadership; and people are warming to Biden""s brand. As one NBC News poll respondent noted, ""The best thing about Joe Biden is I don't have to think about Joe Biden."" In other words, they trust him. It is against this overall narrative that Republicans find themselves struggling to make their political hits against Biden stick. Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., notes, ""I don't think we've done a very good job because he's getting away with defining himself and rolling out this stuff that we're borrowing every penny for it, and the public is buying it. We've got to find ways to articulate and scuffle in a better way, and I don't know that we've found that."" Republicans and even some progressives may want to see Biden""s first 100 days through a strictly partisan/ideological lens in which the administration is spending too much and getting it all wrong. But voters, at least for now, think the president is getting it right — or at least making it better. The American people want safety and they want normalcy. Parents want their kids back in school; small-business owners want to welcome back their customers; and everyone wants hugs and handshakes to replace sanitizers and masks. Biden thinks he can make that happen, and folks so far believe him. The president has demonstrated his concern and his compassion for everyday people. He is helping them look forward, not backward. He is raising their spirits rather than stoking their fears. He accepts the bottom line of leadership — the buck stops here — rather than blaming others. For countless Americans, that""s enough for them to ""examine and assimilate in a mental picture"" what leadership looks like. And so far, they like what they see."
msnbc|"In his Wednesday evening address to a joint session of Congress, President Joe Biden made perhaps the most pro-transgender comment in the history of presidential addresses. ""To all the transgender Americans watching at home — especially the young people who are so brave — I want you to know that your president has your back,"" he said. He""s not the first president to mention the word ""transgender"" in an address to Congress — that honor goes to Barack Obama — and Biden""s words were meant to carry significant weight for an American trans community under legislative siege at the state level. But trans people need more than just words right now. So far this year, eight anti-LGBTQ bills have been enacted into law, and over 250 anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced in at least 30 states, according to the Human Rights Campaign. These attacks on trans people are primarily focused on kids and adolescents. Arkansas enacted a bill earlier this month that banned transition-related care — like puberty blockers or hormone replacement therapy — for trans adolescents. Eight states, including Arkansas, have passed bans on trans girls playing girls interscholastic sports. A bill currently being discussed in Texas would classify affirming trans children as child abuse, and parents of trans kids could risk losing custody of their kids or even face jail time under the bill. It""s LGBTQ criminalization to a level not seen in this country for decades, and the bills threaten to further marginalize or outright drive trans people out of swaths of states across the conservative South. Marginalized groups of people have, of course, been forced to move to avoid state-sponsored persecution before, but such a thing hasn""t happened in the U.S. in a very long time. The White House has done some early and important work on trans rights during its first 100 days. Most recently, the Department of Justice got involved in the case of trans prisoner Ashley Diamond, who said she has experienced horrific sexual assault and mistreatment in a men""s prison facility in Georgia. Biden also signed an executive order expanding throughout federal government policy the Supreme Court""s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which held that discrimination based on gender identity constitutes sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The president has long been a supporter of trans rights. He called it the ""civil rights issue of our time"" in 2012. But the most immediate political threat to trans lives is conservative state legislation targeting trans kids. Kai Shappley, a 10-year-old trans girl who caught the nation""s attention with her moving testimony against anti-trans legislation in Texas, thanked the president for his words Wednesday but went on to ask a very sobering question: What will the president do to keep Kai's mom out of jail for supporting her daughter? There are direct actions the White House could take to fight back against the new state-level bills, which the president opposes. In a March 5 press conference, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the president""s position is that these laws are illegal. Biden could deploy the DOJ""s Civil Rights Division to legally fight back against any new anti-trans legislation. That""s the long game. In the short term, the president could help provide resources for relocating any trans families to trans-friendlier states. But most importantly would be passing the Equality Act, which would undermine all of the state laws in one fell swoop. Biden had made a campaign promise to sign the Equality Act within the first 100 days of his administration, a deadline that has now come and gone. The president renewed his call for the Senate to pass the landmark equality legislation in Wednesday night""s speech. Though it passed the House 64 days ago, it has stalled in the Senate. A hearing on the bill was held by the Senate Judiciary Committee in March, but it hasn""t gone any further since then. It""s unclear that Democrats have the required 60 votes to overcome an inevitable conservative filibuster, nor is it obvious that the White House even has 50 votes in the chamber for the bill. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., the quintessential Senate swing vote in this Congress, said in 2017 that he did not support some of the trans provisions in the Equality Act, and nothing since then indicates his position has changed. It""s likely the Senate would need to kill the filibuster to pass the bill. But that remains unlikely as there aren""t enough votes to accomplish that at this time. Manchin recently told Vox he believes the filibuster is essential to the function of the Senate. In a lot of ways, Biden""s hands are tied on the Equality Act — and, by extension, trans rights — but he could lean the White House""s political force into passing the act and saving Kai Shappley""s mom from jail time. If Biden really had trans people""s backs, he""d back it up with actions, not words."
msnbc|"(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NARRATOR (voice-over): A global pandemic with no end in sight, and every government decision could mean life or death. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: If you do not do an adequate response, we will have the deleterious consequence of more infections and more deaths. NARRATOR: Tonight, former Vice President Joe Biden on exactly what he would do differently from President Trump. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Our family members and friends and neighbors are dying while Trump is having a temper tantrum. NARRATOR: But how does the apparent Democratic nominee get his message out in a time of isolation? BIDEN: I`m anxious to go out and campaign. NARRATOR: Tonight, Lawrence O`Donnell goes one-on-one with Joe Biden, and later both joined by Stacey Abrams, a leading voice for the Democrats. STACEY ABRAMS (D), FOUNDER, FAIR FIGHT: I`m working hard to lobby Congress to ensure that we have both by mail in every state. NARRATOR: Her cause, to push for fair and free elections, taking on new urgency in the age of coronavirus. BIDEN: We can both have democracy and elections and, at the same time, correct the public health. NARRATOR: All that, plus your questions. (END VIDEOTAPE) NARRATOR: This is a special edition of ""THE LAST WORD,"" Joe Biden, with Stacey Abrams. LAWRENCE O`DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: When Joe Biden announced his campaign for president just over a year ago, COVID-19 did not exist. But now the coronavirus pandemic threatens the lives of every man, woman and child in the United States. You have heard Joe Biden on all of the other issues that were raised in the several presidential campaign debates. Now it`s time to hear from Joe Biden about the issues that will dominate the rest of the presidential campaign, issues of life and death. If Joe Biden is sworn in as the next president on January 20th, your life and your children`s lives and your parents` lives and your grandparents` lives are going to depend on the work that Joe Biden starts doing that afternoon in the Oval Office, in the Cabinet Room, in the Situation Room. We`re going to ask Joe Biden to take us inside those rooms with him tonight and tell us exactly what he would do on the afternoon of Inauguration Day if he is elected president. And when I say we, I mean you will be joining in the questioning, because we will turn this hour into a town hall of sorts, with questions from you, our viewers, for Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams, when she joins us later in this hour. Stacey Abrams is the head of an organization called Fair Fight, which is devoted to making sure that all voters will be able to cast their votes for president on November 3rd, without any interference with their voting rights. And Stacey Abrams now has the new mission of making sure that you can cast your vote safely in the age of coronavirus, by mail, if necessary. Stacey Abrams will join us later in this hour. We begin tonight with the numbers. As of tonight, there are now 1,422,824 confirmed cases of coronavirus. And, as of tonight, this country has suffered at least 86,179 confirmed deaths from coronavirus. And there is a third number that would be the only number we talk about tonight if it were simply the result of changing economic conditions, instead of it being the result of a deadly pandemic sweeping the world. And that third number is the largest number of people filing for unemployment benefits in the history of the unemployment program, with an additional three million people reported filing today, bringing the total to 36.5 million people claiming unemployment benefits. The unemployment rate is now 14.7 percent and going up from there. That is the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression of the 1930s. And when Democrat Franklin Roosevelt beat an incumbent Republican president in the 1932 election, President Roosevelt was sworn in, in 1933 facing a 25 percent unemployment rate. But he was not also facing a deadly virus that was killing more than 100,000 people, as the coronavirus will surely do before the next presidential inauguration. Joining us now is former Vice President Joe Biden, Democratic candidate for president. Thank you very much for joining us tonight, Mr. Vice President. We really appreciate you being here. We`re going to go straight to this issue of... BIDEN: Lawrence, thanks for having me. O`DONNELL: Thank you. Of -- I want to go right into day one of your presidency. And let`s assume the conditions we have today, because Dr. Fauci, Anthony Fauci, guarantees us -- he has used the word guarantee -- for a second wave. That second wave would surely be breaking in January, combined with the regular flu season. You can imagine 1,700 people dying a day, as there -- as is happening now. We can imagine hundreds of thousands more infections happening throughout the country. And -- and, at the very same time, you have this astronomical, Depression- level unemployment rate. So, your inauguration will be quick. It will not have a parade, if the conditions are the same as today. It will probably take place indoors, maybe in the Rotunda of the Capitol. You will be able to get right back to the Oval Office by 1:00 p.m. You walk back into the West Wing of the White House. The secretary of labor is waiting with the frightening unemployment statistics. Secretary of Health and Human Services is there. Dr. Fauci will probably still be there or will have been rehired by you if he`s been fired. Where do you start? Who do you talk to first? What are the -- what`s the decision sequence? BIDEN: Well, first of all, it`s going to depend on how much worse this president makes it between now and January the 20th of 2021. The fact is that it can get even worse than it is now. He has delayed, delayed, delayed from the very beginning his willingness to go out and deal with this crisis. He`s ignored it. He said it was going to go away, it was going to be a miracle. He wasted an awful lot of time. And I think, as a consequence, an awful lot of lives were lost in the meantime. Coronavirus is not -- he didn`t cause the coronavirus, but he has not reacted well. But one thing you`re going to have to do is, you`re going to have to have, by that time, between the time of being elected and the time of being sworn in, have put together a team of people that are going to deal with this in a way that hadn`t been dealt with up to that point, at least probably will not have been dealt with. One, tell the American people the truth. Look at the science. Put together a board, a pandemic board, like we did in World War II, when President Roosevelt put together a board that related to dealing with how we`re going to deal with World War II. This is a requirement that we have the best people in the world sitting there advising me and the country as to what has to be done. In the meantime, it`s going to matter, Lawrence, whether or not between now and then this president has used his powers and used the organizational ability that the White House has, that the president has to make sure we have enough PPP (sic), those protective gear for this second wave, if there is going to be the second wave, which is predictable, and to make sure we are going to have in place all the tests that we need, all the tests we need, and we are able to track and test, test and follow on when there is an outbreak, where it was, track and trace. All that requires equipment and requires planning and requires time. If that`s been done, the task will be at least easier, it will cost fewer lives. If it has not been done, it will be an absolute, incredible disaster, beyond repair. O`DONNELL: Mr. Vice President, the -- one of the issues you have to deal with in this pandemic, obviously, it`s worldwide, so it`s international relations. China, where this -- this virus began, is still going to be a major factor for you to contend with starting on your first day in the White House. Let`s listen just for a moment about how Donald Trump has dealt with, described his view of China over the course of this pandemic. Let`s just listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: President Xi loves the people of China. He loves his country. And he`s doing a very good job with a very, very tough situation. He is very capable. The country is very capable. It could have been stopped right where it came from, China. And I started calling it the Chinese virus. Could have been stopped in China before it started, and it wasn`t. Ask China that question, OK? (END VIDEO CLIP) O`DONNELL: So, the president goes from saying China is doing a great job to, it`s all China`s fault. How are you going to deal with China? We have -- you have to have some level of cooperation with them in terms of research, in terms of medical supplies, many of which originate in China. But it clearly a difficult relationship to manage, especially with the coronavirus. BIDEN: Well, first of all, the president got it wrong from the beginning, absolutely missed any opportunity to get ahead of this. You know, back in January, I think it was the 27th, when he was saying this, praising China and talking about it not being a problem. We had put together in our administration an office within the White House to deal with future pandemics. They had been briefed on it, they meaning the incoming administration. We had over 44, if I`m not mistaken, people from the CDC in China, in China to observe what was going on. The president brought home the vast majority of them, I think left only four in place. I kept -- I wrote an article back in, I think, the 27th of January saying, we -- there`s -- a pandemic is coming. We should insist on being in China to see for ourselves what was happening, so we could be prepared. The president said, no, no, they`re doing a great job. This -- all this is going -- everything is fine. The fact is that he has not been responsible at all from the very beginning. We lost at least three months of opportunity to get ahead of this, or at least to catch up with it, to catch up with the problem. And so the thing that I`d be doing is resetting that pandemic office in place, number one, making sure we had the CDC, like we did in our administration, forward-based around the world, so we could see these things coming, because there will be more coming. You know, the truth is, Trump was praising the Chinese government and downplaying the threat to the American people, and, as I said, as I was warning -- I was warning the need to get the people into China to see what was actually going on. And the Chinese government`s word, we -- we squandered critical time. And so I just don`t -- and now he`s trying to play this China card. I mean, I don`t know what -- this is an unusual president. O`DONNELL: I want to go to the complexity that -- of what you will be facing on day one, with all those Cabinet members there, obviously the secretary of state. If their nominations are pending, they will still be there. The secretary of state will be concerned with not only the relations with China and all of this, but how a vaccine, once it`s developed, can be distributed throughout the world, because we know, if we don`t crush it throughout the world, it will come back to us. I just wanted... BIDEN: You got it. O`DONNELL: ... you to listen to, for one second, Mr. Vice President, Laurie Garrett, who is an MSNBC contributor now. She`s a Pulitzer Prize winner, has been writing about infectious diseases for many years. She was on this program the other night describing the complexities of the administration of a vaccine, once that vaccine is eventually developed. Let`s listen to the way she described those international complexities. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LAURIE GARRETT, SENIOR FELLOW FOR GLOBAL HEALTH, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS: It requires creating a profit motive scheme of some sort that will -- that brings the industry to the table, without imagining the kind of profit returns they usually want from pharmaceuticals. And that means coming up with agreements with the World Trade Organization and with the trade-related intellectual property agreements, and all sorts of instruments of international law. (END VIDEO CLIP) O`DONNELL: Mr. Vice President, you`re familiar with all those instruments she`s talking about. Most of us are not. The vaccine, if developed, will happen, at the earliest, on the watch of -- in the next presidential term, what would be your first presidential term. Getting that vaccine out in the United States and helping it get distributed to the world would be your job. How would you approach it? BIDEN: Well, look, I`d approach it like we did in our administration when we dealt with Ebola, and we dealt with these other -- we organized the rest of the world. We got the rest of the world to come up with billions of dollars to deal with the problem. We didn`t -- there wasn`t a vaccine at the time. And now guess what has happened? There has been a -- there was an international meeting of all those countries that are trying to work out and find an answer to a vaccine. Everyone showed up except us. The United States was not there, not there. And we, in fact, the president said, we`re the best, we don`t -- basically, we don`t need anybody else`s help. We`re going to have to be in a position to be one of the leaders in the world to figure out how we can make sure that this vaccine is made available first and foremost in our case to the people of the United States of America getting access to it, rural, all people, all people. That is going to be a very difficult thing to figure out how to get it out and around the country. But, in addition to that, there are a lot of nations out there that have no capacity to pay for any of this, and notwithstanding the profit motive. So what we`re going to be in a position of having to do is get other governments to help fund, fund for the rest of the world these vaccines, made available in other parts of the world, because, as you said, Lawrence, we may square it away here. But what happens if there is no vaccine in Central and Latin America? What happens is there is no vaccine in other parts of the world? As we have learned by now, you can`t build a wall high enough to keep out a virus. And so we should be leading the world. And we are once again absent. We`re not even in the discussion. We`re not even in the discussion. What`s going on in London right now, they`re -- in Cambridge, they`re on the verge, they think, of moving forward. If we don`t participate at all, what makes us think we`re going to be in on the deal? We must organize the world to deal with this, so everyone has access. And it`s going to cost all of us. It`s a little -- if I can make an analogy, it`s a little bit like, you know, we have the Amazon burning. And what is happening is, it`s the greatest carbon sink in the world. It absorbs more carbon into the Earth than we emit in a day, every single day and it`s burning. What are we doing? The president is sitting around doing nothing. We should be organizing the world saying, we`re going to raise $20 billion, and we`re going to go to the president of Brazil and say, here`s the deal. We`re going to make sure that you don`t have to burn the Amazon to make a living in your country. This is what we`re going to do. But guess what`s happening? Nothing. We`re doing nothing. The same way things are going to have to happen when you`re going to have all those Europe -- Eastern European countries, those African countries that don`t have the capacity to pay for it. The world is -- in their overwhelming interest of the rest of the world and the major nations of the world, the major economic powers to provide this capacity and has to be organized, organized. O`DONNELL: I want to open it up to our town hall component and get a question from a voter. This first question, Mr. Vice President is from a voter in California. Let listen to this. BIDEN: OK. QUESTION: Hi, Vice President Biden. My name is Namid (ph). I am from San Mateo, California, and thank you for allowing me to participate in this town hall with you. BIDEN: Thank you. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: I`m thinking about that quote from theologian (ph) Kierkegaard that you always recite. Faith sees best in the dark. I find it so profound what is going on in America today, with so many families across this country going through tough times. As someone who has lost a wife and a daughter and a son and knows what it`s like to go through loss, what advice would you give to a family who has lost someone to COVID- 19? Thank you. BIDEN: Well, first of all, you know, the folks who have recently lost someone to COVID-19 over 86 -- almost 87,000 of them now, they feel like there`s a black hole in the middle of their chest, they are being sucked into it and frightened and scared and don`t know what to do. All I can tell them is that it will take time. But in time, what`s going to happen is you`re going to find when you think of that son, daughter, husband, wife, mother, father you lost, you`re going to get a smile on your lip before you get a tear in your eye, and that`s when you know you`re going to make it. And the way you make it, at least in my experience, is so many people have gone through so much more than I have, losing a wife, and a daughter and then a son to cancer is that you have to -- you have to have a purpose. You have to have purpose. Purpose will drive you to be able to get -- to control your life. And the purpose will be many of these people, what do we do to make life better, better for other people? How could we have avoided what happened here? What are the things you want to do? Are we going to do things like making sure those first responders that lost their lives and those are the remainder who are getting paid essentially minimum wage, get a fair deal? They`re carrying us on their back. They`re carrying the country on their back right now, and they`re not being treated with dignity and respect. I think the way they`ll find -- but right now, that`s no solace to anybody that recently lost somebody. It`s of no solace. But what I have to say is they`re still with you. They`re in your heart, part of your soul, it`s who you are. And you`ve got to have faith the time will come, the time will come when you`ll get through this veil of darkness. You really will. But the best way to get through it is with a sense of purpose and realizing he or she is with you. They`re in you. They`re part of you. They never go away, and they`ll advice you and they`ll be there with you. And you`ve got to move. You just got to get up. As my dad would say, you know, when you get knocked down, you just got to get up, just get up. And think of yourself, what would they want you to do? Would they want you to do? They`d want you to get up. They`d want you to be safe. They want you to move on. That`s all I can really say, quite frankly. It`s of no solace to anybody who`s recently lost someone, and this is all been recent. O`DONNELL: Mr. Vice President, before we go to a break, before we bring in Stacey Abrams, I want to ask you about the Tara Reade story. And you served in the Senate for about 36 years. Senator from Delaware, you were chairman of committees. Having worked in the Senate myself, I`m just in my head doing the numbers. You have to have had well over 1,000 Senate staffers between the committee staff, the Delaware Senate staff. Do you remember Tara Reade who worked there for about a year in 1992, `93? BIDEN: To be honest with you, I don`t. Look, let me get something clear. When a woman makes a claim that she has been harassed or abused, and this claim has changed, has gone up, but harassed or abused, she should be taken seriously. She should come forward, share her story, she should be taken seriously, and should be thoroughly vetted. And in every case, what matters is the truth. Truth is what matters. And the truth of the case is nothing like this ever, ever happened. She has a right to be heard but then should be vetted, and the truth ultimately matters. And I give you my word, it never ever happened. O`DONNELL: Let me ask you about a piece, it was an op-ed piece in ""The New York Times"" recently by Linda Hirshman and it was entitled ""I believe Tara Reade, I`m voting for Joe Biden anyway."" And this is an accusation that she says there were no witnesses to this, it happened in a semi- or in a public place the way she describes it in the basement of the Senate. That might sound like a private place but as you and I both know, that`s a thoroughfare, that`s a very busy area. But there are no witnesses to it, so it`s your word saying it didn`t happen and now her version of it that it did happen. What do you say to women who were ready to vote for Joe Biden, eager to vote for Joe Biden but this gives them serious pause because they do believe Tara Reade, and you`re not going to change their mind about that? What would you say to them about their vote? BIDEN: Well, I think they should vote their heart. If they believe Tara Reade, they probably shouldn`t vote for me. I wouldn`t vote for me if I believe Tara Reade. The fact is that -- look at Tara Reade`s story. It changes considerably. And so, but I don`t want to question her motive. I don`t want to question anything other than to say the truth matters. This is being vetted. It`s been vetted. They went and people interviewed scores of my employees over my whole career. This is just totally, thoroughly, completely out of character, and the idea that in a public place in a hallway, I would assault a woman? I mean, it`s -- I mean -- anyway, I promise you, it never happened. It should be vetted. She should be thoroughly looked at and whether or not these happened, look at the story, follow the story line and determine whether there`s any truth to it. And there is no truth to it. I promise you. O`DONNELL: I want to go back to where we began, which is this possibility of a Biden inauguration day in January, which would be in the middle of the second wave. It could be a very dark time. And when we think of inaugural addresses, of course, the one many people remember vividly word for word, John Fitzgerald Kennedy saying, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country. It seems like if you`re delivering the next inaugural address, that formulation is going to be reversed because everyone in this country is going to be looking at you and saying, what can you do for me? I am out of work, I need a job. I have lost my mother. I`ve lost my brother. I am suffering. That is going to be it seems to me a moment where a president is going to have to say what that president can do for them. What will you say? BIDEN: I will say, I guarantee you, number one, I will tell you the truth. The American people is a -- to paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt -- the American people are strong. They`re tough. They know -- they want to know the truth. They can handle the truth. What they can`t handle is lie or lies. I will be level with them straight up. I`ll tell them what the science is as best we know it. I`ll lay out to them how in fact we can -- once we get by re-stimulating the economy and getting people back moving so they`re able to keep their homes and keep their apartments and being able to have the food available on their tables that they need. That in the meantime, while we have unemployment, if the unemployment rate is as high as it is now or higher like it was with Roosevelt, I will tell them the government -- the government has an obligation to see to it that you are held harmless in terms of being able to -- where you live, being able to pay for your medical bills, being able to do whatever you need to do to take care of your family. And then I will tell them what I`m going to do when I bend this curve and break it so that we`re in a position that we`re going to rebuild the country. We`re going to rebuild this country better than it was found. That`s no solace to someone who lost a family member, but we`re going to rebuild it better than we found it. Look, Lawrence, I talked a lot. I`ve been on your program before talking about -- even before I announced I was going to run, restoring the soul of America. We`re seeing the soul of America now. Average Americans doing extraordinary things, risking -- in some cases, giving their lives -- to carry the rest of us on their back, whether they`re grocery store clerks or truck drivers or whether they are people working as nurses or people working as child aides, whatever. We have to right the wrongs that are being exposed that exist now. All those people are doing that are the people that most -- most people did not spend a lot of time. Did not spend a lot of time thinking about, and now they`ve seen how courageous they have been, what they have done. It`s time to make it right. And we can begin to do that by providing a recovery that in fact, will create millions of new jobs, making sure that we`re building a new infrastructure, putting people to work in ways that deal with the institutional racism and institutional barriers that have existed. And I`ll explain what those are and how we`re going to get to it. O`DONNELL: All right. We`re going to take a break here. Mr. Vice President, just please stay with us. When we return -- BIDEN: Sure. O`DONNELL: -- we`re going to be joined in our discussion by Stacey Abrams. Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams on television together for the first time. That`s next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) O`DONNELL: In her last campaign in 2018, Stacey Abrams came with 1.5 percent of winning the race for governor in Georgia. The Abrams taught Democrats two things. One, Georgia can be a competitive state if they can get out the vote. And two, Republicans will do everything they can to prevent Democrats from getting their voters to the polls. Stacey Abrams has used that experience to form the mission statement of Fair Fight, an organization devoted to making sure that all voters will be able to cast their votes for president on November 3rd without any interference with their voting rights. Former Vice President Joe Biden is back with us and joining our discussion now from Atlanta is Stacey Abrams, the founder of Fair Fight, an organization fighting for fair and free elections with voter protection teams in 18 battleground states. Stacey Abrams, thank you very much for joining us tonight, and pardon me for a minute because I want to begin this with a question to Joe Biden -- because Stacey Abrams is here because Joe Biden invited Stacey Abrams to be here. And so, Mr. Vice President, do you have an announcement to make? Is this an audition? Is there -- what is the reason that you decided it`s time for me to get on TV with Stacey Abrams? BIDEN: Well, because Stacey Abrams has done more to deal with the fair vote and making sure there is a fair vote than anybody and she -- I mean, she has a great, great capacity to explain things and to lay out exactly why it`s going to be so critically important in this election. This president already said when they put in the stimulus package the Congress first passed money to provide for mail-in ballots, he already said, I`m not for that, if we do that, no Republican will ever win, or something to that effect. He`s made it clear -- this is a guy who said he wants to defund the Post Office from being able to deliver ballots. I mean -- so Stacey knows what she`s doing and she`s an incredibly capable person. O`DONNELL: All right. Let`s actually listen to what Donald Trump said about mail-in ballots. We have that here. And full disclosure before you listen to what Donald Trump says about this, the one thing I have in common with Donald Trump is that we both vote by mail. Now let`s listen to this. (LAUGHTER) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: So, the problem with the mail-in ballots, it`s subject to tremendous corruption, tremendous corruption, cheating. And so I`m against it. (END VIDEO CLIP) O`DONNELL: Stacey Abrams, he`s against it. A lot of Republicans are against whatever it is you`re trying to do, whatever your next idea is that you think will help get out the vote. And so, they used to be in favor of mail-in ballots. And now here we are. ABRAMS: Well, I first want to say, thank you for having me. And thank you to Vice President Biden for including me in on this conversation. Whether you`re thinking about what happened in Georgia in 2018, when thousands of Georgians were denied the right to be heard, or what we saw happen in Wisconsin, where 52 people, at last count, contracted COVID because they were forced to cast their ballot in person, we know that vote by mail is the safest and most accessible way of making sure that every American can be heard on November 3. The reality is that it`s safe, that there is no fraud of any consequence. In fact, in every single state that has used vote by mail regularly, Oregon for the last 20 years, the number of people who have committed fraud is negotiable. But what is more telling is that they don`t want the voices of people suffering from COVID-19, suffering from a collapsed economy, and suffering from the cowardice of Donald Trump, they don`t want their voices heard at the ballot. But what we can do through the HEROES package is ensure that everyone in America who wants to vote by mail can do so, but we can also create accessible spaces for people to vote in person early and in person on the day of, because, if you`re disabled, if you`re homeless, if you have been displaced by COVID, if you have language barriers, and if you`re Native American, we need you to be able to go into those polling places, but to make sure that there is enough space to meet the CDC guidelines. We have got to get as many people as possible to vote by mail. Every state can do it. We simply have to invest in it and put in the guardrails to make it possible for every American who is eligible to vote. O`DONNELL: The -- we`re concentrating on COVID-19 tonight, because no presidential campaign has ever experienced anything like this. It`s obviously going to be the most important thing that the president faces after the next inauguration. But the world does not stop for the president on all other issues of concern. And Stacey Abrams, in Georgia, for example, we saw the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery. And there is an example of where the tensions, the kind of racial tensions and value issues that actually got Joe Biden into this campaign, according to his campaign announcement, came to us in a graphic and very, very disturbing way. Are you concerned that, in the next presidency, with the president concentrated so much on the pandemic, that it will be very difficult to get presidential attention to issues like the kind of racial injustice that we have seen in that incident? ABRAMS: Not at all, not if we have a president of competence and courage like Joe Biden. Let`s remember that not only was moments of COVID-19 at the same time the United States did. If South Korea can hold the largest most invested election in the midst of COVID-19 on April 15th, we can get this done by November but only if we pass the Heroes Act and get it done now. O`DONNELL: Vice President Biden, before we go to the next break, there is a bipartisan bill developing in the House of Representatives that we discussed on this program that would allow -- authorized funding for hiring 100,000 contact tracers to go to work throughout the United States. This would be basically a jobs program desperately needed and obviously fulfilling a very critical tool in fighting the coronavirus desperately needed. Do you support that? BIDEN: I strongly support it. And a lot of those people are the people that worked the job corps, the people who have worked in Peace Corps and other public service jobs. We know -- we know that until there is a vaccine, the only fundamental way to change the dynamic is test and trace. Test and trace. And hiring these people will provide jobs, number one, but even more importantly, it will allow us to gain control of the spread of this virus. Tracing, tracing, contact tracing, that is critically important and I strongly support it. O`DONNELL: We`re going to squeeze in a final break here. Joe Biden, Stacey Abrams, please stay with us. We`re going to be right back right after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) O`DONNELL: And we`re back with more of your questions for Vice President Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams. Let go to the next question. QUESTION: My name is Jackie Okomo (ph) from Stockton, California. I have a question for Vice President Biden. As an immigrant working as a nurse, we have provided the care for all without prejudice during the COVID pandemic. How do you plan to change the immigration laws to accommodate specialized immigrants towards a fast-track immigration process, to accommodate such crisis? BIDEN: By the way, number one, on day one I`m sending, no matter what the state of this is, to the United States Congress a bill to provide for a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, number one, in the United States. Number two, every DACA student will be able to stay. You realize there are 40,000 DACA students out there who are providing the kind of help we`re talking about right now in hospitals, as nurses` aides, as fire -- I mean, across the board? They`re doing incredible things for us now. And the idea that we treat -- that the president has pitted us against one another based on our race, religion, national origin, we are a land of immigrants. That`s what`s made us who we are. That`s what makes us so resilient. That`s what makes us so special. And I promise you, it`s a gigantic objective of mine to see to it that we make a -- that we have an immigration system that`s consistent with our values and who we say we are, and it does not now. Donald Trump is absolutely violating every basic value we have. O`DONNELL: What about fast-tracking the immigration process for physicians, nurses, other medical personnel? BIDEN: Yes, yes, and yes. (CROSSTALK) O`DONNELL: Great. We need answers like that so we can get in more questions. Let`s go -- let`s go to another question from one of our voters. QUESTION: Hi. I`m Glenda from Ohio. As a Democrat, it`s just as important to win the Senate as it is to win the White House. I want to know why Stacey Abrams wasn`t willing to run for the Senate in order to help the party but is willing to accept the role of vice president. ABRAMS: I appreciate the question. I personally say that -- BIDEN: She`s capable of doing any or both. (LAUGHTER) ABRAMS: Well, I would say this. I think we have to remember there are two things happening in 2020. We`re not only running a presidential election, but we`re running the 2010 election as well. That means we have to think about not winning the White House and the Senate, but we`ve got to win down ballot races, especially winning state legislatures in order to avoid the debacle that happened when Republicans gerrymandered our maps beyond recognition. That`s why I`m not only fighting for a fair fight in our elections and fighting for a fair fight in our Census, making sure everyone is counted so the Republicans can`t weaponize the Census against our people. I didn`t run for the Senate because I don`t believe that every job is interchangeable, and I`m not in politics to stay in office. I`m here to do the work and the work I thought was most important is making sure that we had free and fair elections across this country. I did that through Fair Fight. That we had a census that will count every American and every person in America through fair count, but also to respond to how COVID is ravaging the South. I live in a community and in a state where we have some of the highest infection rates and where we have some of the lowest resilience because the resources we need, the infrastructure we need has been broken. My interest is in making certain that Vice President Joe Biden becomes President Biden because we need someone who believes not only in thinking the right thoughts but doing the work. And this is a man of courage and competence who helped lead us through a global crisis before, and he can do it again. My interest is no matter what, that I help make certain that Joe Biden is the next president of the United States, that we win every election up and down the ballot so that we can right-size our country and move our nation forward. O`DONNELL: Our next question is from Ohio -- BIDEN: And we`ll win back the Senate. O`DONNELL: -- from Edward in Ohio, and this is for Vice President Biden. QUESTION: Sir, if you were to win the election, would you be willing to commit to not pulling the president forward and giving Donald Trump a pardon under the pretense of healing the nation? In other words, are you willing to commit to the American ideal that no one is above the law? BIDEN: Absolutely yes. I commit. O`DONNELL: And this is helping us get in all the more questions, so that`s a commitment. Mr. Vice President, you`re saying that wherever the investigative trail might lead, whether that be an investigative trail pursued by the Justice Department against Trump officials, Trump associates, administration officials, whether those are congressional investigations, that`s hands off for you? You`re not going to say, let`s just let bygones be bygones? BIDEN: It`s hands off completely. Look, the attorney general is not the president`s lawyer. It`s the people`s lawyer. And you remember when you were there with Pat Moynihan. We never saw anything like the prostitution of that office like we see it today. It is not something the president is entitled to do, to direct either a prosecution and/or decide to drop a case. That is not the president`s role, responsibility, and it`s a dereliction of his duty, and a dereliction of the duty as a -- you know, you have what? Whether 2,000 was it or former attorneys general or people who worked in the office that said the present attorney general should resign. What`s going on is an absolute travesty, a travesty of justice. That will not happen, I guarantee you. O`DONNELL: The issue of people wanting the vice president -- wanting the attorney general to resign is over the Michael Flynn case where the attorney general is basically trying to drop the case as a federal judge questioning how that case is being dropped. Mr. Vice President, what was your involvement in the investigation of Michael Flynn and the FBI investigation of Michael Flynn? BIDEN: I was never a part or had any knowledge of any criminal investigation into Flynn while I was in office, period. Not one single time. O`DONNELL: Let`s get one more question in here. This is from a voter in California. QUESTION: Hi, Vice President Biden and Ms. Abrams. My name is Victor Xi (ph). I`m a 17-year-old, a senior at Stephenson High School in Illinois and just got elected to be a delegate to represent Vice President Joe Biden at the DNC convention in August on behalf of Illinois` 10th congressional district. Today, my question is for Stacey Abrams. Given that young people and high schoolers like myself don`t often turn out to vote in elections, how do you ensure that not only high schoolers and college students are empowered in the political process but also turn out to vote at higher rates? ABRAMS: Well, I`ve been working on this since I was 17. I started registering students to vote on my college campus before I was old enough to vote. I was sent as an international fellow to Austria to represent the United States on the conversation of youth civic engagement when I was 21. It`s because I believe in the voice of young people. I know that young people change the world, and not long ago I was one. But what I know more than that is that this cannot simply be an academic conversation. That`s why my campaign in 2018, we had young people at every level of our campaign. And in our work that we`re doing now, from the work we`re doing in southwest Georgia, helping to respond to COVID-19, to the work of counting folks in the census, we are engaging young people, especially college and high school age students. Your voices matter because this world is a world you will inherit, but it`s also a world you have to survive. That means that we have to focus on issues of climate change, criminal justice. We have to make sure that health care and economic justice are part of every single decision, and that happens by speaking directly to you. But more importantly, engaging you and setting the policies themselves. I know that Joe Biden believes in youth engagement because he ran for the Senate at the age of 29. And he knows that like I do that we can`t win this nation if we don`t have everyone pulling in the same direction, especially your generation. O`DONNELL: Vice President Biden, we have seen -- BIDEN: Your generation owns this election. O`DONNELL: We have seen a whistle-blower testify at the House of Representatives today, Dr. Rick Bright, saying that his cautions, his predictions about what were happening, what was coming in this coronavirus pandemic, were ignored, were suppressed in effect. We have reports indicating that the CDC has not been able to issue the warnings that they want to be able to issue. Donald Trump has repeatedly said the sentence this week, I disagree with Anthony Fauci. In your administration, will the scientists, will the medical professionals be allowed to speak freely? Will you allow them all to testify to Congress whenever Congress requests them? Will you allow them to speak to the media? BIDEN: Absolutely -- absolutely, positively. Yes, yes, yes again. Really and truly. It is all about the science. This president is absolutely -- well, I shouldn`t say it. He does not -- he does whatever is in his interest, takes no responsibility, does whatever in his interest, and we have the problem we have right now. And -- and I hope if I`m president that Dr. Fauci will stay on in the administration. O`DONNELL: And that will be tonight`s last word. Joe Biden gets the last word. Stacey Abrams, thank you very much for joining us. Vice President Joe Biden, thank you for joining us. This has been a special LAST WORD. ""THE 11TH HOUR"" with Brian Williams will be up next. BRIAN WILLIAMS, MSNBC HOST: Well, good evening once again. Day 1211 of this Trump administration, 173 days until our next presidential election. The President wondered aloud in his public remarks today about whether or not coronavirus testing is over rated. He said it could be overrated. END"
msnbc|"As President Franklin D. Roosevelt put it when he coined the term ""the first 100 days"" during one of his early fireside chats, ""I think that we all wanted the opportunity of a little quiet thought to examine and assimilate in a mental picture the crowding events of the hundred days which had been devoted to the starting of the wheels of the New Deal."" The important takeaway was that Roosevelt gave himself and the American people milestones to assess not only the intent of the new administration, but also the measure of its success. The responsibility of those we elect to lead, whether during a depression or a pandemic coupled with tectonic social unrest, is to be an honest broker on our behalf. They must be fearless in enacting policies that encourage greater economic growth and social reforms; and visionary in fostering a climate that promotes job creation while remaining responsive to the welfare of those all too often left behind as growth takes hold. Leadership matters. Much of what has been written and said about President Joseph R. Biden overlooks this essential quality to his success. His time as both a senator and vice president positioned him well to understand that passing a big agenda — be it social or economic — requires the discipline of leadership. His immediate predecessor failed to pass much of anything — perhaps because he lacked both discipline and leadership. People are acutely aware of what is happening right now across the country. From Covid-19 recovery to racial inequality and policing, Americans are closely monitoring how well Biden is managing these rather difficult and highly charged issues. As he has crafted his policy on the pandemic and now infrastructure, Biden has shrewdly sat down with us at the proverbial kitchen table to explain what he wants to do and why. Even more importantly, he has asked us to help by doing our part. Biden""s approach is quite different from what we have seen from other presidents in recent years. He seems less concerned with the obvious Democrat vs. Republican rancor. Perhaps, it is because he is familiar with the ways of Washington and knows the political divides that block progress are mostly designed for partisan showboating. It should surprise no one that he has so far steered around such resistance and engaged more directly and personally with voters. And it""s working. Not only does a recent Pew Research Center poll have his job approval at 59 percent, but also the latest NBC News poll has 69 percent of Americans approving of the president""s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and 52 percent approving of how he""s managing the economy. And even though his approval is upside down with voters on China (35 percent), the gun issue (34 percent) and border security/immigration (33 percent), the American public does not seem generally to be holding those issues against him. The difference is leadership; and people are warming to Biden""s brand. As one NBC News poll respondent noted, ""The best thing about Joe Biden is I don't have to think about Joe Biden."" In other words, they trust him. It is against this overall narrative that Republicans find themselves struggling to make their political hits against Biden stick. Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., notes, ""I don't think we've done a very good job because he's getting away with defining himself and rolling out this stuff that we're borrowing every penny for it, and the public is buying it. We've got to find ways to articulate and scuffle in a better way, and I don't know that we've found that."" Republicans and even some progressives may want to see Biden""s first 100 days through a strictly partisan/ideological lens in which the administration is spending too much and getting it all wrong. But voters, at least for now, think the president is getting it right — or at least making it better. The American people want safety and they want normalcy. Parents want their kids back in school; small-business owners want to welcome back their customers; and everyone wants hugs and handshakes to replace sanitizers and masks. Biden thinks he can make that happen, and folks so far believe him. The president has demonstrated his concern and his compassion for everyday people. He is helping them look forward, not backward. He is raising their spirits rather than stoking their fears. He accepts the bottom line of leadership — the buck stops here — rather than blaming others. For countless Americans, that""s enough for them to ""examine and assimilate in a mental picture"" what leadership looks like. And so far, they like what they see."
msnbc|"In his Wednesday evening address to a joint session of Congress, President Joe Biden made perhaps the most pro-transgender comment in the history of presidential addresses. ""To all the transgender Americans watching at home — especially the young people who are so brave — I want you to know that your president has your back,"" he said. He""s not the first president to mention the word ""transgender"" in an address to Congress — that honor goes to Barack Obama — and Biden""s words were meant to carry significant weight for an American trans community under legislative siege at the state level. But trans people need more than just words right now. So far this year, eight anti-LGBTQ bills have been enacted into law, and over 250 anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced in at least 30 states, according to the Human Rights Campaign. These attacks on trans people are primarily focused on kids and adolescents. Arkansas enacted a bill earlier this month that banned transition-related care — like puberty blockers or hormone replacement therapy — for trans adolescents. Eight states, including Arkansas, have passed bans on trans girls playing girls interscholastic sports. A bill currently being discussed in Texas would classify affirming trans children as child abuse, and parents of trans kids could risk losing custody of their kids or even face jail time under the bill. It""s LGBTQ criminalization to a level not seen in this country for decades, and the bills threaten to further marginalize or outright drive trans people out of swaths of states across the conservative South. Marginalized groups of people have, of course, been forced to move to avoid state-sponsored persecution before, but such a thing hasn""t happened in the U.S. in a very long time. The White House has done some early and important work on trans rights during its first 100 days. Most recently, the Department of Justice got involved in the case of trans prisoner Ashley Diamond, who said she has experienced horrific sexual assault and mistreatment in a men""s prison facility in Georgia. Biden also signed an executive order expanding throughout federal government policy the Supreme Court""s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which held that discrimination based on gender identity constitutes sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The president has long been a supporter of trans rights. He called it the ""civil rights issue of our time"" in 2012. But the most immediate political threat to trans lives is conservative state legislation targeting trans kids. Kai Shappley, a 10-year-old trans girl who caught the nation""s attention with her moving testimony against anti-trans legislation in Texas, thanked the president for his words Wednesday but went on to ask a very sobering question: What will the president do to keep Kai's mom out of jail for supporting her daughter? There are direct actions the White House could take to fight back against the new state-level bills, which the president opposes. In a March 5 press conference, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the president""s position is that these laws are illegal. Biden could deploy the DOJ""s Civil Rights Division to legally fight back against any new anti-trans legislation. That""s the long game. In the short term, the president could help provide resources for relocating any trans families to trans-friendlier states. But most importantly would be passing the Equality Act, which would undermine all of the state laws in one fell swoop. Biden had made a campaign promise to sign the Equality Act within the first 100 days of his administration, a deadline that has now come and gone. The president renewed his call for the Senate to pass the landmark equality legislation in Wednesday night""s speech. Though it passed the House 64 days ago, it has stalled in the Senate. A hearing on the bill was held by the Senate Judiciary Committee in March, but it hasn""t gone any further since then. It""s unclear that Democrats have the required 60 votes to overcome an inevitable conservative filibuster, nor is it obvious that the White House even has 50 votes in the chamber for the bill. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., the quintessential Senate swing vote in this Congress, said in 2017 that he did not support some of the trans provisions in the Equality Act, and nothing since then indicates his position has changed. It""s likely the Senate would need to kill the filibuster to pass the bill. But that remains unlikely as there aren""t enough votes to accomplish that at this time. Manchin recently told Vox he believes the filibuster is essential to the function of the Senate. In a lot of ways, Biden""s hands are tied on the Equality Act — and, by extension, trans rights — but he could lean the White House""s political force into passing the act and saving Kai Shappley""s mom from jail time. If Biden really had trans people""s backs, he""d back it up with actions, not words."
cnn|"David Axelrod, a senior CNN political commentator and host of ""The Axe Files,"" was senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chief strategist for the 2008 and 2012 Obama presidential campaigns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)Much has been made of the spectacular flop that was President Trump's planned campaign re-launch in Tulsa over the weekend. But one of the most revealing moments got too little attention. It was almost an afterthought in the middle of a nearly two-hour speech and improv when Trump rolled out his principal attack on Joe Biden. And in doing so, Trump also tipped his hand as to why he feared Biden so much that he bought himself an impeachment trying to dirty up the former Vice President. ""If the Democrats gain power, then the rioters will be in charge and no one will be safe and no one will have control,"" proclaimed the self-styled ""law-and-order president"" in the midst of his long, disorderly presentation. ""Joe Biden is not the leader of his party. Joe Biden is a helpless puppet of the radical left."" The lines he appeared to ad-lib about Biden next were unintentionally revealing. ""He's not radical left. I don't think he knows what he is anymore, but he was never radical left. But he's controlled by the radical left, and now he's really controlled."" Donald Trump is a cultural warrior. His politics depends on mining the fear and resentment of white, working class voters who feel they are on the losing end of economic and demographic change. Joe Biden is culturally inconvenient for Trump's re-election project. An older, white, Irish Catholic from a working class Pennsylvania family, Biden is just not frightening enough to the voters Trump needs to scare. Trump has recognized this from the start. It's why he leaned so hard on the President of Ukraine last summer to open a baseless investigation into Biden and his son Hunter's board membership of a Ukrainian energy company. Now Trump has the match up he hoped to avoid. And his comments on Saturday underscored both why he fears Biden and what line of attack he will attempt to use to shove the race back into the cultural framework Trump believes will motivate his base. (Whether his base is large enough to win is another story.) Trump's acknowledgment that Biden is not ""radical left,"" was an admission that to try to paint the former VP as extreme was a losing proposition. So instead, Trump will try to portray Biden as the addled, doddering tool, too weak to resist the gravitational pull of the Left. Trump is relying on Biden's occasionally uneven performances to support his argument. But Biden has been relatively disciplined in his comments since the Covid-19 outbreak began, and his team has been strategic about how and where he has appeared, mainly via Zoom, while it is Trump who has suffered from overexposure. The President who suggested to the nation that consuming disinfectant might be a ready cure for Covid-19 opens himself up to a vicious counterpunch if he stakes his candidacy on attacking another man's mental acuity. Yet that is where he is going. That is the best shot he has. Biden's most salient qualities -- empathy, decency, experience -- have always offered a valuable contrast to Trump's most glaring deficiencies as a leader. They have become even more pronounced in this period of trial and unrest, during which the cost of Trump's narcissism, divisiveness and inability to manage crises has come into sharper focus. In February, the odds favored the re-election of the president. Today, they have shifted in favor of the challenger. This was symbolized by the startling sea of empty blue seats Trump confronted in Tulsa, as he offered up a melange of 1970 culture war hits: flag-burning, leftist mob rule, socialism, the confiscation of guns and toppling of Confederate icons. Still, as Trump madly pushes these tried and true buttons, he's not getting the desired reaction. He is underperforming among the non-college white and evangelical voters whose overwhelming support facilitated his narrow electoral victory over Hillary Clinton four years ago. Add this to a seismic move among suburban voters against Trump, who carried the suburbs in 2016, and a lesser but significant shift from voters over 65 who also favored Trump in '16 but now give Biden the edge, and you can see the president's challenge. Biden's age, background and demographic profile may have been an obstacle in nailing down the nomination of an increasingly diverse Democratic Party, but it is working for him now. For a white culture warrior like Trump, old Joe Biden is proving to be a vexing target."
cnn|"(CNN)Cindy McCain, the widow of longtime Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, said Tuesday night on Twitter that she endorses Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. The endorsement -- 12 years after she was a potential First Lady and had the Republican Party behind her and her husband -- follows McCain's appearance in a video about Biden's relationship with McCain at the Democratic National Convention in August. McCain offered her endorsement on Twitter after Biden had told donors she was supporting him. ""My husband John lived by a code: country first. We are Republicans, yes, but Americans foremost. There's only one candidate in this race who stands up for our values as a nation, and that is @JoeBiden,"" she said in a series of tweets. ""Joe and I don't always agree on the issues, and I know he and John certainly had some passionate arguments, but he is a good and honest man. He will lead us with dignity,"" she said. ""He will be a commander in chief that the finest fighting force in the history of the world can depend on, because he knows what it is like to send a child off to fight."" Biden tweeted in reply, ""Cindy — I'm deeply honored to have your support and your friendship. This election is bigger than any one political party. It requires all of us to come together as one America to restore the soul of the nation. Together, we'll get it done."" At a virtual fundraiser Tuesday, Biden had told attendees that Cindy McCain's decision to endorse him followed President Donald Trump's comments, as reported by The Atlantic, referring to those killed and injured in wartime as ""losers"" and ""suckers."" John McCain was a prisoner of war in Vietnam after his plane was shot down on a bombing mission. The injuries he sustained in Vietnam led to lifelong disabilities, including the inability to raise his arms over his head. ""Maybe I shouldn't say it, but I'm about to go on one of these Zooms with John McCain's wife, who is -- first time ever -- is endorsing me because of what he talks about with my son and (John), who are heroes, who served their country. You know he said they're losers, they're suckers,"" Biden said. Cindy McCain discussed her endorsement of Biden in interviews with three broadcast networks Wednesday morning, leaning heavily into his character and empathy in her pitch for the Democratic candidate. McCain said that she is hoping to reach suburban women who may be on the fence with her voice. She said during an interview on ""CBS This Morning"" that she was the one who reached out to Biden about the endorsement because she saw ""a lack of character, integrity, a lack of values, presented by the person who is in charge."" In an interview on NBC's ""Today,"" McCain said the former vice president's empathy played a key factor in her decision to support the Democratic presidential nominee. ""I want to feel like my president cares about me and cares about my country, and Joe Biden does,"" she said, later adding, ""Joe has great empathy for people in this country."" McCain affirmed Biden's comment that the Atlantic report was ""pretty much"" the last straw for her. ""It's a combination of things, but I do believe that our men and women that served in the military are not losers and certainly the men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice are not losers,"" she said. ""I think that respect for the men and women who serve us and served this nation and protect us it's important that we respect and care for them."" Asked if she's disappointed in South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham -- a longtime ally of the late senator -- and other Republicans in their ardent support of Trump, she said ""No."" ""Lindsey is an old and very dear friend and I will always love him and he's just like a member of my family,"" she said. ""Republicans that are -- that believe and are doing what they're doing, it's certainly their prerogative to do so. I just believe, I think things should be different."" McCain said she hopes her husband is ""happy with what I'm doing and believes that I've done the right thing."" The high-profile endorsement from the widow of the 2008 Republican presidential nominee comes as Biden attempts to peel off independents and Republicans alienated by Trump's comments and actions -- including in Arizona, which has emerged as a major electoral battleground. Trump has frequently attacked John McCain by name, including in 2015, when he said he didn't consider McCain a war hero because he preferred those who were not captured. He again went after the late senator Wednesday morning, criticizing him for ""endless wars"" and the state of the Veterans Administration. ""Biden was John McCain's lapdog,"" Trump tweeted. In a video at this year's Democratic convention, Cindy McCain was featured. ""My husband and Vice President Biden enjoyed a 30+ year friendship dating back to before their years serving together in the Senate, so I was honored to accept the invitation from the Biden campaign to participate in a video celebrating their relationship,"" she said in a tweet about the video. This story and headline have been updated with McCain's endorsement. CNN's Arlette Saenz and Caroline Kenny contributed to this report."
cnn|"Washington (CNN)New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker endorsed Joe Biden for president on Monday, the latest high-profile supporter to back the former vice president. ""The answer to hatred & division is to reignite our spirit of common purpose. @JoeBiden won't only win - he'll show there's more that unites us than divides us,"" Booker tweeted. ""He'll restore honor to the Oval Office and tackle our most pressing challenges. That's why I'm proud to endorse Joe."" Booker will join Biden for events in Flint, Michigan, and Detroit, a Biden campaign official told CNN. Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Biden retweeted Booker's post Monday afternoon, saying he is ""incredibly grateful"" for the senator's endorsement. ""Cory — Your leadership has given hope to so many and has inspired our nation to rise to meet the challenges of today,"" he said. ""I'm incredibly grateful for your endorsement — and I look forward to working alongside you to unite the country and defeat Donald Trump."" Booker is the latest former 2020 rival to endorse Biden as he looks to consolidate establishment backing. The New Jersey senator's endorsement -- coming a day after California Sen. Kamala Harris offered her support -- will likely be cited by Biden ahead of critical primary elections on Tuesday. Recently, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who were among Biden's most notable challengers in the centrist lane of the Democratic field, also endorsed his candidacy. Biden has a double-digit lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a CNN poll released Monday. Booker, who ended his campaign in January after failing to qualify for the Democratic debate ahead of the Iowa caucuses, occasionally clashed with Biden on a number of issues, including the former vice president's remarks in which he touted his time working with segregationist senators. ""You don't joke about calling black men 'boys.' Men like James O. Eastland used words like that, and the racist policies that accompanied them, to perpetuate white supremacy and strip black Americans of our very humanity,"" Booker said in a statement at the time. When Biden suggested Booker should be the one to apologize, Booker told CNN at the time, ""I was raised to speak truth to power and that I shall never apologize for doing that."" He added, ""And Vice President Biden shouldn't need this lesson."" They also sparred over policy proposals, including criminal justice reform. Debating with Biden on criminal justice reform during the Democratic debate in July, Booker criticized the former vice president. ""There's a saying in my community that you're dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don't even know the flavor,"" he said. ""You need to come to the city of Newark and see the reforms we put in place."" During an interview with CBS on Monday, Booker was asked about his support for Biden after his criticism of the former vice president regarding criminal justice reform. ""Well, first of all, I love Joe Biden. He and I have had a great relationship for a long time,"" he said. ""I wouldn't have run against him if I didn't think I was the best person to be the next president of the United States, but I'm out of the race."" ""And as I look at him,"" he continued. ""I know factually from talking to him that some of my biggest issues like criminal justice reform, like racial justice, like economic justice, that he is going to be a strong leader on that and can actually pull the country together -- the kind of coalitions we need to actually make progress in those areas."" This story has been updated to include additional reporting and background information. CNN's Arlette Saenz contributed to this report."
cnn|"(CNN)Hillary Clinton endorsed Joe Biden during a virtual town hall on Tuesday, putting the support of the Democratic standard bearer from four years ago behind the former vice president and current presumptive presidential nominee. Clinton touted Biden as a ""friend"" and a figure who has been ""preparing for this moment his entire life,"" as she lambasted President Donald Trump as someone who is so ill prepared to be commander in chief that he appears to be just playing the role on television. ""I want to add my voice to the many who have endorsed you to be our president,"" Clinton said. She added, in a nod to the coronavirus, that ""this is a moment where we need a leader, a president, like Joe Biden."" Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Biden called Clinton a ""friend"" and thanked her for the ""wonderful personal endorsement."" The former secretary of state's endorsement was a foregone conclusion -- she had said for months that she would back the eventual nominee -- but it remains a significant boost for Biden because Clinton still enjoys deep support from an array of Democratic voters. She won over 65 million votes four years ago and has proven to be a prolific fundraiser throughout her political career. But Clinton's endorsement also allows Republicans to dredge up every controversy and attack that they used against the 2016 Democratic nominee, something Republicans are eager to do as they look to recreate the strategy that led to President Donald Trump's victory. ""There is no greater concentration of Democrat establishment than Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton together,"" Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. ""President Trump beat her once and now he'll beat her chosen candidate."" Clinton is the latest top Democrat to back Biden, who after a sluggish start to the primary process saw his fortunes shift by dominating the South Carolina primary and notching a series of key wins on Super Tuesday. Former President Barack Obama, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders all endorsed Biden earlier this month. Clinton sat out the primary fight, telling interviewers repeatedly that she was paying attention to the nominating process from afar. ""I'm just watching and hoping that we nominate whoever is the strongest candidate to take out the current incumbent,"" Clinton said in March, before the field had largely cleared. ""That's the only thing that really matters at the end of the day."" But Clinton stepped up her praise of Biden after Super Tuesday, once the former vice president's only opponent was Bernie Sanders, a politician who Clinton has deep-seated animosity for after the Vermont senator stayed in the 2016 primary for months after his path to winning the nomination then was mostly closed. ""He has the experience,"" Clinton said of the former vice president. ""He knows what needs to be done, he can repair the damage that he would be inheriting."" Clinton endorsing Biden is a reversal of what happened to the duo in 2016, when Biden stepped aside and endorsed his former Senate colleague despite wanting to run himself. The decision partially stemmed from former President Barack Obama firmly getting behind Clinton, all but denying his running mate and vice president the chance to run for the job in 2016. The decision not to run back then has weighed on Biden, though. ""I regret it every day, but it was the right decision for my family and for me,"" Biden said in January 2016, noting the fact that his son, Beau, had died the prior year. ""And I plan on staying deeply involved."" Clinton and Biden share a common story: Both have deep ties to Scranton, Pennsylvania, where Biden was raised and Clinton would spend summers with her grandparents. When Biden endorsed Clinton in 2016, their first event was in the city, where the duo visited Biden's childhood home. Clinton recalled during Tuesday's event how, when she was secretary of state, they had a standing breakfast date once a week, where they would talk often about work but also about family and their lives. Clinton concluded her endorsement with a hope for Biden: ""I wish he were president right now."""
cnn|"(CNN)Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts endorsed Joe Biden Monday, saying the former vice president ""has the experience and judgment not just to win in November, but to lead our nation after he does."" Moulton, a three-term congressman, dropped out of the 2020 race in August and is now the second former 2020 presidential contender to back Biden. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio announced his support last year. ""There's no better preparation for the White House than the decades Joe Biden has spent serving the country, especially his eight years as vice president,"" Moulton said. ""Most importantly: Joe can win. Joe Biden will beat Donald Trump and unify our country after four years of the most reckless commander-in-chief in American history,"" he added. Moulton is a 41-year-old Marine veteran who focused heavily on national security and his military service during his presidential bid. He joins a group of veteran lawmakers backing the former vice president, including Reps. Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania. Moulton's endorsement comes seven days before the Iowa caucuses. By choosing Biden, Moulton opted not to endorse his home state senator, Elizabeth Warren. She has earned an endorsement from a former 2020 rival -- former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro. In his endorsement statement, Moulton said Biden was the first person to hold a rally for him in his 2014 congressional bid and describes him as a ""friend and mentor."" This story has been updated with additional information."
cnn|"Washington (CNN)""I feel like Black people, we're not asking for sympathy, we're not asking for charity -- we are just asking for equality."" That was the rapper Cardi B, speaking with presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden in an interview for the latest issue of Elle magazine. The two discussed a variety of issues: the coronavirus pandemic, health care, higher education, police brutality. But what was perhaps most illuminating about the conversation was what it might have revealed: that Biden doesn't intend to rely purely on his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, for the campaign's voter outreach efforts. He may well be an active participant in that work. The former vice president's team seems keenly aware that having Harris on the ticket matters not only because of her representational value but also because of the role she's ready to play in boosting voter turnout, specifically when it comes to Black voters. Talking last week with The 19th, Harris made clear that she prioritizes voter access, which in recent years has been threatened anew thanks to gerrymandering, voter ID laws, chaotic polling places and the Supreme Court's 2013 decision that defanged the Voting Rights Act of 1965. These hurdles disproportionately affect Black voters.  But if the Elle interview signaled anything, it was that we shouldn't expect to see Biden on the sidelines in the weeks and months ahead. ""The vote matters. That's why you keep talking to people about the need to vote. Your generation can own what happens in the next election. They can change things dramatically if they show up and vote,"" Biden said. ""Tell me what your fans are most concerned about."" Tell me what your fans are most concerned about. Cardi B's thumping fan base, which skews young and diverse (and less likely to vote), probably won't hand Biden the election. But Biden's attention to the rapper and her followers still stood out because it demonstrated his ambition to improve turnout among the very voters he'll need -- and who are often overlooked. What's more, unlike the Trump team, which tends to talk with White voters about what Black voters want, Biden spoke directly with the communities in question. It's unclear what, exactly, Biden's campaign strategy will look like in the homestretch of the general election. But it isn't a leap to assume that Black voters will take center stage. ""I want Black people to stop getting killed and no justice for it. I'm tired of it. I'm sick of it,"" Cardi B told Biden when he asked her about her main interests in the 2020 contest. The rapper also had some terse words for President Donald Trump. ""I have a whole list of things that I want our next president to do for us. But first, I just want Trump out,"" Cardi B said, echoing a sentiment shared by the majority of Black Americans. ""His mouth gets us in trouble so much. I don't want to be lied to -- we're dealing with a pandemic right now, and I just want answers."""
cnn|"Los Angeles (CNN)Joe Biden was standing on a stage above a blacktop basketball court just off Obama Boulevard as he watched his path to the Democratic nomination, dismissed just days ago, open up. The former vice president was racking up Super Tuesday victories over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in states where he'd never even campaigned. Black voters carried him in the South. Suburbanites had fallen in line behind him. Turnout was soaring past 2008 primary levels in some states -- and Biden was winning. ""People are talking about a revolution,"" Biden shouted in a thinly veiled jab at Sanders during a celebratory speech in the historically black Baldwin Hills/Crenshaw neighborhood. ""We started a movement. We've increased turnout. They turned out for us!"" Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Biden's comeback was inconceivable just a week ago. In interviews, Biden's aides and allies all point to his win in Saturday's primary in South Carolina as the tipping point that resuscitated Biden and remade the Democratic race. But, they say, it couldn't have proven so pivotal for Biden without a confluence of events -- each one unrelated and some entirely out of his control -- that had started 10 days earlier in Las Vegas. A rival's implosion in a debate in Las Vegas, an endorsement and some tough talk from an old friend in Charleston, a viral town hall moment and a message that had sharpened at exactly the right time solidified Biden's big win in South Carolina. And a raft of departures and endorsements afterward turned that win into rocket fuel. Bloomberg and Nevada In mid-February, Michael Bloomberg posed an existential threat to Biden's campaign. He had risen in national polls, eaten into the former vice president's lead with black voters and frozen donors who were reluctant to rescue a faltering campaign. He was skipping the first four states to vote, so the Democratic electorate hadn't yet weighed in on Bloomberg's candidacy. But on the last day possible, a poll was released that pushed Bloomberg past the Democratic National Committee's qualification thresholds for a debate in Nevada. Minutes into Bloomberg's first appearance on the debate stage, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren launched the attack that was the beginning of the end of the former New York mayor's hopes of winning the Democratic nomination. ""People who thought that Mayor Bloomberg potentially was the candidate the party could coalesce behind and were attracted by the idea of a candidate who had unlimited personal financial resources, unfortunately had to come face to face with the fact that like all the other candidates, he has his strengths and he has his weaknesses,"" said Anita Dunn, the top official on Biden's campaign. Days later, Biden would finish a distant second to Sanders in the Nevada caucuses. The results brought two things into focus: Sanders was on a roll, and Biden was as well-positioned as anyone else to stop him. ""Kind of a realization that, 'Holy crap, Bernie Sanders might be our nominee' -- I think that really just brought everything into focus for a lot of Democrats,"" said California Rep. Ami Bera, a Biden supporter. Bera is one of the leaders of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's program for lawmakers facing tough re-election races in 2020, and said he began hearing ""buyers' remorse"" from some of those lawmakers who had endorsed Bloomberg. South Carolina blowout The race shifted to South Carolina, where African-American voters would make up more than half the Democratic electorate. Older black voters are Biden's base -- his ""firewall,"" he said weeks earlier. And anything short of a win would be a campaign-ending disaster. At the beginning of the weeklong sprint to the South Carolina primary, Biden met privately with Rep. Jim Clyburn, the No. 3-ranking Democrat in the House and a long-time friend -- a conversation first reported by The Washington Post. Biden had already begun to narrow his message, scrapping some of the soliloquies on electability and the past and making a stronger moral case against President Donald Trump. He'd shown flashes of a sharper approach in New Hampshire, then delivered a well-received speech on gun violence in Las Vegas. Clyburn gave Biden blunt advice to show more fight and focus. Clyburn got through to Biden, and the former vice president told aides he was going to take the congressman's advice. ""It was, 'Jim Clyburn told me I need to be talking about these things, he gave me these suggestions, and I think he's right,'"" Dunn said. ""He shared it with us, and he basically said, 'He's right.'"" On Tuesday night in Charleston, Biden turned in what some analysts called his best debate performance yet. The next morning -- in a pivotal moment that proved decisive for huge numbers of voters in South Carolina -- Clyburn threw his weight behind his old friend, endorsing Biden in the strongest possible terms, telling reporters that his wife who died last fall had greatly admired Biden. ""I know Joe. We know Joe. But most importantly, Joe knows us,"" Clyburn said. Then, on Wednesday night, a CNN town hall brought one of the most moving moments of Biden's campaign. Biden spoke at length with a pastor whose wife was killed in the 2015 shooting at Mother Emanuel AME Church. Biden recalled returning to the church to attend a Sunday service, and that it helped him heal weeks after his son Beau had died of brain cancer. ""There's that famous phrase from Kierkegaard, 'Faith sees best in darkness,'"" Biden said in the town hall. ""It gives me some reason to have hope and purpose."" It became a viral moment: a well-timed reminder to Democrats of why they'd loved Biden. Meanwhile, in Texas, Beto O'Rourke saw a clip of the moment with Biden and the Rev. Anthony Thompson online. The former Texas congressman and one-time 2020 presidential candidate was on the road, campaigning for state legislative candidates, and hadn't decided who to vote for in the upcoming Texas primary until he watched the video. He sent it to his wife and said he thought Biden was ""the guy for us."" ""I just was struck by his ability to connect with that one person, and then with all of us, simultaneously,"" O'Rourke said. ""I feel that's what this country needs. We need to heal after a very divided time."" The stage was set. ""You had a very concentrated time when Democratic primary voters really saw the Joe Biden that they know, that they respected and loved as vice president and that ultimately they feel is the best person to take on Donald Trump,"" Dunn said. Biden hadn't fixed all the problems that dragged him to a fourth-place finish in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire -- but he'd caught all the breaks, and made some of his own, in the lead-up to the South Carolina primary. It was a blowout. Biden won by 28 percentage points. The margin of Biden's victory had blocked out his moderate rivals from making any inroads with African-American voters who made up Biden's base. It forced businessman Tom Steyer, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar to confront a bitter reality: There was no path for them to the Democratic nomination. Steyer dropped out that night. Buttigieg departed the race on Sunday. And Klobuchar exited Monday morning. Bloomberg, who'd skipped the first four states and would be on the ballot on Super Tuesday, remained, but Biden had sidelined all of his other moderate rivals -- just in time. Super Tuesday There was virtually no window for Biden to change his advertising or campaign tactics ahead of Super Tuesday. His campaign had planned a $2.2 million advertising push. Beyond that, though, he was riding pure momentum -- the win in South Carolina and the massive amount of media attention it had earned. But in the hours and days that followed South Carolina's results, that momentum continued to build. The money began pouring into Biden's nearly empty campaign coffers -- about $5 million per day on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, Biden said. So did the endorsements. Biden had barely contested Virginia, with just one field office and $233,000 in advertising there. But weekend endorsements from Sen. Tim Kaine, former Gov. Terry McAuliffe and several members of Congress led to a show-of-force rally Sunday night in Roanoke -- a united front from the Democratic establishment in a state that was suddenly wide open. ""I think a huge amount of this has been organic,"" Dunn said. ""Elected officials and people who have been watching the race and have been looking for moments of clarity on what the final shape of the race is going to look like got that in South Carolina."" The next day, Biden's former rivals made their moves. Buttigieg flew to Dallas for an event with Biden early Monday evening. Klobuchar was there to kick off a rally later Monday night. And O'Rourke was the closer, whipping up the Dallas crowd at the most raucous rally of Biden's campaign to date. Biden's campaign felt the swelling momentum. Aides who had previously hesitated to name states the former vice president would win on Super Tuesday were acknowledging that they saw the map of competitive states expanding. They tried to turn the Klobuchar endorsement into a late play for Minnesota, where Sanders was favored to win. Klobuchar cut a radio ad for Biden, and his campaign produced a television spot featuring her speech from the Dallas rally. Klobuchar's campaign also deployed its volunteers and organizers in a last-minute ground push for Biden. The tight window between Saturday's South Carolina primary and Tuesday's contests in 14 states left no time for polling -- so it wasn't clear how directly the endorsements and donations would translate into votes. The results were better than Biden's campaign ever could have hoped for. There were signs he'd picked up nearly all of the supporters of the candidates who had dropped out. According to exit polls, half the voters who made their minds up in the last few days voted for Biden. Biden had pulled off a close victory in Texas and swept the south. He'd won Virginia and romped in North Carolina, the southern state Sanders' campaign saw as its best shot. He'd won Minnesota. And -- in perhaps the biggest shocker of all -- he won Massachusetts, stealing Warren's home state. He also won Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee and Oklahoma. He'd won in five states where he hadn't even campaigned. Biden had reshaped the electorate, with suburbanites who'd made up their minds late joining African-Americans, older voters and loyal Democrats to form a Biden coalition. Wednesday morning, Bloomberg -- who has committed to spending from his vast personal fortune to defeat Trump -- dropped out and endorsed the former vice president. Biden has been here before. He was the national leader for most of 2019, but squandered his early advantages with a muddled message and a lagging organization. Political liabilities developed over more than four decades on the national stage and three runs for president won't be erased overnight. Allies acknowledged he has work to do with young voters and Latinos. But the former vice president is now in his best position in months. ""I think this is the day that the campaign got real and voters started looking in the race in the context of the problems American face,"" said Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, a Biden campaign co-chair. ""We are Team Amy, Team Beto, Team Pete, and Team You. And that's what I think voters are recognizing."""
abc|"President Joe Biden set a new goal for vaccinations in America, calling for 70% of the U.S. adult population to have at least one shot and 160 million Americans to be fully vaccinated by July 4 in remarks on Tuesday afternoon. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that, as of Tuesday, 105 million Americans are fully vaccinated, while 147 million have had at least one dose. ""That means giving close to 100 million shots -- some first shots, others' second shots -- over the next 60 days,"" Biden said. Over the past 60 days, about 153 million doses have been distributed, so the new goal would represent a significant slowdown. In the past, the administration has set goals that some public health experts have criticized as being low targets. Biden acknowledged in his remarks that, ""the pace of the vaccination is slowing,"" as many Americans have already been vaccinated -- though he added that it was anticipated by his administration. The president's plan focuses on three key demographics: children between the ages of 12 and 15, adults who have struggled with access to the vaccine and Americans who are ""less eager"" to get vaccinated. No vaccines have been greenlighted for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration for children, which Biden acknowledged. ""The FDA's scientists are currently reviewing the data to decide if and when to authorize that age range for vaccinations,"" Biden said. ""The FDA and the FDA alone will make that decision. But today, I want American parents to know that if that announcement comes, we're ready to immediately move to make about 20,000 pharmacy sites across the country ready to vaccinate those adolescents as soon as the FDA grants its okay."" Biden also touted the launch of a new government website, vaccines.gov, which he said is a ""simple website"" to help Americans find a place to get vaccinated. ""We know that many adults have not been vaccinated because they have found it too confusing or too difficult or too inconvenient to get a shot,"" Biden said. ""So for those having trouble finding a location or making an appointment, we're going to make it easier than ever."" Biden also talked about targeting Americans who might be hesitant to get vaccinated. He floated using incentives like working with sports teams for free tickets or discounts and stores to provide discounts to Americans who get vaccinated. Recent ABC News/Washington Post polling shows that still nearly one in four Americans are disinclined to get vaccinated, something Biden said could be remedied with more information from trusted sources. ""Talk to someone you trust like your physician or your pharmacist, or people who have already been vaccinated,"" Biden said. ""Talk to your faith leaders or others in your community that you trust. Look to those people to help answer your questions."" When asked by a reporter Tuesday whether this phase of vaccine outreach would be more difficult than earlier ones, Biden said that he thought it would be easier, given that in earlier phases vaccinations relied on the available supply. But he also said that convincing people is also going to be hard. ""We're gonna keep at it, and I think at the end of the day, most people will be convinced by the fact that their failure to get the vaccine may cause other people to get sick and maybe die,"" Biden said. Biden ended with an appeal for Americans to achieve the vaccine goal: A Fourth of July celebration. Particularly, an Independence Day where Americans could celebrate with small, fully vaccinated, maskless, outdoor picnics and barbecues. ""We need you,"" Biden said. ""We need you to bring it home. Get vaccinated. In two months, let's celebrate our independence as a nation and our independence from this virus. We can do this. We will do this"""
abc|"Despite an increasingly vocal chorus of condemnations from the Biden administration and U.S. lawmakers of both parties, El Salvador's president and his allies are pushing ahead with what critics call a power grab. The growing political crisis in the central American country presents a stark challenge for the U.S. government, especially Vice President Kamala Harris who President Joe Biden tapped to lead efforts at boosting the region, combatting poverty and corruption, and stemming migration to the U.S. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has not spoken to Harris -- even as she's called leaders in Guatemala and Mexico -- and the popular populist president has criticized the Biden administration's plans for the region. Despite Biden and Harris' talk of cooperation, Bukele's tightening grip on power is alarming U.S. officials, with Congress now raising calls for penalties like visa bans or restricting financing to El Salvador's government. ""Just this weekend, we learned that the Salvadoran parliament moved to undermine its nation's highest court. An independent judiciary is critical to a healthy democracy and a strong economy. On this front, on every front, we must respond,"" Harris said Tuesday. On Saturday, the country's legislature, known as the National Assembly, voted to dismiss all five judges on the Constitutional Court, as well as the attorney general, hours after its new members were sworn in. The body is now dominated by Bukele's New Ideas political party, who with its allies has an absolute majority after winning big in February's elections. The Constitutional Court, a top division of the country's Supreme Court, had repeatedly ruled that Bukele has exceeded his constitutional authorities during the coronavirus pandemic, while the attorney general had recently opened corruption cases into several of his ministers. Within hours of the legislature's vote to dismiss them, all were replaced by picks allied with Bukele. The Constitutional Court's sitting judges ruled the dismissals were done in an unconstitutional manner -- setting up a constitutional crisis that has been condemned by the U.S., the Organization of American States, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. ""Unfortunately, what we see in El Salvador is the deepening of an alarming trend towards the concentration of power. I remind all state authorities of the need to comply with their obligations under international law, to restore the rule of law and the separation of powers,"" said Michelle Bachelet, the U.N. envoy, on Tuesday. The Biden administration has similarly denounced the moves, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling Bukele directly on Sunday to express their ""grave concern."" But those efforts have been ignored -- demonstrating that the U.S. partnerships in the region that the Biden administration has touted are, at best, troubled. Wildly popular in his country and throughout the region, Bukele is consolidating power in precisely the way that Harris and others say they are working against. ""No matter how much effort we put in on curbing violence, on providing disaster relief, on tackling food insecurity -- on any of it -- we will not make significant progress if corruption in the region persists,"" Harris said Tuesday at the Washington Conference on the Americas. ""If corruption persists, history has told us, it will be one step forward and two steps back, and we know corruption causes government institutions to collapse from within, preventing people from getting their children educated, from getting a business started, from getting a fair trial."" But any entreaties to Bukele has so far been lukewarm. When Biden first unveiled his plans for the region, the young president, who tweets himself, wrote dismissively, ""A recycled plan that did not work in 2014 will not work now."" The administration has faced similar challenges with Juan Orlando Hernandez, the president of Honduras who has been accused in U.S. federal court of bribery and narcotrafficking. Harris has yet to call Hernandez, and when she makes her first overseas trip next month, she will visit Mexico and Guatemala, but skip Honduras and El Salvador. As she finished her remarks, Harris did not respond to a question from ABC News about whether developments in El Salvador would make it more difficult to work with the government there on migration. ""The actions by President Bukele and his allies in the Assembly make it clear that the Salvadoran government is not acting as a reliable ally in strengthening democratic institutions or governance and that the Biden Administration won't be able to cooperate with him and his government in addressing these problems,"" according to Adriana Beltran of the Washington Office on Latin America, a D.C. think tank. The administration has not said whether they agree with that. Asked if they are weighing punitive action, State Department deputy spokesperson Jalina Porter told ABC News she has ""nothing to read out, nothing to announce at this time."" In the meantime, Bukele has been celebrating the strength of his political party, which he founded in 2018. In a tweet after midnight on Tuesday, he said he was ""proud"" of the party, adding, ""Our country has a great future with young people like this (and a couple not so young),"" with a crying laughing emoji. In the face of the international outcry, including from the U.S., he also tweeted on Sunday to ""our friends in the International Community... with all respect, we are cleaning our house... and that's none of your business."" But there's rising anger in the U.S. Congress that may make it America's business. Top lawmakers from both parties have urged Biden and Blinken to penalize Bukele's government, including by imposing U.S. visa bans on senior officials or restricting financial support through institutions like the International Monetary Fund. Sen. Bob Menendez and Patrick Leahy, both top Democrats, warned the Salvadoran National Assembly in a statement Monday ""to immediately reverse this anti-democratic power grab and avoid any weakening of our bilateral relations at this consequential moment for the region."" ABC News' Sarah Kolinovsky and Ben Gittleson contributed to this report from the White House."
abc|"LONDON -- The Indian delegation at the G-7 meetings in the U.K. will not be in face-to-face meetings after ""exposure to possible COVID positive cases,"" the Indian Foreign Minister said, although officials said the summit itself is not at risk. ""Was made aware yesterday evening of exposure to possible Covid positive cases,"" Dr. Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India's Minister of External Affairs, posted on Twitter. ""As a measure of abundant caution and also out of consideration for others, I decided to conduct my engagements in the virtual mode. That will be the case with the G7 Meeting today as well."" Although the Indian delegation has not yet attended the G-7 meeting of foreign ministers at Lancaster House in London, they did meet with their U.S. counterparts on Monday. It is not yet clear whether any of the attendees in that meeting had tested positive. ""The U.S. delegation was advised, including by the U.K.'s public health professionals, that our stringent masking, social distancing, and daily testing protocols would permit us to continue with our G-7 activities as planned,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement. ""We have no reason to believe any of our delegation is at risk. We will continue to follow the guidance of public health professionals going forward and abide by the same strict COVID-19 protocols."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was pictured alongside Jaishankar on Monday, has been vaccinated against COVID-19. Other delegates will not be asked to self-isolate as officials said that strict social distancing was observed. Attendees to the summit are tested daily, although at the Monday meeting between Blinken and Jaishankar, delegates did take off their masks while divided by sheets of plexiglass. Anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 would be required to self-isolate in line with U.K. government guidelines. ""We deeply regret that Foreign Minister Dr. Jaishankar will be unable to attend the meeting today in person and will now attend virtually, but this is exactly why we have put in place strict Covid protocols and daily testing,"" a senior U.K. diplomat said. While not formally a member of the G-7, India was invited to attend a series of meetings between the foreign ministers of G-7 countries in London this week. A dozen countries have delegations at this week's meetings ahead of the G-7, which President Joe Biden hopes to attend with other world leaders, in the U.K. in June. The withdrawal from face-to-face meetings will be a serious blow to the proceedings, which promised to be the first in-person G-7 meetings in two years."
abc|"A bomb exploded near a school in Farah, in western Afghanistan on Monday and wounded 21 people. At least 10 of those injured were students as young as 7, a provincial official said. No group has immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but the Taliban are active in the area, according to the Associated Press. The attack comes two days after the U.S. began withdrawing the remaining 2,500 to 3,500 troops from Afghanistan, following President Joe Biden's plan to be out of the country by Sept. 11 at the latest. In the last two days there have been almost 300 Taliban attacks in more than two dozen provinces across Afghanistan, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense. Former defense minister Tamin Asey told ABC News that the Taliban have not changed, as many fear the group's violent resurgence amid troop withdrawal. ""The ideology haven't changed. Their global claim to jihad haven't changed. They are more confident of their victory and they think that they have defeated the United States and NATO,"" Asey said. Top U.S. military officer General Austin Miller, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces, warned the Taliban that they'll respond forcefully to any type of attack, according to the Associated Press."
abc|"Ahead of President Joe Biden""s first foreign trip to the United Kingdom for a G-7 summit in June, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in London this week for the first face-to-face-meetings of G-7 foreign ministers in two years. While the international entourages are limited and strict COVID-testing protocols are required, the gathering, beginning Tuesday, shows an eagerness among member nations to return to in-person diplomacy and get to work on major issues in a post-COVID world. Around the formal G7 conference table, Blinken and his counterparts have removed their masks, but they are separated by plexiglass dividers. These G-7 meetings with friendly allies will provide a low stakes but high-profile opportunity for Biden""s team to visibly reappear on the world stage, as the president has liked to talk about, and evaluate the country""s position after four years of former President Donald Trump""s ""America First"" doctrine. In his first 100 days in office, Biden has emphasized that he sees an urgent need to mend relationships with allies that were complicated and strained under Trump and he has reentered global institutions his predecessor abandoned. Biden's push for increased multilateralism, however, comes at an awkward time when so many citizens around the globe are still experiencing physical isolationism in the face of a global pandemic. While the G-7 nations have applauded their information-sharing and collaborative work fighting the virus, each country has handled the health care crisis very differently and vaccine manufacturing and distribution are still extremely inequitable. Beyond the pandemic, however, many Americans see the global community as having a fairly poor track record in solving global crises. From the fight against climate change, where emissions are far exceeding goals meant to reduce them, to wars in Syria and Yemen; the recent buildup of Russian troops on Ukraine""s eastern border and allegations of human rights and trade violations by China -- the list of emergencies facing and frustrating the G-7 leaders has only grown. Back home, both Blinken and Biden have a tough job ahead of them and will likely have to continue to make the case to skeptical Americans that multilateralism is worth the time. ""Not a single one of those challenges can be effectively met by any one country acting alone -- even the United States, even the United Kingdom. There is, I think, a stronger imperative that at any time since I've been involved in these issues to find ways for countries to cooperate, coordinate, to collaborate. That's the way we advance the interests of our citizens,"" Blinken said at a joint news conference with U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab Monday. The Biden administration""s argument is that U.S. leadership has been lacking and that international crises still require international cooperation. Much of the agenda for this G-7 is structured around threats and competition from Russia and China. In the last few weeks, Biden has redoubled his focus on China, pitching his domestic agenda as a necessary step for competing with country and calling out Beijing for bad behavior. On Friday, the Biden administration specifically said China had failed to keep commitments to protect American intellectual property as outlined in their recent trade deal. ""It is not our purpose to try to contain China or to hold China down. What we are trying to do is to uphold the international rules-based order that our countries have invested so much in over so many decades,"" Blinken said Monday. ""When any country, China or otherwise, takes actions that challenge or undermine or seek to erode that rules-based order and not make good on the commitments that they've made to that order, we will we will stand up and defend the order."" Several nations outside of the G-7 were invited to attend events and meetings this week, including South Korea, India, Australia and Brunei, which is chairing the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Blinken conducted bilateral meetings with most of those visiting delegations Monday. The teams sat across from each other at long tables in cavernous and otherwise empty hotel conference rooms. ""They're all key partners for us. I think they're also a sign of the greater focus on the Indo-Pacific region, as the economic and strategic crucible for this century,"" Secretary Raab said at Monday's news conference. Prior to the meetings this week, the Group of Seven wealthy industrialized nations also announced they planned to jointly invest $15 billion ""in development finance over the next two years to help women in developing countries access jobs, build resilient businesses and respond to the devastating economic impacts of COVID-19."" The international work on girls"" empowerment feels especially poignant at the moment with U.S. and NATO withdrawing of troops from Afghanistan this summer, causing many human rights experts to worry about the future of Afghan women in civil society should the Taliban increase their power there. Many of the G-7 countries supported the United States' Afghanistan coalition and have lost their own troops in the war that has lasted nearly 20 years. This trip to London is Blinken""s first as secretary of state and the U.K.""s first G-7 meeting since Brexit. Blinken did meet with Raab during a NATO meeting in Brussels in late March. During their news conference Monday, the two secretaries talked liberally about their shared values, mutual agreement on foreign policy and close-knit cooperation. ""I think it's fair to say the Biden administration is barely 100 days old, but has already taken a huge number of bold and very welcomed steps on issues like climate change, global health and human rights. And that's really created momentum in efforts to tackle these pressing global issues,"" Raab said. When asked if the U.K. felt snubbed by America's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, he demurred. In turn, when Raab was asked how the U.K. could lead on the global stage when it had decided dramatically recently to cut international aid, Blinken complimented the U.K. on its humanitarian work. ""The U.K. is our most vital partner including working around the world, in helping other countries, helping people fulfill their potential and deal with some of the challenges that have been brought on by many things but including by COVID-19 … we share a commitment to and conviction about the importance of doing development work in different ways and amplifying, as Dominic said, both our respective contributions as well as bringing others along,"" Blinken said."
abc|"The TAKE with Rick Klein President Joe Biden wants and needs Americans to listen to public-health experts on COVID-19. He'll talk about vaccines Tuesday afternoon, but the people he most needs to reach right now are among the least likely to listen to him or the experts he's citing. Prominent Republicans not only know that, but appear to be seeking political advantage out of those facts. Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis has now ended all local COVID-19 restrictions and mandates in his state, arguing that that's ""the evidence-based thing to do."" The way-too-early 2024 contender added a twist: If you think government needs to be ""policing people at this point,"" DeSantis said, ""then you're really saying you don't believe in the vaccines."" That just might be a dig at Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Last week, the decision to hold the president's speech before Congress in a sparsely attended and fully masked setting -- with an audience of mostly vaccinated adults -- drew commentary about counter-productive messaging. But suggesting that Democrats don't believe in vaccines because they're advocating mask-wearing? It's Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who is questioning why vaccinated individuals should ""care if your neighbor has one or not,"" and it's Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is advising Biden to ""burn his mask"" in public -- after months of sharply questioning whether masks matter at all. The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, is attacking Biden for continuing to wear a mask outside, calling that ""unscientific."" The RNC is simultaneously fundraising off of skepticism of Dr. Anthony Fauci, with an appeal promising to ""always hold government officials like Dr. Fauci accountable for giving conflicting statements."" The politics of the vaccination push has been caught up in intraparty sniping, including critiques of Biden for not fully recognizing former President Donald Trump's role in vaccine development. But with vaccination rates slowing and herd-immunity timelines slipping, convincing the vaccine-hesitant population amounts to an enormous challenge -- one bigger than party-line divisions for the nation and unlikely to be tackled in Biden's speech Tuesday. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Divisions within the Republican Party were on full display Monday with Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., speaking out against Trump. After Trump issued a statement aimed at whitewashing the term ""the big lie,"" used to refer to the misinformation campaign waged by Trump and his supporters to cast doubt on the outcome of November's election, Cheney took to Twitter. ""The 2020 presidential election was not stolen,"" Cheney wrote. ""Anyone who claims it was is spreading THE BIG LIE, turning their back on the rule of law, and poisoning our democratic system."" Trump shot back with a statement calling her a ""big-shot warmonger"" and saying that Wyomingites ""never liked her much."" Support for Cheney within Republican ranks has dwindled since she spoke out against Trump in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 attacks on the Capitol and voted in favor of Trump's subsequent impeachment. And in February, standing with House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Steve Scalise, the second-ranking House Republican, she said of Trump, ""I don't believe that he should be playing a role in the future of the party or the country."" Cheney's steadfastness has put her on shaky ground within the party. She could be ousted from Republican House leadership and down the line, if Trump-backed efforts to challenge her succeed, she could lose her seat all together. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema The nation's next showdown over state voting rights has been brewing in Texas over the last month and it could come to a head as early as this week. In the lead up to what is expected to be a contentious floor vote in the House, on Monday, voting rights and criminal justice organizations, including the Texas American Civil Liberties Union and the Texas Anti Defamation League, sent a letter to Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, and Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan voicing their ""opposition to bills criminalizing voting activities."" ""Election offenses are extremely rare, and unlawful activities that alter the outcomes of elections are even rarer in modern history. Voter suppression, on the other hand, is extremely common and disparately impacts voters of color, voters with disabilities, and first-time voters,"" the letter said. The move comes after Republicans on the House Election Committee voted last week to replace the language of the Texas Senate's voting bill, SB 7, with that of the House's legislation, HB 6. Although that development opens the door for potential intraparty divisions over which bill's language is ultimately enacted, in broader terms, it also showed that the GOP-backed push to revise the state's voting parameters are set to be included in the final weeks of the Texas legislative session.

abc|"The TAKE with Rick Klein Facebook may have made it easy for itself, as these things go. Wednesday marks judgment day for the platform's relationship with former President Donald Trump, with the decision on whether he should be reinstated resting with its oversight board. The Republican Party can't make up its mind on Trump that cleanly or decisively. That's making fights the GOP hoped to leave in the past urgent in the present -- particularly as it becomes clear that most Republican voters and elected office-holders don't want Trump gone at all. Republicans can blame Trump and his refusal to accept the fact of his defeat, on top of his apparent inability to leave a possible fight unfought. But really, they should be blaming themselves. The trouble Rep. Liz Cheney finds herself in again with her conference is because of decisions her colleagues have made and are making about what constitutes acceptable behavior in a Republican leader while Trump is well out of office and, for him, relatively muted. It may be that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., essentially sealed Cheney's fate with his hot-mic take: ""I've had it with her. You know, I've lost confidence."" McCarthy was central in shielding Cheney, R-Wyo., from removal from leadership after her vote to impeach Trump. But Cheney is simply continuing to say what she has said for months now -- that Trump lost and that his actions leading up to and on Jan. 6 constituted a ""betrayal"" that should not be forgotten. The stakes for the GOP are about more than who the third-ranking member of House leadership is. It's about whether Republicans of any stature should be allowed to call out Trump for his lies -- or have any opinions about his future role in the party that don't align with MAGA-world. All of this brings a new urgency to Facebook's decision, which will be announced by its independent oversight board at 9 a.m. ET. Consider the influence Trump is having without Facebook or Twitter, where his ban has been labeled as permanent. The former president has been churning out short statements of late, and now has launched a new website to connect with supporters. One can only imagine what Trump's sway inside his party might be like when he starts holding rallies again, and when he uses platforms both old and new to get his message out. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper The Biden administration is moving into a new phase of pandemic response as both COVID-19 cases and demand for vaccines dip across the country. In remarks Tuesday, President Joe Biden aimed to address vaccine hesitancy among Republicans by extending an olive branch of sorts -- offering credit to the Trump administration for authorizing the vaccines and gratitude to GOP lawmakers who have spoken up on the efficacy and safety of vaccines. ""Science behind the vaccines has been under development for decades. While we may not always agree on everything, this is one thing people across the political spectrum can agree on,"" said Biden. ""So I want to thank prominent conservatives like Mitch McConnell and a large group of Republican members of Congress who have -- who have medical training, who have advanced getting vaccinated."" But niceties likely won't be enough to persuade the hesitant to take the shots. Nearly 1 in 4 Americans are disinclined to get the vaccine and 16% have ruled out getting the vaccine entirely, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll. According to the same poll, that thinking is highest among rural residents, Republicans, conservatives and those with no more than a high school diploma. Administering more vaccines will be vital to reaching Biden's goal of a return to normalcy, or something close to it, by July 4. The TIP with Meg Cunningham As Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis looks ahead to 2024, Democrats at home are setting their sights on his spot in the governor's mansion. Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist, a former Republican who was governor from 2007 to 2011, made his run official Tuesday. But another prominent Democrat, Rep. Val Demings, could be preparing to make an announcement of her own. She tweeted a campaign video hours before Crist's announcement with the caption ""ready for the moment."" She's even pinned the tweet at the top of her Twitter page. Demings was in the mix as a potential vice president to Biden and has been public about her desire to hold statewide office, either in the Senate or as governor. ""I have received calls and texts and messages from people all over the state, asking me to run because they feel that they are not represented, and their voices are not heard,"" she said on MSNBC in April. Despite trying, Crist hasn't had statewide success in a decade. Though Florida may be an uphill battle for Democrats, Demings would make history if she won either race -- Florida has never had a Black governor or a Black U.S. senator.

abc|"President Joe Biden's new benchmark in the fight against COVID-19 -- ensuring 70% of American adults to get at least one shot by July 4 -- seems to be a tacit acknowledgement of what scientists have been saying now for months: Eradicating the virus that causes COVID-19 might not be possible. But if enough Americans get some protection, it'll become manageable. That approach is being embraced by scientists and politicians alike as a considerably more pragmatic approach to dealing with COVID-19 than the idea of waiting on ""herd immunity,"" especially considering that a fourth of Americans might never accept the vaccine. ""We're going to have highs and lows of case numbers potentially for years, but those are going to be in the population that chooses not to vaccinate,"" said New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu in a phone interview Tuesday. Since the pandemic began, Americans have embraced the idea that the virus would one day evaporate, either because enough people became infected with the virus or received a vaccine. That collective, or ""herd,"" immunity would block the virus from transmitting to new people, eradicating the threat. The idea was so alluring that some top advisers to President Donald Trump called for allowing younger people to get sick with the virus so it would go away sooner and businesses could reopen without restrictions. Trump, who last fall jumbled his reference to the term as ""herd mentality,"" predicted that ""with a vaccine, I think it will go away very quickly."" By January, five days after taking office, Biden said he was ""confident that by summer we're going to be well on our way to heading toward herd immunity."" And by March, Biden said herd immunity was a prerequisite to giving up masks. ""We've got to reach the point where we have herd immunity -- meaning where we have a vast majority of the American people have been vaccinated -- before we can stop wearing these,"" Biden said this spring, holding up his mask. Since then, however, the U.S. vaccine rollout has slowed considerably with only 32% of the population fully immunized. Big federally run vaccination sites are closing up shop in favor of smaller mobile vans that reach people in rural and other hard-to-reach neighborhoods. And for the first time, some states this week were expected to decline portions of the vaccine doses available. Administration officials told governors in a weekly phone call Tuesday that because some states were expected to leave behind supply, other states can now ask for added doses if they want it. The sudden slowdown so early in the rollout of vaccinations has health officials warning that eradication of the virus might not be possible. Another concern is that potentially dangerous global variants could form overseas that threaten the efficacy of the vaccines. Health officials have already predicted that booster shots will probably be needed for years. ""Eradication was never in the cards … COVID is with us for the indefinite future,"" said Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""That doesn't mean that the pandemic is with us. We can end the pandemic,"" he said, noting the U.S. could manage smaller isolated outbreaks in ways it can't with the current level of 50,000 some infections a day. Biden seemed to acknowledge as much in his remarks Tuesday. ""Well, I'd like to get it 100%,"" he said of the vaccination rate. ""But I think, realistically, we can get to (70%) between now and July 4th."" Scientists said the concept of herd immunity has always been nuanced and a difficult threshold to pinpoint. Although often taken to mean total eradication of the virus, herd immunity can also be defined around more manageable goals, such as dramatically slowing down transmission. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, had initially estimated that roughly 70-85% of a population must become immune to the virus for it to go away, but he's since backed away from the number. In a private phone call Tuesday between the nation's governors and the White House, Fauci tried to steer state officials away from any estimate because he said no one knows what the magic number would be. ""The one thing … that we absolutely know for sure is that as you get more and more people vaccinated, the number of cases are going to come down and down and down. So our goal is just get as many people as you can possibly get vaccinated, and don't get hung up on this elusive concept of a number that nobody really knows what that number is,"" Fauci told the governors. According to a senior administration official, Biden's new benchmark was less about doing away with any notion of herd immunity and more about setting ""a collective goal for the country"" now that the president's first 100 days in office had passed. But Biden's 70% figure of vaccinated adults also appears to be a nod to the ""tipping point"" in COVID cases that health experts and state officials have witnessed on the ground. That's the point at which hospitalizations and death rates plummet after enough people are vaccinated. In New Hampshire, for example, more than 60% of adults already have the first dose, making it one of a few states with the highest vaccination rates and inching close to Biden's goal of 70%. Sununu, a Republican, said he sees that as a success. ""We're there,"" Sununu said when asked what success might look like in the pandemic. ""I don't mean to like sugarcoat it but … our economy is booming. And everyone who wants one of the vaccines has it."" Dr. Paul Goepfert, professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Director of the Alabama Vaccine Research Center, said he thinks the ""ultimate definition of success"" would be hospitalizations and deaths similar to that of the seasonal flu or lower. Annual flu deaths are estimated to go as high as 60,000 in a year. Dr. Paul Offit, the director of vaccine education and physician of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said one benchmark could be how the country fares next fall. If fewer than 50 people die every day of COVID by next November through January -- a period of time you'd expect to see deaths peak -- that could be considered a success, he said. ""If we have an adequate level of population immunity, then we will only have a small bump (in cases) over the winter. If on the other hand we don't, then we will again see a surge next winter,"" Offit said. Frieden said new, potentially more dangerous variants of the virus developing overseas remain the wildcard. Introduction of such a variant could change that equation for any state with large pockets of unvaccinated people. That's why getting as many people vaccinated as possible has to remain the goal. ""I understand that people want clarity,"" Frieden said. ""But the reality is that there's a lot we don't know. And if people tell you with great certainty that they know, they don't know what they are talking about."" ABC News' Sony Salzman, Katherine Faulders and Cheyenne Haslett contributed to this report."
abc|"House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Tuesday a growing number of Republicans in the conference are taking issue with Rep. Liz Cheney and he signaled that her days as GOP Conference chair -- the third-ranking Republican in the House -- could be numbered. ""I have heard from members concerned about her ability to carry out the job as conference chair, to carry out the message. We all need to be working as one if we're able to win the majority,"" McCarthy said on Fox News. While he did not explicitly state what her future will be within the party, all signals point to another possible vote to oust her from her position as conference chair. ""I haven't heard members concerned about her vote on impeachment, it's more concerned about the job ability to do and what's our best step forward that we can all work together instead of attacking one another,"" he said. Cheney's team was quick to respond. ""This is about whether the Republican Party is going to perpetuate lies about the 2020 election and attempt to whitewash what happened on Jan 6. Liz will not do that. That is the issue,"" Cheney spokesman Jeremy Adler said in a statement provided to ABC News. The latest battle in Cheney's political war with President Donald Trump over the election came Monday when Trump put out a statement saying, ""The Fraudulent Presidential Election of 2020 will be, from this day forth, known as THE BIG LIE!"" ""The 2020 presidential election was not stolen,"" Cheney tweeted not long after. ""Anyone who claims it was is spreading THE BIG LIE, turning their back on the rule of law, and poisoning our democratic system."" Cheney rebuked Trump again on Monday at a closed-door conference in Georgia, where a spokesman confirmed she called Trump""s false election fraud claims ""a poison in the bloodstream of our democracy."" The earliest Republicans could hold a vote on Cheney's leadership position is next Wednesday during a weekly Republican conference meeting, though sources have signaled a vote could take place before the end of the month. Republicans are considering another woman to replace Cheney, sources familiar with the deliberations told ABC News. Some of those names under consideration are Reps. Elise Stefanik, Anne Wagner and Jackie Walorski, the sources said. Axios was first to report their names. A spokesperson for Wagner declined to comment. Spokespeople for Stefanik and Walorski did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Stefanik has emerged as the apparent front-runner should Cheney be ousted, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News. A prominent ally and defender of Trump, Stefanik has been working the phones with her team in a bid for Cheney's spot, sources said. Following the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, the Dean of Harvard University's Kennedy School announced Stefanik was removed from the advisory board of Harvard's institute of politics after her ""public assertions about voter fraud in November's presidential election that have no basis in evidence, and she has made public statements about court actions related to the election that are incorrect."" GOP Rep. Jim Banks is also being considered, per a source. The Indiana Republican heads the Republican Study Committee. ABC News has reached out to Banks' office for comment. The optics of replacing Cheney, the only woman in House Republican leadership, with a white male, would certainly raise some eyebrows at a time when the Republican Party is trying to engage more women and minorities in politics. Frustration is growing among Republican lawmakers at the continued feud and Cheney's seeming inability to step away from the political battlefield. ""GOP members want to focus on the agenda. We have energy issues we want to focus on, and this isn't helping at all,"" one GOP aide said of the broader intra-party fight. As a conference chair, Cheney's role is to maintain focus on the party's message, and not necessarily her own, having some in the party admitting she could very well be in jeopardy of losing her leadership post. ""She's there telling the truth, but she needs to think about how effective she is able to be if she's constantly choosing to engage opposite Trump which puts her opposite most of the conference. If she can't develop some message discipline, then what is the point in her retaining the job,"" another Republican aide told ABC News. In a secret ballot in February, Republicans voted 145-61 to keep her in the No. 3 position, despite her vote to impeach Trump for his alleged role in inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection. McCarthy, who at the time was criticized by colleagues for his shifting statements about Trump""s responsibility for the storming of the U.S. Capitol, endorsed Cheney and encouraged Republicans to keep her on the leadership team. Now, it appears McCarthy is not as confident in Cheney""s role in leadership as he looks to take back the House in 2022 and win back favor with the former president. McCarthy, when asked last week about Cheney""s future, refused to answer when asked whether she remained a good fit as the conference chair. Members of McCarthy's team have begun whipping votes against Cheney. Cheney has taken heat from other Republicans for statements she has made in recent weeks and months to direct the Republican Party away from Trump. Trump, in return, has vowed to back a primary challenge to Cheney in her statewide district in Wyoming. In February, Cheney told reporters that Trump ""does not have a role as a leader of our party going forward."" Last week, she said it is ""disqualifying"" for any public official who opposed certifying the election results to run for the White House in the future. At the Republican retreat in Orlando last month, Cheney said that she believes Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and McCarthy are the heads of the Republican Party and suggested that the GOP can win back the House, Senate and White House in the next elections by conveying to voters that they are a party of ""competence and of conservative principles"" and by winning back voters they lost in 2020, making subtle digs against the former president without naming him. One Republican official with knowledge of the matter told ABC News that Cheney is unlikely to lose McConnell""s support, given there""s no need for him to weigh in on the matter. McConnell also has a longstanding relationship with the Cheneys. Just last week, conservatives criticized Cheney for fist-bumping President Joe Biden as he walked into the House chamber to deliver his address to a joint session of Congress."
abc|"President Joe Biden's spending is ""like someone with a new credit card,"" Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week,"" signaling difficulty ahead for the expansive presidential agenda laid out in the past week, but also pointing to potential successes in terms of what GOP leaders may compromise on going forward. ""And these are things that we don't necessarily need -- we certainly can't afford -- but they're going to delight the liberal left of the party,"" Barrasso, the leader of the Senate Republican conference, told ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz of Biden's spending bills. So far, Biden counted a success on his nearly $2 trillion coronavirus plan, while working toward Congressional compromise on his $2 trillion infrastructure proposal and his $1.8 trillion American Families plan. ""Ultimately, someone's going to have to pay for this. It's almost creating an addiction to spending,"" he added. Barrasso also told Raddatz that Democrats are privately becoming apprehensive about the price tag of Biden's plans. ""I will tell you, Democrats are also getting concerned more about the call of this spending and borrowing, realizing that they're going to be held accountable in the 2022 election. And some Democrats -- publicly, but mostly privately -- are saying this isn't sustainable,"" he said. Raddatz pointed to a plan introduced by West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore-Capito in late April, which significantly trimmed down the price tag to $568 billion and focuses exclusively on ""core"" infrastructure items like roads and bridges, broadband, airports, waterways, rails, ports and public transit. It excludes some big-ticket items in Biden's proposal, including explicit funding for electric vehicles, housing and home care. In criticizing the Biden proposal, Barrasso cited a figure used by Republicans in recent weeks that says Biden's proposal only allocates 6% overall to roads and bridges. But Raddatz pushed back, saying it has been fact-checked as false. ""The total amount for what you would call 'traditional infrastructure,' roads, bridges, rails, airports, waterways, public transit, is more than 25% of the Biden plan. So do you want more?"" she asked. Barrasso said he believes a compromise can be made if some aspects of the plan are left behind. ""I've been working regularly with the other Joe -- powerful Joe -- in Washington, Joe Manchin,"" he said. ""So I actually believe there's a deal to be had if we leave out things like the Green New Deal and recyclable cafeteria trays and climate justice, because $500 to $600 billion of infrastructure is a massive amount of infrastructure."" A new ABC News/Ipsos poll out Sunday morning found that 67% of Americans feel that Republicans in Congress are not doing enough to work with the Biden administration. Citing the poll, Raddatz asked Barrasso, ""So are there places where you could compromise on the president's agenda, where you see a good opportunity to meet him and Democrats in the middle?"" ""Republicans went to the White House to meet with him on another coronavirus package, and we made really good faith efforts, he ignored all of it. They did this through budget reconciliation, by the slimmest margin of votes and ignored Republicans,"" Barrasso said. ""We want to work together with this administration."""
ny_post|"Joe Biden wonders whether Barack Obama is qualified to be commander-in-chief. ""Mark my words,"" Biden warned Sunday at a Democratic fund-raiser. ""It will not be six months after the inauguration before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy."" Then he added, ""Watch. We""re going to have an international crisis, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this guy."" Now, here""s where it gets scary. Obama""s ""gonna need your help to use your influence within the community to stand with him. Because it""s not gonna be apparent initially, it""s not gonna be apparent that we""re right."" He""s going to need help? Terrific. What""s particularly disturbing is Biden""s Kennedy analogy. For those who don""t recall, it was a scant five months after JFK became president that Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev took his measure. Kennedy had just bungled the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba, then went off to a summit in Vienna – where Khruschev determined that the rookie chief executive could be had. Two months later, construction began on the Berlin Wall, precipitating a crisis that nearly led to a US-Soviet shooting war in Europe. And 14 months after that came the Cuban Missile Crisis – when nuclear Armageddon was only barely averted. Is Biden saying that America""s current enemies – sorely aware of Obama""s inexperience – plan to test a President Obama with similar crises, to see what he""s made of? Sure seems like it. But what if Obama is still on the wrong side of the learning curve when this major international crisis hits? More important: What if he makes the wrong decision – as even Joe Biden suggests he might? After all, Obama was wrong about the troop surge in Iraq. And he was wrong in his initial response to Russia""s invasion of Georgia – when he urged the victimized nation to ""show restraint."" And he was wrong when he said he would gladly sit down unconditionally with people like Hugo Chavez and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad – the very people his own running-mate now says are planning to ""test"" him. As John McCain said yesterday, ""We don""t want a president who invites testing from the world . . . The next president won""t have time."" Little wonder, then, that Biden later admitted that he ""probably shouldn""t have said all this."" But why not, Joe? It""s doubtless all true. And it""s much better to get it all out now – rather than wait until it""s too late to do anything about it."
ny_post|"Historian: Joe Biden""s Toughest Opponent Is Joe Biden It would probably be a lot easier for Joe Biden if he were a Republican, suggests Jeff Greenfield at Politico.

Unfortunately for Biden, ""it""s not at all clear that Democrats, especially this year, view the past with such forbearance."" Today""s Democrats have ""hard questions to ask"" about some of his past positions and actions.

Yet it probably ""asks too much of voters to put themselves into a past that is utterly alien to them."" Foreign desk: Trump Tries ""Strategic Patience"" in Korea The Trump administration is holding firm to its all-or-nothing bid for a grand bargain with North Korea""s Kim Jong Un — a position The Washington Post""s Josh Rogin calls ""a form of strategic patience, to give Kim one last chance to make the right decision."" Strategic patience, of course, is ""a loaded term,"" because that""s how Team Trump ""derisively refers to the Obama administration""s North Korea policy — no real negotiations and no intentional escalation."" At the recent Hanoi summit, Trump offered Kim his ""big deal"": total denuclearization in return for economic normalization. Kim instead opted for a ""small deal"": ""limited denuclearization in exchange for broad sanctions relief."" So Trump walked, and now we""re in stalemate (though without nuclear or missile testing by Pyongyang). Eventually, though, Trump""s strategic patience will run out.

This month, the Hungarian Parliament enacted a sweeping new pro-natal law that includes mortgage reductions for second and third children. Plus, ""effective in 2020, mothers with four or more children will enjoy a lifetime personal-tax exemption."" Pecknold argues: ""Hungary is proving that pro-family policies are better for nations than those policies which deracinate and diminish the family."" — Compiled by Eric Fettmann and Sohrab Ahmari"
ny_post|"Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden was backtracking big-time yesterday over suggestions that an Obama-Biden administration might someday bring criminal charges against President Bush. ""I don""t know where that report is coming from,"" said the Delaware senator. Why, from Joe Biden is where. Speaking in Deerfield Beach, Fla., this week, he was asked whether ""you guys are going to pursue the violations that have been made against our Constitution by the present administration."" Biden""s reply: ""Yes."" He then added, ""We will not be ""estopped"" from pursuing any criminal offenses that occurred"" during the Bush years. ""If there has been a basis upon which you can pursue someone for a criminal violation, they will be pursued."" Correcting for Biden""s bizarre speaking style, this sounds pretty clear-cut: Bush-Cheney are looking at hard time. What about Obama? Last April, when asked about investigating ""high crimes in the White House,"" he said he would ""have my justice Department and my attorney general immediately review the information that""s already there and to find out if there are inquiries that need to be pursued."" In other words, maybe. Whether either man really means it, or whether they""re trying to keep their party""s moonbat base happy, isn""t clear. So let us be clear here. We know that the loony left has been aching for a Bush-Cheney frog-march into the jailhouse since Jan. 20, 2001. But criminalizing policy differences – which is what Obama-Biden seems to be talking about it – is how they conduct politics in Third World banana republics. Jail to the chief? Why not just promise to line up the outgoing administration against a wall and start shooting? Biden needs to watch his mouth. Obama, too."

ny_post|"It takes years of yoga to learn the posture necessary for speaking clearly with all your feet in your mouth. But for some the skill comes naturally, which brings us to Joe Biden. Those who saw Dick Cheney as an evil genius crouched silent in the shadows of the Oval Office like Nosferatu must enjoy Biden""s high profile: he""s out there daily with the sunny enthusiasm of Ronald McDonald opening another store. And, quite often, telling everyone to have a Whopper. The ""gaffes,"" as we call unscripted thoughts, come delightfully often with Biden. The latest: Speaking before the AARP, Biden aarped up a peculiar formulation to explain the need to borrow 3.2 bejillion dollars in order to transform the American health care system, preferably by next week. He said people ask him ""What are you talking about, you""re telling me we have to go spend money to keep from going bankrupt? The answer is yes, ""I""m telling you.'"" In Vietnam-era terms: we have to burn the hospital in order to save it. Even if that means losing the burn unit. In one sense, Biden""s logic isn""t new; anyone who said we had to partition Iraq to save it is perfectly capable of believing we have to dig a deep hole now to keep from falling into a deeper hole later. But how does this fit with Biden""s other summer misstatements? Let""s take a quick review. Iran. Earlier this month George Stephanopoulos asked Biden if the US would stand in the way of Israel decided it was time to take out Iran""s nuke program. Said the Veep: ""We cannot dictate to another sovereign nation what they can and cannot do … if they make a determination that they""re existentially threatened and their survival is threatened by another country."" True. But wrong! The sensible thing is to say: ""We are seriously concerned about Iran""s nuclear ambitions, and strongly support serious efforts to be concerned, in coordination with allies whose serious efforts are concerned with — hey, is that a mushroom cloud on CNN? Turn the sound up."" Everyone knows Iran will give up the bomb, but in their own way: by putting it on a rocket and waving safe journey, Allah-speed. As the saying goes: If you love something, set it free. If the US isn""t going to stop them, shouldn""t Israel have the right to? But that""s not the official line, so YANK went the collar. Administration officials explained that the Vice President was using secret reverse-talking, and the allies remain committed to a sustained effort to frown and grip the podium while hoping there""s no follow-up questions. Swine Flu. Should we panic? ""I would tell members of my family — and I have — I wouldn""t go anywhere in confined places now,"" Biden said, adding, ""When one person sneezes, it goes all the way through the aircraft."" This statement was so true it was retracted by the end of the day. When the experts — i.e., cable-news reporters on the medical beat — start talking about Pig-Pandemic bringing down human civilization, everyone""s first reaction is to stay away from planes and trains. But a Leader is supposed to say something calming, like ""if you""re taking a flight full of feverish travelers back from Cancun, don""t lick the tray tables."" The Economy. Also in early July, Biden said ""We misread how bad the economy was."" This one is a bit different to explain away, since the administration billed itself as having super-genius comprehension of the problem and the necessary solutions. Now, many suspect, President Obama finds himself staring at a portrait of FDR, murmuring ""Help me, Obi-Wan. You""re my only hope."" What Biden meant to say, in his puckish way, that they misunderstood what an economy is, and how it works. Piling up a mountain of proposed taxes, mandates, regulations, do-nothing programs and pork unseen in such dimensions since Pink Floyd floated a dirigible pig over an outdoor concert might, in fact, prevent recovery. So do not criticize him; applaud his palaver, and hope for more. Biden""s ""gaffes"" are anything but — they""re simply what the administration is really thinking. Truer words have never been babbled."
ny_post|"Joe Biden""s public repudiation of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos"" new Title IX regulations wasn""t the normal criticism by a challenger against an incumbent administration. After several days during which the ex-veep and his media allies celebrated the importance of due process in evaluating sexual-assault allegations, Biden denounced DeVos"" own efforts to ensure that accused college students receive fair procedures. The hypocrisy was striking. The new regulations undid an Obama-era initiative in which Biden was the key player. Convinced that male students typically stood by as they saw ""a brother taking a drunk freshman coed up the stairs to his room,"" Biden oversaw a multiyear effort to use Title IX tribunals to ""change the culture"" on campus. Due process, the rights of the accused or the possibility of false allegations appeared in no public speeches that he gave on the topic; indeed, the concepts were obstacles to his goal. Too many not-guilty findings wouldn""t produce the needed change. Then came Tara Reade, who charges that then-Sen. Biden, her former boss, sexually assaulted her 27 years ago. Reade""s claim has many weaknesses, but it""s nevertheless weighty enough to yield a guilty finding from a Title IX tribunal under the procedures and standards of evidence Biden championed. Biden has now urged the public to evaluate Reade""s allegations under traditional rules, respecting the presumption of his innocence. Reade, Biden maintains, should face rigorous questioning rather than enjoying the benefit of the reflexive belief that he had offered to campus accusers. Facing what he claims is a false allegation, Biden might have used the DeVos regulations to acknowledge that college students deserve the same opportunity to defend their innocence he is getting. The new regulations, requiring colleges to provide both the accused and the accusing students with all the evidence compiled in an investigation, and then to hold a hearing in which advocates for both students can cross-examine witnesses, hardly encompass a radical vision of due process. Biden didn""t rise to the occasion. Instead, he wildly claimed that the regulations would ""shame and silence"" campus complainants and ""strip survivors of their rights"" — as if Title IX, an equity statute, gives accusers the right to convene a kangaroo court to adjudicate their allegations. He promised to restore the Obama-era policies that created the due-process crisis on the nation""s campuses, even though implementing those procedures in 2021 would require at least some colleges to ignore appeals-court holdings from lawsuits filed by accused students. There is more Biden hypocrisy where that came from. The DeVos regulations require investigation of allegations of quid-pro-quo harassment by staff or faculty, as well as of rape, sexual assault, stalking, domestic violence and dating violence. They also require investigation of claims of sexual harassment as defined by the Supreme Court""s most important Title IX case, Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education. Biden, however, apparently sees a Title IX process focused on such serious offenses as a negative, allowing colleges ""to choose to investigate only more extreme acts of violence and harassment,"" ignoring allegations of less extreme offenses. This is an odd line of argument for someone who has admitted to making women uncomfortable by touching them in public, albeit without ill intent. Surely, Biden wouldn""t support harsh punishment for a college student who engaged in behavior identical to his? If Biden is oblivious to the absurdity of his demanding procedural protections that he intends to deny to college students facing similar allegations, other Democrats seem more self-aware. None has endorsed the DeVos regulations, but in sharp contrast with 2018, when the education secretary released a preliminary version of the new campus rules, only a few congressional Democrats have publicly criticized her work this time around. Before the presidential campaign gets into full swing, perhaps a reporter could ask Biden to reconcile his response to Reade with his attack on the due-process protections in DeVos"" regulations. How can a college student facing a false allegation defend himself effectively under the Title IX procedures that Biden would re-impose on the nation""s campuses? And how would Biden defend himself against Tara Reade""s allegations, if he were held to those same standards? KC Johnson is a professor of history at Brooklyn College and the CUNY Graduate Center.

The host is a professional clown. The VIP guest is a political clown with more baggage than the Kardashians during Paris fashion week. Setting aside the past plagiarism, fabulism, K Street cronyism, chronic gaffes and the stagnant aroma of 4-decades-old Beltway entrenchment, though, Biden""s two biggest cultural liabilities currently on the table (and everywhere else) are his grabby paws: Groper One and Groper Two. Seriously, those two troublesome tentacles need to be wrapped in yellow caution tape and stamped with a trigger warning. Joe""s yuck factor is no joke. Political observers of all stripes balked earlier this year at photos of the creep veep wrapping himself around the wife of Defense Secretary Ashton Carter — and nearly nibbling off her ear while he deep-massaged her shoulders. Poor Mrs. Carter, helpless in front of the cameras as her husband spoke just inches away, exhibited the body language of a shell-shocked hostage. She""s not alone.

The Internet meme magic that helped propel Barack Obama to millennial icon status threatens to sabotage his sidling sidekick. I can report on Biden""s cozy relations with trial lawyers, bankers and lobbyists ""til I""m blue in the face. But none of that sticks in the minds of average voters as much as the indelible impression of instability and ickiness he has left across social media: Margaret Coons, the 13-year-old daughter of Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), grimaced when the coarse whisperer nuzzled up to her at her dad""s swearing-in ceremony.

If liberals are looking for an alternative to the sordid grotesqueries of the Clinton years, they""ll need to look harder.

On college campuses, militant feminists partition off ""safe spaces"" to protect women from male menaces.

ny_post|Beau Biden, a son of Vice President Joe Biden, has been hospitalized at Walter Reed Army Medical Center outside Washington. Biden, 46, a former Delaware attorney general, is undergoing treatment at the facility. No further details were available. After eight years as attorney general, Biden joined the investor law firm Grant & Eisenhofer in 2015. He served a yearlong tour in Iraq as a captain in the Delaware Army National Guard and underwent surgery at a cancer center in Texas last year. He suffered a mild stroke in 2010. In a message to voters posted on his website in April 2014, Biden, a Democrat like his father, said he planned to run for governor.
cbs|"The next step in President Biden's large-scale economic plan is infrastructure, and he'll be unveiling the first piece of a two-part package on Wednesday in Pittsburgh — where he launched his 2020 presidential campaign. The White House told senators in a call on Tuesday that the plan will cost $2 trillion over eight years, sources familiar with the call told CBS News. There will be four major areas of spending: transportation, water/electricity/broadband, care and innovation. Transportation includes electric vehicles, highway, public transit; water/electricity/broadband will include replacing lead pipes and grid updates and innovation will include semiconductors, batteries and research. The proposal pairs traditional forms of infrastructure with vital services. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that Mr. Biden's Pennsylvania address would focus on roads, railways and domestic manufacturing. Psaki added that Mr. Biden will turn to the second part — which includes health care, child care and education — in April. ""The president has a plan to fix the infrastructure of our country,"" Psaki said. ""We are currently 13th in the world. No one believes we should be there, and he has a plan to pay for it, which he will propose."" Psaki told reporters that the administration is open to listening to members of Congress offer their proposals on how to pay for the plan, which has been reported to be as high as $3 trillion. She hinted that reforming the tax code could raise revenue to pay for the plan. ""He, of course, believes that investing in our infrastructure, continuing to create good-paying union jobs is front and center,"" Psaki added. ""But he also believes that we have an opportunity to rebalance to take, to address our tax code that is out of date. And some could pay more in our country that are not currently."" Garnering support from Republicans in Congress will be difficult, especially after Democrats, in passing the $1.9 trillion COVID stimulus package, used the budget reconciliation process to circumvent the 60-vote threshold required for most Senate legislation and instead passed the bill with a simple party-line majority vote. Asked about the possibility that the White House would try to split the economic recovery package into two parts to win Republican support on infrastructure, Senate Minority Whip John Thune told reporters last week that Senate Republicans wouldn't support that ""ploy."" ""If they want to sit down with Republicans, which they should, the Republicans would work with them on an infrastructure package,"" Thune said Tuesday. He added, ""But if they decide to do that as a ploy to lure Republicans in to vote for the easy stuff and then do all that stuff, the controversial stuff through reconciliation, I don't think our guys are going to take the bait on that."" It's not just Republicans Mr. Biden must win over. Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia says  he wants to see Republican input, so that the Senate won't have to rely on reconciliation to pass. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said last week that he believes the American people know infrastructure needs to be done ""in a new green way"" and hopes Republicans will work on the package. But Schumer added that if the parties cannot work together, Democrats would ""move forward."" Independent Senator Bernie Sanders, the chairman of the Senate Budget committee, has said he is prepared to use reconciliation to move an infrastructure package through the Senate. The use of reconciliation is vetted by the Senate parliamentarian, and Schumer's policy aides are making the argument that a section of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 allows Democrats to use reconciliation again this fiscal year, but a Schumer aide said that the legislative strategy has not yet been finalized. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said at a press conference Monday that he doesn't want to see tax increases ""across the board on America."" ""My advice to the administration is if you want to do an infrastructure bill, let's do an infrastructure bill,"" McConnell said. ""Let's don't turn it into a massive effort to raise taxes on businesses and individuals."" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pitched House members in a hearing last week on big investments in infrastructure, telling them that this is ""the best chance in any of our lifetimes to make a generational investment in infrastructure."" House Republicans, however, still favor a narrower bill. ""A transportation bill, I think, needs to be a transportation bill, not a Green New Deal,"" Republican Congressman Sam Graves, the ranking member on the House Transportation and Infrastructure committee, told Buttigieg last week. ""It needs to be about roads and bridges."""
cbs|"President Biden delivered remarks on Friday to celebrate 50 years of service by Amtrak, arguing that expanding and investing in the country's passenger rail system would help the economy by creating jobs and benefit the environment by cutting down on fossil fuel emissions from commuters. ""Amtrak doesn't just carry us from one place to another, it opens up enormous opportunities,"" Mr. Biden said. He also reiterated that expanding passenger rail service would mean the creation of union jobs. Mr. Biden's remarks came as he continues to promote his multi-trillion dollar legislative agenda. His infrastructure and jobs proposal, the $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan, would invest $621 billion in improving transportation infrastructure such as roads, bridges and public transit, including $80 billion dedicated specifically to Amtrak. The president proposed expanding rail service across the country, suggesting more routes that stretch from the midwest to the coasts. ""It's going to provide jobs, and it will also accommodate jobs,"" Mr. Biden said, claiming that making towns and cities Amtrak stops would help revitalize them economically. ""There's so much we can do. And it has an incredibly positive impact on the environment. It has an incredibly positive impact on work."" A group of Republican senators have also introduced their own $538 billion infrastructure proposal. This plan would only dedicate $20 billion to the rail service. Amtrak has estimated that it has a $31 billion repair backlog just for trains in the Northeast Corridor. Mr. Biden earned a reputation for frequently riding Amtrak from Delaware to Washington, D.C. while he was a senator, and continued using the railway as vice president, inspiring the moniker ""Amtrak Joe."" In his speech, Mr. Biden repeatedly referred to Amtrak workers as ""family,"" and promised to fight for a ""bright future for all American rail."" Mr. Biden continued to use the railway system during the 2020 presidential campaign, and intended to travel via Amtrak from Delaware to Washington on the day of his inauguration in January. However, these plans were scrubbed after the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6. The president was introduced on Friday by a conductor who worked his regular route, and Amtrak officials also spoke. ""This is a birthday I certainly wouldn't miss,"" he tweeted on Friday. ""Looking forward to celebrating Amtrak's 50th in Philadelphia later today."" This week, Mr. Biden marked his first 100 days in office with a speech at a rally in Atlanta. On Wednesday, he delivered his first address before a joint session of Congress, outlining the American Jobs Plan as well as his $1.8 trillion American Families Plan focused on health care, child care and education."
npr|"President Biden on Tuesday is set to announce new steps to reach rural Americans in the push to get as many people as possible vaccinated for the coronavirus, a White House official tells NPR. This emphasis comes as rural hospitals are raising alarms about the pace of vaccination — even among their own employees. The Biden administration is moving into a new phase of its vaccination campaign, one where it knows doctors and health care professionals are often more persuasive than the government. It has prioritized a list of doctors enrolled in the vaccine system based on a ""social vulnerability index"" used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — including doctors in many rural communities — and has been asking state government to send vaccine doses to those doctors, the official said. The administration also plans to work with states to enroll more pediatricians and family doctors in their vaccine systems so they can begin giving people vaccines, a step that becomes ""particularly critical"" if the Food and Drug Administration gives emergency authorization for adolescents ages 12-15 to start getting the Pfizer vaccine, the official said. The administration also is working with provider groups to encourage their members to sign up to give the vaccines and will be providing technical assistance to help practices get ready for vaccination, the official said. ""Tremendously problematic"" The new steps come as some rural hospitals are finding that their own staff members are reluctant to get the shot. A new survey conducted by the National Rural Health Association and Chartis Center for Rural Health showed that 30% of the 160 rural hospital executives who responded said less than half of their employees had been vaccinated — even though health care workers have been eligible for months now. Only about a third said that 70% or more of their staff were vaccinated. ""These survey results match what we are hearing from our members and that is tremendously problematic,"" said Alan Morgan, chief executive of the National Rural Health Association. ""At a federal level, every effort to overcome vaccine hesitancy has health care professionals front and center,"" Morgan said. ""So if you've got a quarter of the nation's rural hospitals having less than 50% of their staff vaccinated, you have a problem that needs to be fixed now."" This survey also lines up with a poll done earlier this year by the Kaiser Family Foundation and The Washington Post that found 29% of health care workers in rural areas didn't plan to get the COVID-19 vaccine. That's a greater well of hesitancy than the poll found among health care workers in urban and suburban areas. Michael Topchik at Chartis said the hospitals they work with have high vaccination rates every year for the flu shot. It's required. ""We were surprised at how many rural hospitals were telling us their vaccination rates for COVID-19 were significantly lower,"" Topchik said. ""It's too early"" In Carrollton, Mo., Jeff Tindle, the chief executive at Carroll County Memorial Hospital, is beside himself about the low rate of vaccination among his staff. Only 59% are vaccinated for COVID-19 and at this point he doesn't have much hope of that number growing dramatically. Tindle, who describes himself as conservative, like most people in his town, said he had assumed that health care workers would understand the importance of the vaccine. ""I'm disappointed that we built in so many safeguards ... first and foremost to protect our employees, and yet we had almost 40% who chose not to help themselves,"" he said. The hospital had a vaccine clinic but shut it down, turning its attention to helping the public health department. Most of the people who wanted to get vaccinated in the town of 4,000 have already done so, he said. ""We're worried about always wasting vaccine because we just don't have enough arms,"" he said. Talking to friends, Tindle says some have told him they are afraid of being implanted with microchips, a false conspiracy theory alive and well on the internet. ""Employees that I talk to, health care employees, will be a little more rational in their irrational behavior by saying, 'Well Jeff, we don't have enough studies. It's too early,' "" he said. ""I know that swayed people"" Some rural hospitals have had better luck getting employees vaccinated. Memorial Hospital in New Hampshire's Mount Washington Valley region is currently at 78%. Will Owen, who is running the hospital's community vaccination clinic, said education was key. In December, a highly respected local physician named Victor Lazaron sent a letter to staff. ""I am keen to be vaccinated as soon as possible,"" Lazaron said in the letter. He cited studies showing vaccines were effective and that the worst side effects were comparable to the vaccine for shingles, which is widely used. ""I hope you all will choose to be vaccinated as soon as the vaccine is available to you. In my judgment it is the best way forward. It is safe and effective. And it will help us get back to our core mission: protecting the health of our friends and neighbors in the Mount Washington Valley,"" Lazaron wrote. That letter opened people's minds to the vaccine, Owen said. ""I know that letter swayed people, because I had people tell me that,"" he said. There were also Zoom sessions for staff, led by doctors, leaving plenty of time for questions. Having trusted doctors and nurses vaccinated has been reassuring to others in the broader community, said chief nursing officer Kris Dascoulias, whose roots in the community are so deep that she was born in Memorial Hospital, where she now works. ""I've gotten lots of text messages, questions. I think people relied on the hospital community that they knew and trusted to guide them a little bit in this,"" Dascoulias said. She said she has encouraged people, telling them, ""I know it's a little scary, it's a little bit of a leap of faith, but you know it's better than the alternatives."" White House looks to local doctors The White House knows that doctors and other trusted local leaders will be the way to break through pockets of hesitancy in rural communities, said Bechara Choucair, the White House vaccinations coordinator. Choucair also pointed to a different Kaiser Family Foundation poll that found a majority of rural residents had been vaccinated or planned to get vaccinated, although it also shows a much smaller share of urban and suburban residents would ""definitely not"" get the shot than those in rural areas. ""Luckily we know that the overwhelming majority of health care providers are very supportive of the vaccine. Ninety percent of doctors and master's-prepared nurses have either gotten the vaccine or are in the process of getting vaccinated,"" Choucair told NPR, citing national data about doctors and highly trained nurses. ""We need to do that across the board for health care professionals and non-health care professionals and will continue to do that,"" he said."
npr|"The presidential inauguration ceremony on Wednesday looked a lot different than in previous years. Masks were a reminder of a pandemic still raging. The ceremonial parade was canceled and some customs went virtual. In a historically rare snub, a sitting President Trump was absent for the swearing-in ceremony of his successor, Joe Biden. But, at least for the sartorially minded, an abundance of strategically selected outfits helped elevate an unusual and scaled-back ceremony. There were repurposed woolen mittens, elaborate face masks and dramatic collars. Over on social media, amateur fashion sleuths looked on, attaching symbolism and pronouncing the emergence of new clothing aesthetics. Bright color choices told their own stories and paid tribute to leaders past. There was Amanda Gorman, the youngest inaugural poet in history, who captivated the country with the reading of her poem, ""The Hill We Climb."" In a vibrant canary yellow Miuccia Prada coat, a red satin Prada headband and a red mask to match, the 22-year-old stood out in a sea of muted tones and indistinguishable suits. The yellow, Gorman told Vogue, was her way of paying homage to first lady Jill Biden. The first lady asked Gorman to recite an original poem at her husband's swearing-in last month after she was moved by Gorman's reading of her poem, ""In This Place: An American Lyric,"" in 2017 at the Library of Congress. Gorman told the magazine: Jill Biden said, ""I saw this video of you and you were wearing yellow and I loved it."" The poet also wore gold hoops and a ring in the shape of a caged bird, a present from Oprah Winfrey as a tribute to Maya Angelou and her poem, ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings."" Lady Gaga, a pop star synonymous with drama, belted out the national anthem in custom Schiaparelli haute couture: a fitted navy jacket and a billowy red silk skirt. Washington Post humor columnist Alexandra Petri thought Gaga's severe attire might as well have been plucked from a Hunger Games movie. With an unmissable golden dove brooch pinned to her chest, though, the avant-garde shapeshifter insists she was sending a message of peace to a divided nation: ""A dove carrying an olive branch,"" Gaga tweeted. ""May we all make peace with each other."" Jennifer Lopez followed co-headliner Lady Gaga in a Victorian chic look (Pride and Prejudice, but make it glam). J.Lo's all-white Chanel ensemble featured a ruffled blouse buttoned to the top of her neck. Her pants, loose and sequined, contrasted with the rigidity of her tweed coat. Looks aside, Twitter users collectively lost their minds when the performer summoned a sampling of her 1999 hit, ""Let's Get Loud,"" during her rendition of ""This Land Is Your Land."" Ella Emhoff, stepdaughter to Vice President Harris, turned out in full 20-something art-student-from-Brooklyn glory (or so some social media users observed). She arrived at the Capitol wearing a dramatic tweed coat from Miu Miu adorned with a frilly oversized collar. Underneath was a Batsheva dress — reminiscent of the prairie-chic style dominating Instagram Explore pages. Emhoff's stylists, Jill Lincoln and Jordan Johnson, completed the look with chunky black boots and a thin hairband. Appearing to hold down his socially distanced 6-foot perimeter, Bernie Sanders gave onlookers an unobstructed view of his take on ""grumpy chic."" The Vermont senator's understated look stood out among the formal-clad masses. Staying loyal to his Green Mountain State roots, he wore a hefty parka from Burton, a Vermont-based snowboarding brand. As astute Tweeters noted, Sanders wore the same coat in a now famous ""I am once again asking"" meme that originated from a video in which he asks for donations back when he was on the campaign trail. Burton Snowboards took it as an opportunity to offer fans a Bernie-inspired budget-friendly look. It was also hard to overlook the senator's repurposed sweater-wool mittens — gifted to him a couple of years ago by Jen Ellis, a teacher in Vermont, a backstory noted by Buzzfeed reporter Ruby Cramer. Despite all appearances, his inauguration presence was not a pit stop on an errand run, as some on Twitter suggested. Where Sanders comes from, he told CBS in an interview following the ceremony, ""We're not so concerned about good fashion — we want to keep warm. And that's what I did today."" Similarly, Janet Yellen prioritized comfort over fashion in freezing-cold temps. The former chair of the Federal Reserve, and Biden's pick for Treasury secretary, was nestled inside of her black puffer jacket. She draped a blue blanket over her knees for added toastiness. Biden's granddaughters arrived at the Capitol looking like an all-woman supergroup, according to several Twitter users who said they thought the pop rock-band Haim arrived to perform at the inauguration. They were decked out in monochromatic outfits, down to their masks and gloves. Plus, the combination of pink, camel and white struck some as the human embodiment of Neapolitan ice cream. Not least of all, Vice President Harris made history while outfitted in a bold purple coat and matching dress by Christopher John Rogers, a young Black designer who hails from Louisiana. CNN journalist Abby Phillip remarked that purple is a special color to Harris as a ""nod to Shirley Chisholm,"" the first Black woman elected to Congress and whom the vice president has cited as inspiration for her political career. It's also a color of the women's suffrage movement, as NPR reported. Opting for a plum pantsuit, former first lady Michelle Obama, too, stuck to the color theme that, as a blend of colors red and blue, has also traditionally signaled bipartisanship or unity. Farah Eltohamy is an intern on NPR's Digital News desk. A maskless President Biden addressed the nation Wednesday night standing at the feet of Abraham Lincoln Memorial during a televised and star-studded celebration of the historic inauguration. ""We're good people,"" he reassured viewers, before picking up the theme of his earlier speech on the steps of the Capitol. ""Unity forces us to come together in common love that defines us as Americans,"" Biden said. The 46th president urged the public to come together, saying it's ""the only way we'll get through the darkness around us."" He noted that the obstacles facing the nation — including the pandemic currently ravaging communities across the country, racial injustices and the climate crisis — are ""threats to our very democracy."" ""Will we meet the moment like our forbearers have?"" Biden asked. ""I believe we must and I believe we will,"" he said. ""You, the American people are the reason why I have never been more optimistic about America than I am this very day."" He added: ""America is built of decency and dignity of love and healing of greatness and goodness. Of possibility."" The inaugural program, called Celebrating America, featured several tributes to the extraordinary efforts by nurses, doctors, teachers and other frontline workers who have stepped up throughout the coronavirus pandemic. In her first remarks to the nation as vice president, Kamala Harris echoed the president's call to unite in the days ahead. ""In many ways this moment embodies our character as nation,"" she said in a brief address to the audience. ""Even in dark times, we not only dream, we do. We shoot for the moon and then we plant our flag on it,"" Harris said. ""We are bold, we are fearless and ambitious. We are undaunted in our believe that we shall overcome that we will rise up."" She added: ""A great experiment takes great determination. The will to do the work and then the wisdom to keep refining, keep tinkering, keep perfecting."" Although much of the program hit several somber notes, the two-hour show was interspersed with several performances by a variety of singers, musicians, artists and actors. Among them, John Legend sang Nina Simone's Feeling Good. Justin Timberlake and Ant Clemons performed Better Days. Puerto Rican singers Ozuna and Luis Fonsi sang their respective mega-hits, Taki Taki and Despacito, in Spanish. And Katy Perry's Firework, served as the soundtrack to a stunning firework show over the White House and the National Mall that capped off the celebration. The Senate has voted to confirm Avril Haines to be director of national intelligence, making her President Biden's first Cabinet-level official to receive Senate confirmation. The vote was 84-10. Her confirmation comes after Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., briefly held up the process, asking for a written response from her about a question during her confirmation hearing a day earlier. ""I no longer object,"" Cotton said Wednesday evening, noting that Haines had provided him with a response. ""In her open session yesterday, she gave an answer in response to Sen. Ron Wyden that suggested the intelligence community might reopen investigations into detention interrogation programs from 2001 to 2006,"" Cotton said. ""She clarified in the private setting that she had no intention to open up those investigations and expose operations officers inside the CIA to criminal prosecution, or adverse employment action, or even holding it against them in potential future promotions or placements."" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., had tweeted earlier Wednesday that he wasn't attending Biden's inauguration to work to expedite a vote on Haines' nomination. ""It's important we do this as soon as possible,"" he wrote. Haines' confirmation prevents a situation where Biden would begin his presidency with no members of his national security team firmly in place, as is customary. During her Tuesday confirmation hearing, Haines began her opening statement with tacit criticism of President Trump. ""When it comes to intelligence, there is simply no place for politics, ever,"" she said. She pledged to declassify an intelligence report about the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and promised an ""aggressive response"" to China to counter its ""illegal and unfair practices."" Haines, 51, previously was deputy national security adviser. She also was deputy chief counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2007-2008 when Biden was chairman. In 2013, President Barack Obama named her deputy CIA director, the first woman to hold the job. She now makes history again as the first woman to hold the top job in U.S. intelligence. When Biden announced Haines in November as his pick to lead the intelligence community, she vowed to ""speak truth to power."" ""I've worked for you for a long time, and I accept this nomination knowing that you would never want me to do otherwise and that you value the perspective of the intelligence community,"" she said at the time. ""And that you will do so even when what I have to say may be inconvenient or difficult, and I assure you, there will be those times."" President Biden's initial wave of planned executive actions includes an order to reexamine one controversial, but widely used, pesticide called chlorpyrifos. The Trump administration had stepped in to keep the chemical on the market after Obama-era officials tried to ban it. It's just one in a long list of science-related Trump administration actions that the incoming Biden team will now revisit. In a statement, Biden promised to take a close look at all policies ""that were harmful to public health, damaging to the environment, unsupported by the best available science, or otherwise not in the national interest."" Farmers use chlorpyrifos to control insects on a wide variety of crops, including corn, apples, and vegetables. It is among the most toxic pesticides. Workers exposed to it can experience dizziness, headaches, and nausea. Most indoor uses of the pesticide were halted in 2001. More recently, however, researchers at Columbia University studied health records from women who'd been exposed to this chemical before that ban, and found evidence that exposure to tiny amounts of chlorpyrifos harmed the brains of their developing fetuses and young children. Those studies, along with lawsuits filed by environmental advocates, convinced the Environmental Protection Agency to move ahead with a ban during the final months of the Obama administration. When the Trump administration took office in 2017, the new EPA leadership put that decision on hold and later reversed it. This was due in large part to the agency's decision to exclude evidence from the Columbia University studies, because university researchers refused to turn over raw data from those studies. The researchers maintain that this would violate the confidentiality of the women whom they'd studied. California, meanwhile, moved ahead with its own regulations. It banned sales of chlorpyrifos in the state in early 2020. Starting this year, California's farmers no longer can spray the chemical. The Biden administration now will take a fresh look at chlorpyrifos, as well as the EPA's rules that justified excluding the Columbia University studies. In addition, the incoming administration will revisit a Trump administration decision to shrink the buffer zones around fields that have to be free of people when pesticides are applied. Farmworker advocates have challenged that decision in court. Updated at 8:23 p.m. ET The Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all hit new records as markets closed on Wednesday afternoon. The achievement was notched right in the middle of Inauguration Day celebrations, as the Biden administration played a montage of dancing and singing across America. There just may have been some celebratory shimmies on Wall Street, too. The Dow rose nearly 1% to 31,188. The tech-heavy NASDAQ closing nearly 2% higher at 13,457, while the broader S&P 500 rose 1.39% to end the day at about 3,852. The stock market has been surging for months, despite the economic anguish caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The Nasdaq has more than doubled since its pandemic low point back in March. Overall, stock market performance was very strong during the Trump presidency — annualized returns were almost as high as they were during the Obama administration. (Under President Bill Clinton, stock values soared even more.) More than any other president, Trump pointed to stock markets gains as his own personal success, although he did not seem to consider stock market losses in the same light. He repeatedly warned that a Biden win would cause markets to crash. A market crash is never out of the question, and some analysts worry we're in or approaching a bubble. But so far, Biden's win has not sent investors into a tailspin. Instead, many on Wall Street seem to believe that the veteran politician, famous for striking legislative deals, can work with Congress to push significantly more stimulus spending, which could boost stocks even higher. Of course, stock markets respond to many forces outside a chief executive's control, and neither Trump nor Biden can take full credit for the stock markets recent rise. Updated 5:45pm Eastern Time In one of his first acts in the Oval Office, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to have the United States rejoin the Paris climate agreement, the largest international effort to curb global warming. The U.S. officially withdrew from the accord to limit climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions late last year, after President Donald Trump began the process in 2017. It is the only country of the nearly 200 signatories that has withdrawn. Biden vowed to sign on Inauguration Day the documents needed to rejoin the agreement. The U.S. played a large role in creating the 2015 agreement. It aims to avoid the most catastrophic climate change scenarios by keeping average global temperatures from rising no more than 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably less than 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100, compared to pre-industrial times. Global temperatures have already increased by a little more than one degree Celsius. ""The window for meaningful action is now very narrow – we have no time to waste,"" said Dr. M. Sanjayan, chief executive of Conservation International, an environmental advocacy group. ""President Biden's action today is certainly a step in the right direction."" It will take 30 days for the U.S. to officially rejoin the agreement, but meeting its targets is going to be a taller order. The U.S. is the second-largest producer of carbon emissions, behind China, and has contributed more to global climate change over time than any other country. As a candidate, Biden made a bold pledge to cut all greenhouse gas emissions from the nation's electric sector by 2035 and to make the country carbon-neutral by 2050. Carbon emissions have been decreasing from the country's electricity sector as coal plants have been retired over the last decade and utilities ramp up their reliance on renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Industrial and transportation sources of carbon emissions are going to be harder to curtail. In 2017, transportation overtook electricity generation as the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. Biden is expected to stiffen auto emissions standards, but writing new rules takes time. Still, Biden's move to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement signals to the world that the U.S. is serious about addressing climate change again, and that it will have a seat at the table when world leaders meet in Glasgow to make new climate pledges later this year. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres welcomed the American re-entry into the climate agreement. In an emailed statement, he wrote: ""We look forward to the leadership of United States in accelerating global efforts towards net zero."" They gathered long distance via Zoom, garlanded with pearls in homage to Kamala Harris's signature neckwear, and with champagne bottles ready to pop. Eight Black women, who for the past 25 years have belonged to what they call the Brown Girls Book Club, could not miss the opportunity to join together for this historic moment: the inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, who becomes the first woman, first African American, and first Asian American vice president. ""I need this moment for me,"" said Vivian Wallace-Llodra, 50, a senior content strategist with JP Morgan Chase in New York, who sported a T-shirt reading ""Kamala and Joe"" (because ""first, her!"" she explained) and a cobalt blue pantsuit in tribute to Hillary Clinton. ""What's that song, 'It's been a long time coming?' "" Wallace-Llodra asked. ""Change gonna come! "" chimed in Rachel Giordani, 49, an instructional coach in New York, proudly decked out in a red Howard University sweatshirt. Many of those in the group are alumnae of Howard, Harris's alma mater, or fellow members of her sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, and they felt a special connection to this day. As they waited for the ceremony to begin, the women said the joy they felt was shaded by the damage done during the Trump presidency. ""I feel like today and in the days that are coming, we're all going to be recovering from PTSD,"" said Wallace-Llodra. ""Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is a return to normalcy."" The group turned euphoric when former first lady Michelle Obama appeared on the stage in a belted burgundy ensemble, her hair in a sleek, wavy blowout. ""Go ahead, Michelle!"" they shouted. ""Look at Shelly!"" ""Today we fierce!"" ""That's a helluva belt buckle!"" ""Forget it, she snacks from head to toe!"" When Harris emerged from the Capitol in a royal purple coat and matching dress, the women erupted in jubilant cheers, which quickly turned to sobs as they absorbed the weight of the moment. ""Oh my god,"" they said, wiping away tears. ""Wow."" Monica Brady, 49, a middle school principal in New York City, called the new vice president ""a kick-ass woman who would very easily fit in this set ... We see us reflected back to us, not just in her brownness, but her fierceness. She is a fierce woman! And everybody on this line is as well."" After Harris and Biden were sworn in, the women whooped and raised their glasses high in a toast, some with champagne, others with sparkling water and iced coffee. ""I love you guys,"" Giordani told her friends, before adding, ""We have a lot of work to do."" The women sipped as they listened to President Biden speak of unity and healing in his inaugural address, urging Americans to ""hear one another, see one another, show respect to one another."" Afterward, reflecting on his words, Wallace-Llodra said, ""I know a lot of people are a little offended by these calls for unity. I'm not, you know? Unify. Embrace them. They'll either come along or they won't."" She added, ""Now personally, the cynic in me thinks that they won't come along because they haven't. But there's nothing wrong with trying."" Former President Donald Trump did not declare martial law in his final minutes in office; nor did he reveal a secret plan to remain in power forever. President Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were not sent to Guantánamo Bay. The military did not rise up and arrest Democratic leaders en masse. Instead, Biden took the oath of office and became the 46th U.S. president on Wednesday. For some supporters of QAnon, this was an earth-shattering turn of events. Or rather, nonevents. QAnon is less a baseless conspiracy theory than an umbrella of many baseless conspiracy theories, but it centers on a belief that there is a shadowy cabal of pedophilic, satanic world leaders. For years, a mysterious figure called Q has issued promises that this cabal is on the verge of being exposed and defeated by Trump in a cataclysmic event that QAnon calls ""the Storm."" The baseless, often bizarre claims have gained a shocking amount of traction with the public. A recent NPR/Ipsos poll found that 17% of Americans believe that a group of Satan-worshipping, child-enslaving elites is trying to control the world, and another 37% aren't sure about the false allegation. And two women who have expressed some support for QAnon, Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene, are now sitting members of Congress. Now that Trump has left office, some QAnon supporters are baffled — or even giving up. New York Times tech columnist Kevin Roose tweeted out screenshots from groups on Telegram — a popular messaging service for QAnon supporters — on Wednesday, after the transfer of power was officially complete. ""Been played like fools,"" one wrote. Roose noted that one particularly prominent QAnon figure publicly announced that supporters need to ""go back to our lives as best we are able,"" rather than continue trying to overthrow Biden's presidency. Will Sommer, who tracks conservative media and is working on a book about QAnon, wrote in the Daily Beast that even late on Wednesday morning, QAnon groups were still hopeful that the mass arrests would materialize. But after noon, ""the mood changed quickly,"" Sommer wrote, with supporters saying they felt fooled by Trump and felt sick. Feeling fooled may not lead to a return to normalcy. One researcher told NBC News that frustrated, disappointed Q followers could be prime targets for radicalization by other extremist groups, like neo-Nazis. And, of course, not every Q follower is giving up the faith (an appropriate word — some argue that Q is best understood as a religious movement). The Times' Roose noted Q fans arguing with each other, with some declaring the movement over while others insisting the Storm was still coming. NBC's Ben Collins and Brandy Zadrozny took a look at one of the largest QAnon Telegram groups, which briefly shut down on Wednesday and reopened with ""a range of reactions: confusion and realization that QAnon was in fact a hoax, as well as renewed commitment to the conspiracy theory, despite its unreliability."" Researcher Travis View told The Washington Post that it was only a ""minority ... facing reality,"" while others are simply shifting their expectations. It's a process they're familiar with, after all: A multitude of Q predictions has failed to materialize, and that has never stopped the conspiracies from spreading. Like apocalyptic cults that persist despite a noteworthy lack of apocalypse, QAnon may survive the failed prophecies around the inauguration just like it has survived other failed prophecies before. President Biden is moving quickly on climate change on his first day in office, saying he plans to sign a sweeping executive order to undo many of the Trump administration's environmental rollbacks. Biden's pledge to rejoin the international Paris climate accord tops his list of immediate steps. Former President Donald Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the landmark agreement in 2017, which was completed in November. The Trump administration also weakened or undid other, lesser-known climate and environmental policies that Biden has vowed to restore. Biden will instruct federal agencies to review more than 100 policies, many crucial to curbing heat-trapping emissions, including fuel economy standards for cars and pollution limits on the oil and gas industry. ""A cry for survival comes from the planet itself, a cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear,"" Biden said in his inaugural address Wednesday. The Trump administration systematically loosened Obama-era environmental standards that range from energy-efficiency standards for appliances and buildings to air quality standards designed to protect public health. Some of those rollbacks, such as fuel economy standards for cars and trucks, went further than the industry wanted. Under President Barack Obama, automakers had negotiated efficiency standards that gradually became tougher year after year. Federal agencies under Trump instead froze the standards, leading some automakers to agree voluntarily to continue with the tougher rules. Fuel efficiency of cars and trucks in the U.S. fell for the first time in five years in 2019, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Transportation is the country's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. The Biden administration will also instruct the federal government to consider the long-term economic impacts of climate change when making new regulations, what's known as the ""social cost"" of carbon. Under Obama, those costs were weighed against the immediate cost a new regulation might pose to an industry, given that climate impacts are increasingly costing billions across many economic sectors. The Trump administration did away with that practice in 2017. Biden is reestablishing the working group to issue those guidelines, including weighing ""environmental justice and intergenerational equity"" considerations. The planned moves were applauded by environmental groups, who warn the U.S. has little time to act to cut emissions. Scientists say the world is on track to exceed 1.5 Celsius degrees of warming, which will lead to higher sea level rise and more extreme heat waves and hurricanes. ""The sweeping nature of these executive orders are an important down payment in addressing the tatters left behind by President Trump,"" Kathleen Rest, executive director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement. ""They seek to reverse policies that fly in the face of science, harm public health and degrade the environment."" Updated at 9:37 p.m. ET Michael Pack resigned Wednesday as the CEO of the federal agency over the Voice of America and other federally funded international broadcasters after a turbulent seven-month tenure. He leaves the U.S. Agency for Global Media with a Trumpian legacy of ideological strife, lawsuits and scandal, his departure effective just two hours after the swearing-in of President Biden, who requested him to leave. Biden has named senior VOA news executive Kelu Chao as acting CEO. Pack came to lead the U.S. Agency for Global Media with the support of former President Donald Trump; his appointment was delayed more than two years in the U.S. Senate by lawmakers who feared he was too ideological and also who questioned his finances. The soft-spoken conservative documentary maker proved to be an ideological warrior in the mold of his patron, taking to one conservative news outlet after another to denounce his own staff, all in the name of fairness. In his resignation letter, Pack said he was ""solely focused upon reorienting the agency toward its missions."" And he attacked the request for his resignation as ""a partisan act,"" saying the leadership of the agency and its networks ""is meant to be non-partisan, untethered to alternations in the political regime."" He added, ""I had no political agenda coming into USAGM, and I still do not have one."" NPR conducted scores of interviews over the controversies Pack's actions engendered. And few at the agency or its broadcasters agreed with Pack's characterization of his mission or performance, instead characterizing him as seeking political control over their coverage. Just last week, a VOA reporter's insistent questions to then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and VOA Director Robert R. Reilly over the siege on Congress after a public event led to her demotion and an investigation. Pack routinely accused journalists of anti-Trump bias, sought to fire top executives as part of a ""deep state,"" ominously accused the networks of being receptive to foreign spies and denied requests for visa extensions from his own staffers who are foreign nationals. He initiated investigations over the bias claims, reaching into Voice of America's newsroom in ways a federal judge said broke the law and the First Amendment. Pack hired a Richmond, Va., law firm to investigate top U.S. Agency for Global Media executives after already seeking to oust them; new allegations, backed by correspondence reviewed by NPR, suggest he paid more than $2 million to that firm to conduct such reviews. (The lead partner on the investigation, John D. Adams, was a law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, the subject of a sympathetic 2020 documentary by Pack.) Pack even fired White House aides assigned to help him by the Trump administration, suspecting them of disloyalty. Throughout, he kept all but a small circle of advisers in the dark as to what he was doing. Former U.S. Agency for Global Media general counsel David Kligerman said the agency would have to work hard to put a ""terrible chapter"" behind it. Kligerman, who resigned late last month, had been suspended by Pack in August, along with other senior executives after Pack was unable to fire them more immediately. ""Pack seemed only to know how to destroy,"" Kligerman wrote in a statement to NPR, citing the CEO's record of ""firing or otherwise pushing out so many talented journalists, network heads, grantee board members, and civil servants."" ""It was wanton destruction, and shocking disregard for the most basic civility or norms,"" Kligerman wrote. ""Political staff targeted and terrorized career staff and others. It is hard to overstate the climate of fear and dread that existed at the Agency. It is then particularly ironic that in his letter of resignation Pack warns of future politicalization of the Agency: it is hard to see how one could have attempted to do more to politicize the Agency than Pack."" Pack sought to ensure his influence endured after his departure by forcing the networks the agency funds but does not own to accept new boards of directors stocked with conservative activists and writers. The networks include Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks. (VOA and Radio/TV Marti are owned by the federal government.) The new board members, announced this month, include Roger L. Simon, a columnist for the pro-Trump and conspiracy-theory recycling newspaper The Epoch Times who has written he believes the Jan. 6 attack on Congress by a pro-Trump mob was actually done by leftists in disguise, and Christian Whiton, a conservative foreign policy expert who has defended Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. According to three people with knowledge, the new Biden team appears poised to bring suspended executives back into the agency fold, replace the network chiefs appointed by Pack last month and to appoint new boards. The Biden administration did not immediately comment on Pack's departure. A permanent CEO for the U.S. Agency for Global Media will require approval by the Senate, now led by Democrats rather than Republicans, though Pack inspired an outcry on both sides of the aisle. Disclosure: This story was reported by NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik and edited by NPR media and technology editor Emily Kopp. Because of NPR CEO John Lansing's prior role as CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, no senior news executive or corporate executive at NPR reviewed this story before it was published. Updated at 5:06 p.m. ET Democrats officially took control of the Senate as Georgia's two new Democratic senators-elect were sworn in Wednesday afternoon, cementing a 50-50 split, with Vice President Harris serving as the tiebreaking vote in her new role as president of the the Senate. Harris administered the oath of office to Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff hours after her own swearing-in. The pair of Democratic victories in the Jan. 5 Senate runoff elections gave the party control of both the White House and Congress, with the thinnest of majorities in the upper chamber. Harris also swore in Democrat Alex Padilla, the former California secretary of state, to fill Harris' own Senate seat. He was appointed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat. ""The chair lays before the Senate ... a certificate of appointment to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of former Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California,"" she said, laughing, before adding, ""Yeah, that was very weird."" With the new senators' swearing-in complete, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., becomes the Senate majority leader and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the minority leader. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. , became the new president pro tempore of the Senate, placing him third in the line of succession to the presidency. He previously held this position from 2012 to 2015. Details of a power-sharing agreement are still being developed by Schumer and McConnell to lay out practical issues about the chamber's operations going forward. A Democratic majority, however narrow, will enable the party to set the chamber's legislative agenda and make it easier to confirm President Biden's Cabinet picks. Georgia's Secretary of State's office certified the results of the runoff elections the day before Biden's inauguration. Biden was the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Georgia since 1992. Ossoff and Warnock's wins were also history-making. Ossoff is the state's first Jewish senator and Warnock is Georgia's first Black senator and the first Black Democratic senator from the South. Padilla's appointment is also historic: He is the first Latino to represent California in the U.S. Senate. President Joe Biden has picked a slate of nearly two dozen acting officials to temporarily lead agencies as he waits for Congress to confirm his Cabinet. According to a list of officials issued by the White House on Wednesday, most of the temporary leaders are career civil servants. Still, the 46th president entered the White House on Inauguration Day with no Cabinet members yet confirmed by the Senate, making him the first president in recent history to take charge of the nation without key advisors in place. Here's a full list of those who will be assisting in the next phase of the transition of government: Five of Biden's Cabinet nominees faced Senate panels on Tuesday in the first step of the confirmation process. Among them were Janet Yellen, selected to lead the Treasury Department; Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden's choice to head the Department of Homeland Security; Antony Blinken to helm the State Department; retired Gen. Lloyd Austin for Secretary of Defense; and Avril Haines, to lead the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Prior to his swearing in, Biden pledged he'd hit the ground running on a number of his top priorities, ranging from reversing former President Trump's travel ban on Muslim-majority nations to rejoining the Paris Climate Accord, and taking the reigns on plans to curb the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging the nation. Biden is expected to sign 17 executive actions within the first few hours of his presidency. President Biden, Vice President Harris and their families received a presidential escort to the White House on Wednesday afternoon, hours after the new administration was officially sworn into office. Biden's ride to the White House came as part of a day of inauguration activities, including the swearing in ceremony at the Capitol and a wreath-laying event at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery. Biden's motorcade was met by a military procession as he made his way to his new home at the White House. Joining in with supporters and a marching band, the new president got out of his vehicle just outside of the executive mansion to greet well-wishers and the media, including Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and famed weatherman Al Roker. He completed the rest of the trip to the White House on foot. Biden plans to get an early start on his presidential duties, including the planned signing of 17 executive orders aimed at tackling the coronavirus pandemic, the climate crisis, racial justice and the economy, among other issues. The president is expected to hold events well into the evening, including virtually swearing in presidential appointees and an appearance on the Blue Room Balcony. Inauguration Day wouldn't be complete without a meme or two to mark the occasion. The creation of memes on the day when past presidents and lawmakers watch as a new president takes the oath of office has become somewhat of a hallmark in recent years. Who can forget, for example, former President George W. Bush's trials with a rain poncho during former President Trump's inauguration? Wednesday offered several viable contenders for the most celebrated meme of the day. There's several dedicated to former First Lady Michelle Obama's stunning burgundy Sergio Hudson ensemble, and the change in expression on her face from the last time she attended a presidential inauguration. And Lady Gaga, who sang the national anthem, had fans comparing her outfit with that of the character Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games. No doubt, Jennifer Lopez, who also performed during the inaugural ceremony, and her fiancé Alex Rodriguez' elaborate U.S. Capitol photo shoot will lead to some promising memes as well. But it was Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a former presidential contender himself, whose expression and cozy coat stole the show. Some had praise for his choice of mittens. Still others were amused at the senator's outfit selection and curmudgeonly expression. Others appreciated the sensible choice of outerwear on a chilly day in D.C. Some pointed out that the jacket, which appears to be from Burton, a snowboarding company based in his home state of Vermont, is the same one Sanders wore in his now-famous ""I am once again asking"" video. Still more speculated at what was in the envelope the 79-year-old senator was carrying. And others lifted the image of the senator and placed him in various locations. President Biden invoked what he called seven ""common objects we, as Americans, love"" in Wednesday's inaugural address. Biden's embrace of the seventh — ""the truth"" — offered a pointed critique of his predecessor (though never by name), the media and the nation itself. ""Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson,"" Biden said in an event carried by every major broadcast news outlet in the country and many abroad. ""There is truth and there are lies. Lies told for power and for profit. And each of us has a duty and a responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders, leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation, to defend the truth and defeat the lies."" Biden was overlooking the National Mall from the balcony of Congress as he made his remarks. And the ""painful lesson"" he referred to came from the role of lies and false claims amplified, in part, by conservative media outlets in inspiring the deadly and destructive assault on the U.S. Capitol building two weeks ago. Fox News hosts, commentators and guests were among those most prominently and falsely claiming that former President Donald Trump had been cheated of victory in the November election. And many of them also inflamed passions ahead of the Jan. 6 demonstration that turned into a riot, calling for a physical response to show Congress and then-Vice President Pence that they would not accept the certification of Biden's win. ""Look, I understand that many of my fellow Americans view the future with fear and trepidation. I understand they worry about their jobs,"" Biden said in his speech Wednesday, invoking his own father's fears about paying for mortgage and medical costs. ""I promise you, I get it. But the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting those who don't look like you. Or worship the way you do. Or don't get their news from the same sources you do."" Fox's coverage on Wednesday was largely affirming and laudatory of the new president's oratory and performance. The network has not publicly accounted for its own role in the divisions and wild conspiracy theories of the past five years, often circulated by Trump's associates and given true flight on Fox. Yet Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace declared Biden's inaugural address the best he had ever heard. And Wallace had a caution for his colleagues and rivals. ""I think that it was a call to all of us,"" Wallace told viewers, ""whether it's us on the air on cable or broadcast, whether it's us in social media, on our Twitter accounts, understanding that we have to deal from facts, from the truth, to hear each other out, as he said. A right to disagree, but not a right to violence."" Several Republican lawmakers reacted Wednesday to President Biden's inaugural address with optimism that both parties will be able to work together and find common ground as the new administration begins. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said the speech was ""very well-done."" ""I thought it's what we needed,"" she told Capitol Hill reporters following the address. Murkowski said that ""everything is possible"" when it comes to the Republican Party working with the Biden administration. ""We're going to have some issues that we just fundamentally disagree with. But I think, to the president's words, you can still disagree from a policy perspective and you can do so in ways that are still respectful and allow you to continue to work toward other goals."" Murkowski was the first Republican senator to call on former President Donald Trump to resign in the wake of the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection on the U.S. Capitol. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, another Republican critic of Trump, called Biden's words ""strong"" and ""very much needed."" ""We as a nation come together if we are told the truth and if we have leaders who stand for enduring American principles,"" he said. Romney's statement about telling the truth echoes comments he made the night of Jan. 6 after a violent mob of pro-Trump extremists breached the Capitol and forced lawmakers to delay by several hours their task of tallying the Electoral College votes. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine., told reporters Biden's speech ""struck the right themes of unity, a call for us to come together, to stop viewing one another as adversaries but rather as fellow Americans."" Regarding working with the Biden administration going forward, Collins expressed optimism. ""Many of us have long-standing relationships with him,"" she said. ""I served with him for many years as fellow senators, and I worked with him when he was vice president. So I stand ready to work with him to advance common goals. We'll see what his agenda is."" Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., also tweeted his support for Biden, writing, ""I commend President Biden for his call for national unity, and his assurance to those who did not support him that he will nevertheless be president for all Americans."" With a razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate, Biden will likely need some Republican support for his legislative agenda. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., told reporters he thinks it's ""important to unite the country,"" but that he has reservations over some of Biden's impending executive orders. ""My concern is, of course, some of the executive orders that are coming, specifically in regard to the Keystone XL pipeline,"" he told reporters Wednesday afternoon. Biden is revoking a cross-border presidential permit needed to finish the Keystone XL pipeline, which likely means the end of the $8 billion project. The traditional inaugural parade was not an option this year, given security fears and the coronavirus pandemic. So instead, the Biden Inaugural Committee is throwing a ""Parade Across America"" — a virtual celebration involving dancers, drum lines, singers and athletes from across the United States. It might sound like a stretch. But the Democratic Party had a surprise hit on its hands when it convened a remote roll call during the Democratic National Convention, which turned out to be more popular than you might have guessed. The University of Delaware and Howard University, the alma maters of President Biden and Vice President Harris, respectively, did send drum lines that are physically in Washington, D.C., and will perform live. Otherwise, the parade will be remote. The Parade Across America will be hosted by Tony Goldwyn, and the names in the lineup include Jon Stewart, the reunited New Radicals (of ""You Get What You Give"" fame), Earth, Wind & Fire and, as the Biden Inaugural Committee puts it, ""everyday Americans."" It will also feature figure skaters, Olympians, at least one skateboarder, representatives of every branch of the military, a wheelchair basketball program, a doctor who's big on TikTok, an 80-year-old performer from Idaho, a 12-year-old trumpeter from Georgia, marching bands, flag twirlers, a clogging group, Boy Scouts and a Dance Across America led by Kenny Ortega. You can view the full lineup here. President Biden traveled from the U.S. Capitol across the Potomac River to Arlington National Cemetery after his inauguration ceremony Wednesday afternoon to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. He was joined by Vice President Harris as well as former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, along with their spouses and members of their families. Biden and Harris each touched the wreath, and Biden made the sign of the cross before saluting. A military bugler then played taps. The nation's 46th president arrived at the ceremony in an armored presidential limousine with the license plate reading ""46"" after driving along the security fence-lined streets of Washington, D.C. Updated at 5:40 p.m. ET As President Joe Biden took the oath of office on Jan. 20 with his history-making vice president, Kamala Harris, people across the nation seemed cautiously optimistic. Biden and Harris take office in the wake of a violent and deadly attempt by supporters of President Donald Trump to block Congress from certifying Electoral College votes on Jan. 6. In the two weeks since the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, federal law enforcement officers have made arrests and charged people from across the nation with participation in the riot. On Wednesday, as Biden told Americans that democracy had prevailed and called for a day of renewal and resolve, people across the country talked about a return to normalcy. ""I'm happy if he can do his agenda,"" Kay, a 57-year-old Trump supporter told KCUR reporter Frank Morris. ""I mean, he seems like he's a level-headed guy, and I hope that's the truth. I hope that that's what he follows. Cause then America would be better, but I'm worried that it's gonna swing too far left."" Kay, who lives in the suburbs of Kansas City, Mo., and declined to share her last name, said she hoped that the Biden administration would reunite Americans. ""That's all I want. I want America first,"" she said. ""I just want our country back to normal."" Sherry Webster, a 71-year-old from Kansas City, Mo., told Morris she thought the United States had turned a corner, but there was still a lot of work needed to bring the country together. ""We've got a steep road ahead, a really steep road ahead, but I think Biden through all his tragedy in his life, has gained a lot of wisdom,"" Webster said. ""I think he's somebody that can reach out to both sides and it really speaks to people. So I think we're headed in a good direction."" New York City was quiet during the inauguration Wednesday. Outside Trump Tower, where so many demonstrations have been held over the past four years, there were notably few people. One couple stopped by with their signs and hats from the first Women's March in 2017. ""It wasn't even a conscious feeling I woke up feeling energized. I feel the relief of not having to monitor second by second terrible decisions,"" 53-year-old Wendy Brandes told WNYC's Stephen Nessen. Nearby, 21-year-old Diana Hernandez who works in Times Square said that during Trump's term, tourists often felt emboldened to yell anti-immigrant slurs at her. She hopes that era is over now. ""I feel better ... knowing that there's a better president and a female co-president in the White House,"" Hernandez said. ""I have a good feeling for the future and the generation to come, because it shows that we have more opportunities for women."" Even some Trump supporters in the city said they would give Biden a chance to show what he can do to improve the country. Reaction to the inauguration was also muted in more conservative parts of the country. Jason Smith stood in line at a DMV in rural Southwest Idaho as Biden was sworn in. Not that he would have probably watched the new president's address anyway. More than 60 court cases challenging the election results in swing states were thrown out because the Trump campaign couldn't provide evidence of widespread fraud, but Smith doesn't think Biden was fairly elected. ""We just want to be left alone in this country,"" Smith told NPR's Kirk Siegler. ""Trump was our president, and for most of us, he still is our president. We still follow him."" Matt Gnojek of Denver usually wears his Capt. America outfit when he travels the country to raise money for pediatric cancer. But he was outside the Colorado State Capitol on Wednesday urging Americans to come together and believe in democracy. ""I just decided that a little more love, a little more smiles might be useful to more than just the kids, but maybe to some of the adults out there facing hardship as well,"" he told reporter Bente Birkeland of Colorado Public Radio. Gnojek thinks democracy is thriving rather than failing. ""But we have to trust it. You have to trust each other,"" he said. ""The claims of widespread voter fraud, it's a big beast to tackle. But if I had to venture a guess, I would say that the reason that they feel the way that they do about voter fraud is because their love for country, their love for each other was in fact manipulated by forces that wanted to see us divided."" Outside the state Capitol building in Harrisburg, Pa., one Trump supporter seemed ready to let go of the false claims of election fraud. ""It's over. There is nothing they can do about it. It is what it is. I accept that,"" Ryan Stevenson of Carlisle, Pa., told WITF's Sam Dunklau. ""I am not interested in finding out what the facts were, the truth was. It doesn't matter to me. It's over."" For Matt Conberry, a Biden supporter from Wallingford, Pa., moving on sounds like a good idea. ""It's a very simple message. A lot of this country thinks the election might have been stolen. Or that democracy doesn't work,"" he said. ""You know, it's the best we got. You know what I mean? If you don't trust the results of the election, I don't know what else we will do as a country."" President Biden plans to extend a nationwide pause on evictions through the end of March. The federal eviction moratorium, implemented through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is intended to help tenants who have been battered economically by the pandemic. ""Without this action by President Joe Biden, millions of renters could have lost their homes during this surge in COVID-19,"" says Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. But, she adds, the moratorium itself is insufficient and allows some landlords to evict tenants despite the protections. For example, she notes that no federal agency is enforcing the order's penalties for unlawful evictions. NPR has reported on families getting evicted despite the CDC order, which, in spirit, directs landlords not to put people out in the street for nonpayment of rent and into living situations where they can catch and spread the coronavirus. Already, one study has attributed thousands of deaths in the U.S. to evictions during the pandemic because displaced families have been forced into more crowded living conditions. Housing advocates say the CDC order is not an automatic eviction ban. Many renters don't know how to take advantage of it. Tenants must sign a CDC declaration and provide it to landlords and, in some cases, to local housing courts. The recent COVID-19 relief bill passed by Congress provides billions of dollars to pay landlords for back rent and future rent payments as millions of Americans remain unemployed and struggling to pay their bills. The hope is that too will prevent evictions since landlords only get compensated if tenants remain in place on the property. Biden is also expected to extend deadlines for moratoriums aimed at protecting homeowners from foreclosure. Updated Jan. 21 at 3:10 p.m. ET Following President Biden's executive action signed Wednesday, the Education Department extended pandemic relief for about 41 million federal student loan borrowers through Sept. 30. ""Too many Americans are struggling to pay for basic necessities and to provide for their families,"" the Education Department said in a statement. ""They should not be forced to choose between paying their student loans and putting food on the table."" In March 2020, borrowers were granted a reprieve on their loan payments — interest was set to 0% and collections of defaulted federal student loans were paused. Congress initiated this relief in the CARES Act. Both President Donald Trump and, later, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, extended it. Before Biden's executive action, the relief was set to expire on Jan. 31. The back and forth on deadlines has been a challenge for borrowers. Research from the Pew Charitable Trusts conducted in August and September found that, among borrowers who said the relief applied to them, about 40% did not know when their loan payments were set to resume. That research also found that borrowers are struggling financially due to the pandemic: Almost 6 in 10 borrowers with paused payments reported to Pew that it would be difficult to begin making their payments if they had to do so in the next month. With the extension for the next eight months, borrowers and loan servicers now have a longer runway to prepare for when repayment starts. ""The extension of the payment pauses provides much needed relief to borrowers during the pandemic in the short-term,"" says Sarah Sattelmeyer, director of the Pew Charitable Trust's Student Borrower Success project. The big question now is what happens next. Many hope that temporary pandemic relief for borrowers will open the door to more permanent loan forgiveness. But it's unclear to what extent the Biden administration would do that. On Jan. 8, David Kamin, the incoming deputy director of Biden's National Economic Council, repeated Biden's support of Congress canceling up to $10,000 in federal student loans per borrower in response to the pandemic. But many Democrats want him to go further. In September, Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer unveiled a plan calling for the next president to cancel up to $50,000 of outstanding federal student loans per borrower. Biden has yet to signal interest in this plan. In his campaign proposal, he outlined a number of changes to paying back loans, including canceling $10,000 in debt for students who work in national or community service. As part of his ambitious plan to address climate change, President Biden is revoking a key cross-border presidential permit needed to finish the controversial Keystone XL pipeline This likely means the end of the $8 billion pipeline, a years-long project that would have carried oil sands crude from Alberta, Canada, to the American Gulf Coast. The pipeline has come to signify the debate over whether fossil fuels should be left in the ground in order to rein in greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the worst damage from climate change. President Barack Obama rejected the project in 2015. President Donald Trump revived it as one of his first actions in office. Construction on Keystone XL began last year, and the company says about 300 miles of the pipeline has been built so far. TC Energy says in a statement that ""advancement of the project will be suspended"" and that the company likely will take a hit to its first quarter earnings. While the company's announcement was straightforward, oil industry groups that supported the project decried the Biden decision. ""Killing 10,000 jobs and taking $2.2 billion in payroll out of workers' pockets is not what Americans need or want right now,"" said Andy Black, president and CEO of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines. Those jobs were temporary construction jobs and included workers from an Oklahoma union being sued by its Black members for discrimination. Environmentalists opposed the pipeline because of the oil sands crude it would have carried. Producing that oil requires extra processing that emits more of the greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. Those groups praised Biden's decision along with his vow to rejoin the Paris climate agreement after Trump withdrew. ""It makes the United States once more part of the global climate solution — not the problem,"" responded Mitchell Bernard, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the pipeline was a key priority for him. The province of Alberta, which is an investor in the project, has said it will work with the company to pursue legal remedies."
npr|"There's widespread agreement that it's important to help older adults and people with disabilities remain independent as long as possible. But are we prepared to do what's necessary, as a nation, to make this possible? That's the challenge President Biden has put forward with his bold proposal to spend $400 billion over eight years on home and community-based services — a major part of his $2 trillion infrastructure plan. It's a ""historic and profound"" opportunity to build a stronger framework of services surrounding vulnerable people who need considerable ongoing assistance, says Ai-jen Poo, director of Caring Across Generations, a national group advocating for older adults, individuals with disabilities, families and caregivers. It comes as the coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc in nursing homes, assisted living facilities and group homes, killing more than 174,000 people, by some estimates, and triggering awareness of the need for more long-term care options. ""There's a much greater understanding now that it is not a good thing to be stuck in long-term care institutions"" and that community-based care is an ""essential alternative, which the vast majority of people would prefer,"" says Ari Ne'eman, a doctoral student in health policy at Harvard University, and senior research associate at Harvard Law School's Project on Disability. ""The systems we do have are crumbling"" due to underfunding and understaffing, and ""there has never been a greater opportunity for change than now,"" saids Katie Smith Sloan, president of LeadingAge, at a recent press conference where the president's proposal was discussed. LeadingAge is a national association of more than 5,000 nonprofit nursing homes, assisted living centers, senior living communities and home care providers. But prospects for the president's proposal are uncertain. Republicans decry its cost and argue that much of what the proposed American Jobs Plan contains, including the emphasis on home-based care, doesn't count as real infrastructure. ""Though this proposal is a necessary step to strengthen our long-term care system, politically it will be a challenge,"" suggests Joseph Gaugler, a professor at the University of Minnesota's School of Public Health, who studies long-term care. Even advocates of Biden's proposal acknowledge it doesn't address the full extent of care needed by the nation's rapidly growing older population. In particular, middle-income seniors won't qualify directly for programs that would be expanded. They would, however, benefit from a larger, better paid, better trained workforce of aides that help people in their homes — one of the plan's objectives. ""This plan isn't everything that's needed, not by any step of the imagination,"" Poo says. ""What we really want to get to is universal access to long-term care. But that will be a multistep process."" Understanding what's at stake is essential as communities across the country and Congress begin discussing Biden's proposal. The services in question Home and community-based services help people who need significant assistance live at home as opposed to nursing homes or group homes. Services can include home visits from nurses or occupational therapists; assistance with personal care such as eating or bathing; help from case managers; attendance at adult day centers; help with cooking, cleaning and other chores; transportation; and home repairs and modifications. It can also help pay for durable medical equipment such as wheelchairs or oxygen tanks. The need Statistics suggest that, at some point in their lives, 70% of older adults in the U.S. will require help with dressing, hygiene, moving around, managing finances, taking medications, cooking, housekeeping and other daily needs, usually for two to four years. As the nation's aging population expands to 74 million in 2030 (the year the youngest baby boomers reach age 65 ), that need will expand exponentially. Younger adults and children with conditions such as cerebral palsy, blindness or intellectual disabilities can similarly require significant assistance. The burden on families Currently, 53 million family members provide most of the care that vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities require — without being paid and often at significant financial and emotional cost. According to AARP, family caregivers on average devote about 24 hours a week to helping loved ones and spend around $7,000 out-of-pocket on that care. This reflects a sobering reality: for most individuals and families paying for long-term care services is even more expensive than providing the care themselves.. According to a survey last year by Genworth, a financial services firm, the hourly cost for a home health aide averages $24. Annually, assisted living centers charge an average $51,600, while a semiprivate room in a nursing home goes for $93,075. Medicare limitations Many people assume that Medicare — the nation's health program for 61 million older adults and people with severe disabilities — will pay for long-term care, including home-based services. But Medicare coverage is extremely limited. Medicare covers home-based health care services only for older adults and people with severe disabilities who are homebound and need skilled services from nurses and therapists. It does not pay for 24-hour care or care for personal aides or homemakers. In 2018, about 3.4 million Medicare members received home health services. In nursing homes, Medicare pays only for rehabilitation services for a maximum of 100 days. It does not provide support for long-term stays in nursing homes or assisted living facilities. Medicaid options Medicaid — the federal-state health program for 72 million children and adults in low-income households — can be an alternative, but financial eligibility standards are strict and only people with meager incomes and assets qualify. Medicaid supports two types of long-term care: home and community-based services and those provided in institutions such as nursing homes. But only care in institutions is mandated by the federal government. Home and community-based services are provided at the discretion of the states. Although all states offer home and community-based services of some kind, there's enormous variation in the types of services offered, who is served (states can set caps on enrollment) and state spending. Generally, people need to be frail enough to need nursing home care to qualify. Nationally, 57% of Medicaid's long-term care budget goes to home and community-based services — $92 billion in the 2018 federal budget year. But half of states still spend twice as much on institutional care as they do on community-based care. And 41 states have waiting lists for home and community-based health services, totaling nearly 820,000 people, with an average wait of 39 months. Based on the best information available, between 4 million and 5 million people receive Medicaid-funded home and community-based services — a fraction of those who need care. Workforce issues Biden's proposal doesn't specify how the $400 billion in additional funding would be spent, beyond stating that access to home and community-based care would be expanded and caregivers would receive ""a long-overdue raise, stronger benefits and an opportunity to organize or join a union."" Caregivers, including nursing assistants and home health and personal care aides, earn $12 an hour, on average. Most are women of color; about one-third of those working for agencies don't receive health insurance from their employers. By the end of this decade, an extra 1 million workers will be needed for home-based care — a number of experts believe will be difficult, if not impossible, to reach given poor pay and working conditions. ""We have a choice to keep these poverty-wage jobs or make them good jobs that allow people to take pride in their work while taking care of their families,"" says Poo of Caring Across Generations. Next steps Biden's plan leaves out many details. For example: What portion of funding should go to strengthening the workforce? What portion should be devoted to eliminating waiting lists? What amount should be spent on expanding services? How will inequities of the current system — for instance, the lack of accessible services in rural counties or for people with dementia — be handled? ""We want to see funding to states tied to addressing those inequities,"" says Amber Christ, directing attorney of the health team at Justice in Aging, an advocacy organization. Meanwhile, supporters of the plan suggest it could be just the opening of a major effort to shore up other parts of the safety net. ""There are huge gaps in the system for middle-income families that need to be addressed,"" notes David Certner, AARP's legislative counsel. Reforms that should be considered include tax credits for caregivers, expanding Medicare's home health benefit and removing the requirement that people receiving Medicare home health support be homebound, says Christ of Justice in Aging. ""We should be looking more broadly at potential solutions that reach people who have some resources, but not enough to pay for these long-term services as well,"" Christ says.

npr|"When President Biden unveiled his major new infrastructure plan last week, the proposal included much more than fixing crumbling bridges. And for those who wish America had a more robust passenger train network, it gave them something new: hope. Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure package has two provisions involving passenger rail: $85 billion to modernize public transit (commuter rail, buses, stations, etc.) and $80 billion to improve and expand the nation's passenger and freight rail network. ""You and your family could travel coast to coast without a single tank of gas onboard a high-speed train,"" Biden said at the plan's unveiling. But the idea isn't just nice family trips — it's to use improved rail infrastructure and service to alleviate problems such as traffic and air pollution as well as improve access to jobs. Transportation is the largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. ""The American Jobs Plan will build new rail corridors and transit lines, easing congestion, cutting pollution, slashing commute times, and opening up investment in communities that can be connected to the cities, and cities to the outskirts, where a lot of jobs are these days. It'll reduce the bottlenecks of commerce at our ports and our airports,"" Biden said. The White House said the rail investment would ""address Amtrak's repair backlog; modernize the high traffic Northeast Corridor; improve existing corridors and connect new city pairs; and enhance grant and loan programs that support passenger and freight rail safety, efficiency, and electrification."" Amtrak quickly responded with enthusiasm to Biden's plan, with a map and a vision for what an expanded U.S. rail network would look like by 2035. The proposed transformation would mean some 30 new routes, and more trips on 20 existing ones. It projects 20 million more people served than the 32 million that rode Amtrak in the 2019 fiscal year. It shows an array of potential new service lines: new rail connecting all of Texas' biggest cities and new connections across the Midwest, including between Cincinnati, Columbus, Ohio, and Cleveland. In the Southeast, new routes would stretch from Atlanta to Chattanooga and Nashville, Tenn., Savannah, Ga., and Montgomery, Ala. There would be service to every state in the contiguous U.S. but South Dakota — a fact that drew the ire of Gov. Kristi Noem, who criticized the infrastructure package. Amtrak says better rail service means ""cleaner air, less traffic, and happier people,"" and it points to inequality that has resulted from the country's current patchy train service: ""Many of the country's biggest and fastest growing metropolitan areas, with diverse populations, don't have the rail service they deserve."" Cities such as Houston, Atlanta and Cincinnati currently have bare-bones Amtrak service, with trains that only stop once a day and often in the middle of the night. Major cities including Las Vegas, Nashville, Columbus and Phoenix don't have any Amtrak service at all. And that happiness bit? Amtrak notes that in some cities, people spend more than 80 hours a year in traffic. ""Population growth will make this much worse without better alternatives like rail,"" it warns. Around the country, local news dug into what expanded rail could mean for their communities. ""More direct train service between Raleigh and Richmond — and cities beyond. New passenger lines running to the North Carolina coast and to the state's mountains,"" Raleigh, N.C.'s The News & Observer wrote. ""Prospects for a passenger rail line connecting Baton Rouge and New Orleans got a boost this week,"" wrote the New Orleans Advocate, noting that the last passenger train to serve Baton Rouge, La., ended service in 1969. ""Amtrak may soon have the cash to install a new rail line between Las Vegas and Los Angeles,"" the Reno Gazette-Journal said. ""President Joe Biden's infrastructure improvement plan would bring Amtrak passenger service back to Phoenix for the first time in decades,"" NPR member station KJZZ noted. And on Twitter, people started posting the rail lines they'd like to see. Like a direct route from Ohio to Florida. Before all that can happen, an infrastructure bill will need to get through Congress. The House and Senate are both working on infrastructure bills, which are expected to include what the administration has proposed, but the process is still unclear. For those eager for alternatives to the car, the historic proposal by a president known for his former daily commute by Amtrak from home in Wilmington, Del., to D.C. is what they've been waiting for. ""President Biden's plan would revolutionize the way Americans travel, finally launching U.S. passengers into the 21st century,"" said Jim Mathews, president and CEO of the Rail Passengers Association."
npr|"Hundreds of migrant children and teens traveling without their parents have been held in jail-like detention centers at the border for 10 days, and longer, a DHS document obtained by NPR shows. Under law, minors are only allowed to spend 72 hours in the detention centers, which are run by Customs and Border Protection. But as of Thursday, more than 500 of the young migrants have spent more than 240 hours in the border facilities, according to the DHS documents. Spokespersons for CBP and DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Thursday. The Biden administration is struggling to address the rapidly growing number of unaccompanied minors arriving at the border. Biden administration officials acknowledged the challenge, but earlier on Thursday told reporters they are ""dealing with the hand they were dealt"" by the previous administration. ""The president inherited a mess, which is the result of four years and one thousand policies that had the intent of undermining and weakening the entire immigration system,"" a Biden administration official told reporters on a briefing call. As of Thursday, 4,600 minors were being held at the CBP facilities – a 30% increase in just one week, and a record for the detention centers. Officials said the administration has opened two emergency sites this week to help house the children: one in Midland, Texas; the other at a convention center in Dallas. The two sites can house 2,000 children. As of the end of February, about 29,000 unaccompanied migrant children have reached the border for the fiscal year beginning in October, the administration officials told reporters. A total of 9,562 are in the custody of Health and Human Services where they spend 34 days on average, officials said. U.S. border patrol officials encountered about 120,000 people attempting to cross the southwest U.S. border in February, a 28% increase over the previous month, Biden administration officials said. Most were turned back, but some families have been allowed to enter the country while they await consideration of asylum claims. ""So four years cannot be undone in eight weeks, but we are making progress every single day,"" an official told reporters Thursday."
npr|"As President Biden pushes to get students back in schools, there's one crucial question: How much social distance is necessary in the classroom? The answer (to that question) has huge consequences for how many students can safely fit into classrooms. Public schools in particular are finding it difficult to accommodate a full return if 6 feet of social distancing is required — a key factor behind many schools offering hybrid schedules that bring students back to the classroom just a few days a week. The CDC's current guidance for schools recommends seating or desks be ""at least 6 feet apart when feasible."" But a new study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases suggests that 3 feet may be as safe as 6 feet, so long as everyone is masked. The authors compared infection rates at Massachusetts schools that required at least 3 feet of distancing with those that required at least 6 feet, and found no significant difference in the coronavirus case rates among students or staff in the two cohorts. The authors pointed out an important caveat to the findings: It's possible that districts that allowed a minimum of 3 feet were able to attain larger distances than that in reality – and in that case, the study would be capturing official policy but not its real-world implementation. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the CDC, addressed the Massachusetts study at the White House COVID-19 briefing on Monday, and noted that schools have struggled with the 6-foot guidance. ""We are looking at these data carefully,"" Walensky said. ""The question actually prompted more studies to be done, so we know more are forthcoming. We're taking all of those data carefully and revisiting our guidances in that context."" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious diseases official and Biden's chief adviser on COVID-19, was asked about the findings on Sunday. ""When the data shows that there is an ability to be 3 feet, the CDC will act accordingly,"" Fauci told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""The CDC is very well aware that data are accumulating making it look more like 3 feet are okay under certain circumstances."" The CDC will update its guidance if the data merits it, Fauci said. The World Health Organization's school guidance suggests that in areas with community transmission of COVID-19, at least 1 meter (3.28 feet) of distance should be maintained between individuals. That's much shorter than the CDC's recommended 6 feet. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that desks be placed at least 3 feet apart, and 6 feet if possible. But it notes that in many schools, 6 feet is not possible without severely limiting the number of students. As a consequence, the APA says, ""Schools should weigh the benefits of strict adherence to a 6-feet spacing rule between students with the potential downside if remote learning is the only alternative."" Biden's new education secretary Miguel Cardona told NPR recently that one way to achieve social distancing requirements is to use parts of the school building differently. He pointed to a Connecticut school that was using its gymnasium as a classroom for part of the day, and he said warm weather allows for the possibility of outdoor classrooms. While such conversions take resources, Cardona said, ""I think it can be done, and it can be done safely."""
npr|"ROME — The second Roman Catholic president in American history is a devout man who makes no secret of the importance of faith in his life. President Joe Biden is a regular churchgoer, often quotes St. Augustine and carries a rosary that belonged to his late son Beau. In one of the first images released of him in the Oval Office, a photo was visible behind his desk showing him with Pope Francis. The Argentine-born pope and the new American president have both staked out liberal stances on issues like climate change and economic disparity, and have taken different positions from their ""culture warrior"" predecessors. Biden diametrically differs from former President Donald Trump in his support for a more inclusive society, on issues ranging from immigration and health care to LGBTQ equality. Francis has moved away from Pope John Paul II's and Benedict XVI's emphasis on sexual morality, preferring to focus on social justice and the rights of the poor and marginalized. He has repeatedly lashed out at what he describes as the destructive effects of laissez-faire capitalism on society and the environment. The pope and the president have a lot in common, says Paul Elie, a scholar of Catholicism at Georgetown University. ""Their informality, the fact that they were elected late in life, the fact that they seem to take issues as they come, listening, discerning and then acting,"" he says. ""And both of them, I think, have surprised their people by turning out to be more progressive than was expected."" In the November election, just over half of American Catholics voted against Biden, in great part because of his support for laws such as those guaranteeing abortion rights that run contrary to Church doctrine. Nevertheless, the new president has a friend — and potential ally — at the Vatican. On Inauguration Day, Pope Francis sent Biden a warm note saying, ""Grave crises facing our human family call for farsighted and united responses."" Relations between Pope Francis and Trump were at best chilly. When Trump was still a candidate in 2016, Pope Francis suggested he was ""not a Christian"" for his campaign vow to deport more immigrants and build a wall along the border with Mexico. A year later, the pope wondered how Trump could claim to be ""pro-life"" while ordering policies that broke up the families of immigrants and asylum seekers. Biden's election was welcomed by the Vatican — but without mention of his support for abortion rights, says Villanova University theology professor Massimo Faggioli. ""It's clear that they see this moment as a return to some sanity. This is what the Vatican really holds dear,"" says Faggioli, ""so that that there is a predictability in the relations between countries and leaders."" Faggioli, the author of Joe Biden and Catholicism in the United States, argues that under the influence of the previous two papacies, the U.S. Catholic Church leadership became increasingly traditionalist, ignoring any discourse on racism, rule of law or voting rights — and has thus become more closely allied with the political right. He points out that Biden and the pope share the same detractors among American Catholic leaders — the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, which he says ""is dominated by ultraconservative Catholic bishops whose political sympathies lie very clearly with the Republican Party, and not just on the abortion issue."" The Vatican was reportedly annoyed by a bishops' conference statement on Inauguration Day. Signed by the group's leader, Archbishop José H. Gomez, the statement lamented that ""our new President has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender."" It added that ""for the nation's bishops, the continued injustice of abortion remains the preeminent priority."" An unnamed senior Vatican official told the Catholic publication America, ""It is most unfortunate and is likely to create even greater divisions within the Church in the United States."" ""So, there is an extremist wing of the Catholic Church,"" says Faggioli, ""which is a handful of bishops, but a bigger chunk of the clergy."" For example, last August, the Rev. James Altman of La Crosse, Wisc., posted a video to YouTube in which he proclaimed, ""You cannot be Catholic and be a Democrat, period. Their party platform absolutely is against everything the Catholic Church teaches. Repent of your support of that party and its platform or face the fires of hell."" It has been viewed more than a million times. Not all conservative Catholics strike such an apocalyptic tone toward Democrats. But many share a message of condemnation. In a podcast last month with the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank, George Weigel, an author and political analyst who has written extensively about the Catholic Church, said the new president seems quite sincere in his personal piety. But he went on to attack Biden, saying he ""facilitates grave moral evils. Mr. Biden is an incoherent Catholic and incoherent Catholics should not be presenting themselves for Holy Communion as if they were living in full communion with the church."" As both Francis and Biden ignore their Catholic critics, presidential historian Timothy Naftali sees potential parallels now with a period at the peak of the Cold War six decades ago. Six months after the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world to the precipice of nuclear annihilation in 1962, Pope John XXIII issued the Pacem in Terris encyclical. Addressed not just to Catholics but to all people ""of good will,"" it called for peacemaking through negotiation. A week later, President John F. Kennedy cited the document in a major speech, and was subsequently able to win domestic support for a nuclear test ban treaty with the Soviet Union. Naftali believes the pope and Biden could join forces against climate change — the great threat facing humanity today. ""Given the prominence of Pope Francis on this issue, the fact that he has identified climate change as an existential threat,"" says Naftali, ""there is a natural partnership with a secular leader who has also identified climate change as an existential threat. These are two leaders powerful in different realms. That's an opportunity. And it's not an opportunity that comes every generation."" Naftali is convinced that amid so much disinformation on the coronavirus pandemic and vaccines, these two prominent Catholics could also work together to convince more people that science and faith are not mutually exclusive."
npr|"For President Biden, it's a $1.9 trillion gamble. If successful, his ""American Rescue Plan"" will help struggling families and businesses weather an unprecedented pandemic and provide a boost to a badly dented economy. It's also broadly popular with voters. Critics, however, worry it will be end up being a poorly targeted plan that squanders trillions in borrowed money in ways that will do little to improve the nation's long-term economic outlook. ""We are well past the point where our economy is collapsing,"" said Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., this week. ""The last thing we need is a massive multi-trillion-dollar, universal spending bill."" And it's not just Republicans who are pushing back. ""The question isn't whether we need big stimulus,"" former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told NPR's Weekend Edition this month. ""The question is, do we need the biggest stimulus in American history?"" Congress has already passed trillions in aid since last year, leaving the country's deficit at its second highest since World War II. The latest stimulus plan is comprehensive, at least under the version that House Democrats are set to pass along party lines as early as Friday. For starters, it would include direct payments of $1,400 to most Americans. It would also include extended unemployment benefits, money to help schools reopen and aid to state and local governments. Progressives also hoped to use the plan to gradually boost the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, although that effort appeared in jeopardy after an adverse decision from the Senate parliamentarian Thursday night. Summers, who served in different positions in the Clinton and Obama administrations, has warned that deficit-financed spending now on a short-term relief package could make it harder for the Biden administration to find money later for long-term investments in things like infrastructure. He's also concerned that with consumer spending already on the rise, a surge in new federal spending could overwhelm businesses, triggering something the U.S. hasn't seen in a long time: inflation. ""We need to make sure we're concerned with not overheating the economy,"" Summers said. Senior administration officials, however, are pushing back, saying millions of Americans still need the help badly. ""I've spent many years studying inflation and worrying about inflation. And I can tell you we have the tools to deal with that risk if it materializes,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, a former Federal Reserve chair, told CNN this month. ""But we face a huge economic challenge here and tremendous suffering in the country,"" she added. ""We've got to address that. That's the biggest risk."" Biden has shown no signs of retreating from his plan. On Monday, he took his critics head-on. ""Critics say the plan is too big,"" Biden said. ""Let me ask them a rhetorical question: What would you have me cut?"" Plenty, according to critics of the plan. Here are key elements of Biden's plan, and why some are pushing back. $1,400 relief payments Biden's plan would send $1,400 payments to most Americans. That's in addition to the $600 payments that already went out this year and the $1,200 that went out to most Americans earlier in 2020. For lower-income families, who have been disproportionately hurt by the recession, the additional money could be an important lifeline. Households making less than $46,000 spent most of their $600 payments almost immediately, according to researchers at Harvard who studied credit and debit card data. But Biden's plan doesn't limit payments to lower-income families. Individuals making up to $75,000 and couples making up to $150,000 would be eligible for the full amount, while higher earners would receive less. Whether these higher-income Americans would spend those checks, delivering stimulus to the economy, is in doubt. According to the Harvard researchers, families making more than $78,000 spent little of their January payment, socking most of the money into savings. To critics, that makes the blanket federal payments to wealthier families unnecessary since many have been largely unscathed by the recession. ""The average household in America is in a better financial position today than it was before the pandemic,"" Toomey, the Pennsylvania senator, said this week. ""If there were to be further fiscal policy, it should address where the problem is and not where the problem is not."" Unemployment benefits At last count, some 19 million Americans were receiving some form of unemployment assistance. While the job market has improved since the early months of the pandemic, job gains have largely stalled in recent months. And forecasters say it could take some time before people in hard-hit service industries such as travel and live entertainment are back at work. In December, Congress approved a temporary extension of jobless benefits passed early in the pandemic, but that begins to run out in mid-March. Biden's plan would extend aid through August. It also boosts the federal government's supplemental unemployment benefit from $300 to $400 a week. Some employers have complained that robust jobless benefits discourage employees from going back to work or looking for new jobs. But researchers at the University of Chicago and the JPMorgan Chase Institute found little evidence of this. In the early months of the pandemic, when the federal government raised unemployment benefits by $600 per week, more than half the idled employees returned to work before those benefits ran out. When the extra benefits did expire last July, there was no sudden jump in people seeking new jobs. Researchers argue the supplemental benefits may have actually increased overall employment by giving jobless people more money to spend, which in turn helped pay the wages of other workers. Aid to Cities and States Biden's proposal includes $350 billion to address pandemic gaps in state and local government budgets. Yet those gaps have turned out to be smaller than many people feared and some governors like Asa Hutchinson from Arkansas say their states don't need the aid. ""On average, state revenue has mostly recovered. And the key reason for that is that income has mostly recovered,"" said Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""The economy is doing much better right now than we thought it was going to be doing early in the pandemic."" Because upper-income workers, who pay the lion's share of state taxes, have generally managed to keep working, the pandemic drain on state revenues has been muted. JPMorgan estimates that state revenues nationwide were only slightly lower in 2020 than the year before the pandemic. But that's not every state. Those that rely heavily on tourism and oil drilling have been hit much harder. ""States like Nevada and Hawaii and Alaska and Texas are not doing very well,"" Goldwein said. ""States like California have a $25 billion surplus. Idaho has had the fastest revenue growth it's seen in years. So there really are big differences between the states."" Those differences don't fall neatly along party lines, even though congressional Republicans have resisted state and local aid as a ""blue state bailout."" ""The pandemic isn't partisan,"" said Michael Leachman of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The budgets of some blue states like California have fared better than those in red states like North Dakota, where revenues fell nearly 10% last year, according to JPMorgan. State and local governments have cut nearly 1.3 million jobs in the past year — nearly twice as many as during the last recession. ""After the last recession, we made a big mistake. The federal government provided some aid to states and localities, but it was far too little and it ended much too soon and the effect of that was to really slow the economy's recovery,"" Leachman said. ""We would be much better off to make sure that we're not making the same mistake again. $15 minimum wage One of the most controversial aspects of the original Biden package was its push to gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025. That's more than twice the current federal minimum of $7.25 an hour, which hasn't budged since 2009. (Had the minimum wage simply kept pace with inflation, it would be about $9 an hour today.) The minimum wage provision ran into a procedural roadblock Thursday when the Senate parliamentarian said it could not be included in a budget bill under the special rules Senate Democrats are using to sidestep a GOP filibuster. Progressives vowed to pursue a wage hike through other means, but that effort faces long odds given political opposition from Senate Republicans and some moderate Democrats. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the parliamentarian's decision disappointing. ""House Democrats believe that the minimum wage hike is necessary. Therefore, this provision will remain in the American Rescue Plan"" when the House takes the bill up Friday, Pelosi said in a statement. Forecasters from the Congressional Budget Office say boosting the minimum wage to $15 an hour would deliver a pay raise to as many as 27 million Americans. But they caution it would also cost as many as 1.4 million jobs. Economists have long theorized raising pay for low-wage workers would come with trade-offs — including higher prices for consumers and a shift to automation. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell declined to take a position on the proposed wage hike this week — calling it a classic policy choice for lawmakers — but he did say research suggests the effects are more nuanced than was once believed. Although the federal minimum wage hasn't changed in more than a decade, many cities and states have already adopted higher minimums. Florida voters, for example, decided in November to boost that state's minimum to $15 an hour by 2026."
npr|"In early December, Dr. Katy Stephenson was watching TV with her family and scrolling through Twitter when she saw a tweet that made her shout. ""I said 'Oh, my God!' "" she recalls. ""Super loud. My kids jumped up. My husband looked over. He said, 'What's wrong, what's wrong, is everything OK?' I was like, 'No, no, it's the opposite. It's amazing. This is amazing!' "" Dr. Rochelle Walensky had just been tapped to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Stephenson is an infectious disease specialist and vaccine scientist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. So the news had special meaning for her and the many jubilant colleagues tweeting their joy. They'd all been helping each other through the brutal pandemic year, she says, but feeling like they got little to no help from the federal government. ""It was so baffling,"" she says. ""It wasn't even just that we didn't know what the government was doing. It was that sometimes it felt like sabotage. Like the federal government was actively trying to mess things up."" But through it all, as the long months became a year, Walensky had been out front, Stephenson says, sticking to the science and telling the truth. And from the moment Walensky stepped up to lead the CDC, she has promised to keep telling the truth. Even when it's bad news. Walensky told the medical journal JAMA last month that she'll welcome straight talk from the scientists at the CDC as well. ""They have been diminished,"" she said. ""I think they've been muzzled — that science hasn't been heard. This top tier agency, world-renowned, hasn't really been appreciated over the last four years and really markedly over the last year or so. I have to fix that."" Now 51 years old, Walensky has long been a doctor on a mission — first, to fight AIDS around the world, and now, to shore up the CDC and get the United States through the pandemic. Beyond unmuzzling her agency's staff, she vows to tackle many other challenges, pushing particularly hard on the vaccine rollout and rebuilding the public health system. Walensky's family has a tradition of service, including a grandfather who served in World War II and rose to be a brigadier general. And she likens the call she got from the Biden administration to a hospital alarm that goes off when a patient is in cardiac arrest. ""I got called during a code,"" she says. ""And when you get called during a code, your job is to be there to help."" At Massachusetts General Hospital, where Walensky was the chief of infectious diseases, some of her many admirers now have T-shirts that read ""Answer the Code"" with her initials, RPW, beneath. The shirts are part of an outpouring of affection in Boston biomedical circles and far beyond that greeted Walensky's appointment — including a flood of floral bouquets that her husband and three sons helped answer the door to accept after word of her new job got out. ""At one point, one of my sons said, 'You know, Dad, we should just open a florist shop at this point,"" says Rochelle Walensky's husband, Dr. Loren Walensky. He studies and treats children's blood cancers at Boston Children's Hospital and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. And now he could be called the ""first gentleman"" of the CDC. He calls Rochelle his ""Wonder Woman"" and still remembers when he first saw her 30 years ago, in the cafeteria of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where they were both students. ""She stood out,"" he says. ""And one of the reasons why she stood out is because she stands tall. Rochelle is 6 feet tall."" She also had extraordinary energy and discipline, even then, he remembers: ""Most of us would roll out of bed and stumble into the lecture hall as our first activity of the day, and for Rochelle, she was already up and running and bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for hours before any of us ever saw the light of day."" After medical school, Rochelle Walensky trained in a hospital medical unit so tough it was compared to the Marines. It was the mid-'90s, and the AIDS epidemic was still raging. She saw many people die. And then, a few years later, she saw the advent of HIV treatments that could save patients — if those patients could get access to testing and care. Loren Walensky recalls coming home one day to find her sitting at the kitchen table working on extremely complex math. She was starting to broaden her focus from patient care to bigger-picture questions about the increased equity in health care that more funding and optimal treatment choices could bring. ""And it was like a switch went off,"" he says, ""and she just had this natural gift for this style of testing — whether if you did X, would Y happen, and if you did X with a little more money, then how would that affect Y? And all of these if-thens."" She started doing more research, including studies of ways to get more patients tested and treated for AIDS, even in the poorest countries. One of her most prominent papers calculated that HIV drugs had given American patients at least 3 million more years of life. She worked with Dr. Ken Freedberg, a leading expert on how money is best spent in medicine. ""You can't do everything,"" Freedberg says, ""and even if you could, you can't do everything at once. So what Rochelle is particularly good at is understanding data about treatments and public health and costs, and putting those three sets of data together to understand, 'Well, what do we do? And what do we do now?' "" So, if Walensky had a Wonder Woman superpower, it was using data to inform decisions and save lives. That analytic skill has come in handy over the past year, as she has helped lead the pandemic response for her Boston hospital and for the state of Massachusetts. She has weighed in often — and publicly — about coronavirus policy and medicine, speaking to journalists with a natural candor that's contrasted with the stiffer style of some federal officials. Back in April, when a huge surge of COVID-19 cases hit, she didn't deny the pain. ""We are experiencing incredibly sad days,"" she said in an interview in the spring. ""But we sort of face every day with the hope and the vision that what we will be faced with, we can tackle."" And in November, she offered a sobering reality check from the front lines about current COVID-19 medical treatments: ""When I think about the armamentarium of true drugs that we have that benefit people with this disease, it's pretty sparse,"" she said. Walensky kept publishing research on key pandemic topics, such as college testing and antibody treatments. And she weighed in often publicly — on Twitter, in newspapers, and on radio and TV. Asked on CNN whether the Biden plan to get 100 million Americans vaccinated in 100 days could restore a sense of normalcy, she responded with characteristic bluntness — a quality that could cause trouble in these polarized times. ""I told you I'd tell you the truth,"" she said. ""I don't think we're going to feel it then. I think we're still going to have, after we vaccinate 100 million Americans, we're going to have 200 million more that we're going to need to vaccinate."" Walensky is facing a historic challenge, and leading an agency where she's never worked. Already, she's fielded blowback for the new CDC guidance on when and how schools should reopen, and she's openly worried about new, more transmissible variants spreading nationwide. Still, Boston colleagues say they have no doubt she'll succeed in making the transition from leading an infectious diseases division of 300 staffers to a public health agency of about 13,000. ""I would lie down in traffic for her,"" says Elizabeth Barks, the infectious disease division's administrative director at Mass General. ""And I think our entire division would lie down in traffic for her."" Leading and rebuilding the CDC in the midst of a pandemic will be difficult. But Barks and others who know Walensky well say she's clear-eyed and ready to dig in to meet the challenge; she'll try a new approach if first attempts fall short. Walensky brought a plaque from her desk in Boston to CDC headquarters in Atlanta. It reads: ""Hard things are hard."""
npr|Christian nationalism has effectively spread so much disinformation that three in five white evangelicals say Biden was not legitimately elected, according to the American Enterprise Institute.
politico|"COLUMBIA, S.C. — The Biden campaign has always had a healthy sense of impending doom running through it. Maybe it""s the Catholic sensibility of many of the senior staffers, but it""s been noticeable in conversations over the past year. ""The bottom on this whole thing could fall out at any minute,"" one said in December. In February, in the first three nominating contests, the staffer was proved correct. But Wednesday was the start of Lent, and Joe Biden gave up losing. The scale of Biden""s victory in South Carolina was enormous. He went into the contest trailing Bernie Sanders in both total votes cast and delegates. He will leave South Carolina, where turnout exceeded Iowa and New Hampshire combined, with a lead in the popular vote and, according to estimates late Saturday night, about a half-dozen delegates behind Sanders. Biden beat Sanders 48 percent to 20 percent. He won white voters comfortably (33 percent to 23 percent) and crushed Sanders among black voters (61 percent 17 percent). He won voters of every education level. He even beat Sanders among self-identified independents, a core group for the Vermont senator. The victory was powered by an electorate that was more moderate than the first three states. Half of South Carolina voters identified as moderate (41 percent) or conservative (9 percent) and half as somewhat liberal (30 percent) or very liberal (19 percent). But Biden won every group. The victory revealed an important demographic and ideological divide in the Democratic Party: black voters, especially in the South, are a moderating force in the national party. Biden said nobody should count him out until South Carolina""s more diverse electorate had its say, and he was right. It was one of the great comebacks in Democratic primary history. Things were looking so bad for Biden after New Hampshire that many of his natural allies in Washington — the anti-Sanders establishment of current and former elected officials who""ve been on suicide watch for much of the month — were ready to flee to Mike Bloomberg. Then the reality of Bloomberg became clear at the debate in Nevada. Then Biden finished a not-completely-embarrassing second place in the state. He decamped to South Carolina, the early state with the best record of picking both parties' eventual nominees, with a campaign that was broke and near death. In the debate there, Bloomberg was only marginally better, Biden stood out, and Sanders was hit with almost two hours of attacks. The establishment started to coalesce with Jim Clyburn""s Ash Wednesday endorsement of Biden. The resurrection was complete when the networks realized the blowout was overwhelming and called the race as soon as the polls closed at 7 p.m. Sanders, anticipating a repeat of 2016 when he lost to Hillary Clinton 73 percent to 26 percent, fled South Carolina early and, in the end, couldn""t even match his previous percentage. There are six states voting on Super Tuesday with electorates that roughly resemble that of South Carolina (Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia). Sanders lost all of them in 2016. Biden has to be the clear favorite in all except Texas, where Sanders has been polling well and has improved his standing among Latino voters since 2016. Sanders lost California and Massachusetts in 2016, but before Saturday, at least, he was the leader in both states. If there are any polls in the next three days, changes in those three places — Texas, California and Massachusetts — will be a bellwether of how consequential the South Carolina landslide is for Biden. The other states to vote Tuesday — Vermont, Oklahoma, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, and Utah — are likely Sanders strongholds. The Biden comeback seems to set up a very close fight for delegates between the two men, with Bloomberg""s role as a wild card. At Biden""s South Carolina victory party, Clyburn paid tribute to Biden as not necessarily the ideal candidate but the right one for the moment. He quoted Alexis de Tocqueville: America""s ""greatness"" is the ""goodness"" of its people and ""if Americans ever cease to be good, America will cease to be great."" Clyburn""s explanation for Biden""s troubles was that ""people were confusing goodness as weakness."" Instead, he said, it is Biden""s strength. ""This campaign, this year, is about the goodness of America,"" he said tribute. ""And we have as our candidate a real good man."" Biden, for his part, thanked the Democrats in South Carolina who reset his campaign as ""the heart of the Democratic Party."" He chided the ""pundits who declared this candidacy dead"" and took a shot at Sanders as not a real Democrat, an attack that will surely be heard a lot more in the frenetic weeks of voting ahead. It was the first Biden event I""ve attended in this campaign with a genuinely enthusiastic crowd. One especially upbeat supporter was Dick Harpootlian, a famously quotable South Carolina Democrat and a loud Biden backer. He had just finished an interview with Showtime. ""The host says 'fuck' more than I do!"" he said. Harpootlian was simultaneously pumped about the blowout victory and saddened that his state""s — and his own — turn in the spotlight was ending. ""Now you guys won""t talk to me for four years,"" he said. I suggested that he end with a bang. He took a moment like a pitcher winding up and then unloaded on Sanders. ""Tonight exposes the con game that Bernie Sanders is running,"" he said. ""He had 20 or 30 years in the Senate. Where""s all the stuff he""s been promising? Where""s 'Medicare for All'? Where""s free college for everyone? Bernie is nothing but an old cranky conman!"" He paused. ""How""s that?"""
politico|"Joe Biden is certainly feeling rosy. After the dominating make-or-break primary in South Carolina last weekend, Biden scored a series of victories from Super Tuesday voters, who delivered the former vice president another eight states before midnight and staked him to the delegate lead ahead of Bernie Sanders, at least for now. In the days between his turnaround victory on Saturday and Super Tuesday, Biden celebrated in the West: First in Dallas with former Democratic foes Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O""Rourke, and then in California, where he spent the day chatting with diners in Oakland before rallying with supporters in Los Angeles.

politico|"President-elect Joe Biden will inherit one of the weakest labor markets in U.S. history, with record-high unemployment, widening inequality and deteriorating economic conditions. Yet many of the solutions he's offering — massive infrastructure, clean energy and technology investments — will need the approval of a largely hostile Congress. That could undercut one of the central goals of his presidency: to come to the rescue of the nation's ailing workforce, rocked by widespread layoffs during the pandemic shutdowns. A potential crisis will greet him before he even enters the Oval Office: An estimated 12 million people will lose their jobless benefits at the end of the year without another aid package from Congress. There are also early signs that the labor market is backsliding, as the number of people seeking unemployment aid has started to rise again after weeks of declines. Last week, workers filed another 778,000 new applications for jobless benefits, an increase of 30,000 from the previous week, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. More than 20 million people are currently receiving unemployment benefits. ""Biden's going to be very constrained in what kinds of economic policies he's going to be able to legislate,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody""s Analytics. ""Unfortunately, I don't think he's going to have the ability to implement the proposals he's put forward to get us back to full employment more quickly."" After meeting with business and labor leaders on Nov. 16, Biden said an infusion of relief money and a national strategy to address the coronavirus would get the economy revving again after a ""dark winter."" He vowed to create millions of new union jobs through vast spending programs. ""These are the kinds of investments that are going to strengthen our economy and our competitiveness, create millions of jobs, union jobs and doing so, or respect the dignity of work, and empower the voice of workers,"" Biden said. An analysis conducted by Moody""s earlier this year found that if Democrats were able to fully adopt their economic agenda, 18.6 million jobs could be created during Biden""s first term as president, and the economy could return to full employment by the second half of 2022. Biden has also called for raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour from the current $7.25, a change that economists say could shrink gaps in equality in the labor market and boost workers in low-wage jobs — the sector of the economy hit the hardest by the pandemic. But whipping the votes needed to pass those proposals would be tough going in a divided Congress. Even if Democrats win both of the runoff elections in January for U.S. Senate seats in Georgia — a steep climb — the chamber would be tied 50-50, requiring Vice President Kamala Harris to break the deadlock. And some red state Democrats may not be willing to go along with Biden's most ambitious spending plans. House Democrats"" efforts to pass a measure to raise the minimum wage to $15 stirred headwinds within the caucus last year. And that bill was never taken up by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell after it eventually passed the House. Biden""s promises to require all contractors to adhere to collective bargaining agreements on federal projects as part of an infrastructure package would also be a nonstarter for conservatives and would be strongly opposed by the business lobby. ""Biden is going to go into office with an economy that is worse than he and his advisers thought he would have when they wrote up those grandiose policy proposals,"" said Claudia Sahm, who was a senior economist at the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration. ""And with a divided Congress they will be very limited in what they""re able to do,"" she said. ""That agenda is dead on arrival. A 50/50 Senate would not be enough to put through major massive spending."" And more dark clouds are gathering over the economy. Cities and states across the country are weighing new business restrictions, threatening to send the labor market into a deeper spiral even before Biden takes office. California Gov. Gavin Newsom last week ordered widespread closures of indoor dining and gyms following a rapid surge in cases in the state. New York City shuttered the nation""s largest public school system after coronavirus infections climbed to a level not seen since the spring. Getting the economy through the winter without a widely available vaccine and then ""healing scars from the recession"" are going to be ""monumental challenges by any administration,"" said former U.S. Treasury economist Ernie Tedeschi. ""What worries me the most is that we're losing momentum at a time when the U.S. economy is about to enter a very sort of dangerous phase, economically, and in terms of public health,"" Tedeschi added. Even when the economy makes it out of the winter months and flu season, millions of workers who have been unemployed for long periods of time will face new challenges getting hired for a pool of jobs that is expected to stay shallow for some time. ""The labor market is a mess,"" Zandi said. ""One-fifth of the workforce is either unemployed, underemployed or is getting paid less than they did before the pandemic,"" he added. ""That's a very troubled job market."" Nearly a third of the estimated 20 million jobless Americans were defined as ""long-term"" unemployed in October, meaning they were out of a job for more than six months, which can create major consequences for job-seekers, economists say. ""As joblessness spells drag on, workers"" skills erode, they become discouraged, and they""re more likely to face discrimination by potential employers,"" Andrew Stettner and Elizabeth Pancotti wrote in new research released by the progressive Century Foundation. ""Not only are the long-term unemployed more likely to face subsequent periods of unemployment, they face the risk of dropping out of the labor force indefinitely."" Congress pumped trillions of dollars into the economy earlier this year in several March relief packages, providing businesses with forgivable loans and expanding unemployment benefits to help Americans weather shutdown orders throughout the country. Despite the infusion, the economy has only gained back about half of the 22 million jobs lost to the pandemic in March and April. The unemployment rate has been slowly declining since hitting 14.7 percent in April, but it was still sat at 6.9 percent in October, ""which is close to the average peak unemployment rate in recessions since World War II,"" Zandi said. Those who have been hurt the most by the pandemic-induced job losses are minorities and the poorest workers, according to economists, leaving deep scars in the labor market that a Biden administration will have to address. ""People who can least afford the job losses are the ones who've experienced them,"" said Chad Stone, chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""Half of the job losses have been in industries that disproportionately employ ... in the low wage sector. And those are disproportionately Black workers, Hispanic workers and women, who get paid low wages."" ""This is going to be a much trickier thing to solve,"" AFL-CIO chief economist Bill Spriggs said. ""My fear is ... that the scarring will have left us with the Black unemployment rate that is still hovering near double digits. Young people will still be in a horrible job market."""
politico|"Sen. Joe Manchin will endorse Joe Biden for president, putting to bed any thought that he might not support the Democratic presidential nominee this time around. The conservative West Virginia Democrat said in an interview on Thursday that he""s working with Biden, the presumptive nominee, on an endorsement that will come in tandem with a plan to help shield his state from job loss. It""s not a given that Manchin would support Democrats"" presidential platform: He nearly pulled his endorsement from Hillary Clinton in 2016 after she suggested she""d put coal miners out of work, did not support President Barack Obama in 2012 and was recoiling at the thought of Bernie Sanders as Democrats"" nominee this year. But Manchin has been talking to the Biden campaign since the former vice president won South Carolina""s primary, and said he feels comfortable with Biden and his outreach to Appalachia, where energy jobs are a key part of the economy and politics. Asked on Thursday whether he""d endorse Biden, Manchin replied: ""I will, absolutely."" ""I""m just trying to make sure that we""re working through a plan,"" he said. ""I""ve been working and talking to different people. We""re definitely getting there. You just can""t leave people behind that did the heavy lifting and that""s worked hard, whether it""s producing coal or producing energy for this country. They just need an opportunity to live their lives and have that opportunity. And I think Joe Biden understands that."" The move comes during an unmistakable coalescing around Biden after Sanders suspended his campaign. Obama endorsed Biden this week, as did Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), another former 2020 rival."
politico|"CHARLESTON, S.C. — Just as his White House bid appeared to be sputtering to an ugly end, there are signs of life for Joe Biden still. And perhaps more than that. A second-place finish in Nevada, a major endorsement in South Carolina, a strong debate Tuesday and a pair of polls showing him with a staggering lead here have given new hope to his campaign. Money is flowing anew into his war chest, as well as to a super PAC supporting him. Armed with those data points, the campaign and super PAC are telling donors that Biden — given his strength among African-American voters and momentum kicking in at the right time — is quickly emerging as the alternative to frontrunner Bernie Sanders. ""The debate was really a huge turning point,"" said Amanda Loveday, a senior adviser with the PAC and former director of the South Carolina Democratic Party. Donors who had pulled back from Biden, wondering whether Mike Bloomberg would claim the moderate mantle, have started digging into their pockets again, she said. ""That got them off their hands."" And it got rank-and-file voters on their feet. For a campaign that regularly struggles to attract big and energetic crowds, Biden drew something rarely seen at his rally at Coastal Carolina University in Conway on Thursday: a long line of enthusiastic supporters. On Thursday, Biden announced on social media that his campaign raised $1.2 million from nearly 30,000 donors the day after the debate, in which Biden turned in his strongest performance of the 10 encounters with his rivals. Unite the Country, the super PAC backing Biden, would not yet reveal the level of donations coming in but it did purchase digital ads in the six figures. While that's a meager amount compared to how much rival campaigns are spending, Biden's surrogates are confident that a commanding win on Saturday will yield momentum and money. ""I feel confident that Joe Biden will win here by double digits. And he""s going to do well on Super Tuesday,"" said Dick Harpootlian, a key South Carolina organizer for Biden. Harpootlian took it a step further. ""Without Bloomberg in this race, he would sweep Super Tuesday and Bernie would be a distant memory."" Cash-strapped, and with the campaign set to shift to an array of far-flung states, Biden has been more aggressive seeking out earned media. He's made a series of appearances on local and national TV recently, a noticeable shift from when he was the frontrunner and sitting on a bigger war chest. The newest data point boosting Biden is a Monmouth poll showing he has a 20-point lead over Bernie Sanders in South Carolina, 36 percent to 16 percent. The poll, and others like it in South Carolina, was welcome news for a campaign buffeted by three straight losses in a row in the other early states. Those losses had insiders writing his campaign off for dead and Biden and his surrogates repeatedly insisting that he was in the midst of a comeback after last week""s second-place finish in Nevada. A national poll from Fox News, however, was almost the inverse in showing Sanders with 31 percent support to Biden""s 18 percent. But Biden""s campaign said that a big win in South Carolina will change the national polls. His campaign had always planned to use South Carolina as a springboard into the run of Super Tuesday states and beyond to make the case that he does better than any other Democrat with voters of color. But Sanders""s win in Nevada, where he racked up big margins with Latinos, challenged that narrative. Biden""s campaign had always planned to use South Carolina as a springboard into the run of Super Tuesday states and beyond to make the case that he does better than any other Democrat with voters of color. But Sanders""s win in Nevada, where he racked up big margins with Latinos, challenged that narrative. One of the architects of Sanders"" Nevada victory, senior adviser Chuck Rocha, said the Biden campaign""s focus on black voters came almost to the exclusion of Latinos. That gave Sanders an opening with Hispanics, who wield major influence in the two biggest states that vote in March, Texas and California. Rocha also said Colorado, with its mix of white progressives and Latinos, is favorable territory for the campaign on Super Tuesday. ""Bernie Sanders"" multi-racial coalition is very real and equips him the best to win the nomination and beat Trump,"" Rocha said. ""We listened to diverse communities, hired them and invested in them and they delivered."" One of the biggest threats to Biden could be the existence of the two billionaires in the race, Tom Steyer and Bloomberg. Steyer has spent huge sums in South Carolina and, though he""s polling a distant third to Biden, may sap away some of the former vice president""s support and thereby help Sanders, media reports and polling indicate. Polling also shows that Bloomberg in Texas has made the race a tie between Sanders and Biden, but without Steyer in the race, Biden would marginally lead in Texas. ""It""s quite an irony: Bernie""s two biggest benefactors are billionaires,"" said Biden campaign pollster John Anzalone, pointing out that Sanders has built a campaign around demonizing billionaires. A new memo from Unite the Country obtained by POLITICO made the pitch that Bloomberg was standing in Biden""s way. Steve Schale, an adviser to Unite the Country, said the super PAC is focusing heavily on African-American turnout and persuasion in five Super Tuesday states: North Carolina, Virginia, Arkansas, Alabama and Tennessee. More than 75 percent of the delegates in all of the states that vote in March hail from communities where at least 30 percent of the voters are from communities of color, Schale said. ""The biggest challenge facing Joe Biden and our goal of helping him to a big night on March 3rd isn""t Bernie Sanders, or any of the other candidates who have been on the debate stage"" the memo reads. ""Rather, his biggest challenge is the work Michael Bloomberg is doing to divide the moderate vote to the benefit of Bernie Sanders. In fact, today, it is fair to argue that the single best thing Bernie Sanders has going into Super Tuesday is Mayor Bloomberg."" In an interview, Loveday underscored that point. ""A vote for anyone else is a vote for Bernie,"" she said. ""No one else has the trajectory to be the nominee. It will be Joe Biden or it will be Bernie Sanders."""
politico|"The infrastructure plan Joe Biden released Thursday morning is heavy on high-speed rail, transit, biking and other items that Barack Obama championed during his presidency — along with a complete lack of specifics on how he plans to pay for it all. It also differs significantly from President Donald Trump's $1.5 trillion-plus vision for infrastructure, which relies heavily on private-sector investment and about $200 billion in direct federal funds that he proposes be offset by spending cuts in other areas. Here's your cheat sheet to what's inside Biden's new infrastructure push: Like Obama, Biden promises to invest in bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure and build ""complete streets"" that are safe for a variety of transportation modes. Biden also wants to spend $10 billion over 10 years on transit projects in high-poverty areas — an echo of the Obama DOT""s Ladders of Opportunity, a program devoted to using transportation as an engine of social equity. Biden is still a believer in a coast-to-coast, high-speed rail network, despite seeing Obama""s ambitious ""vision"" for a nationwide, high-speed rail network sputter: Florida and Wisconsin rejected federal high-speed rail grants; and California""s high-speed rail program has become a political punching bag and a money pit. Biden""s plan aims to cut travel time between Washington, D.C., and New York City by half, rebuild the Hudson River Tunnel, expand the Northeast Corridor southward, keep plugging away in California and jump-start high-speed rail networks in the Midwest and West. Biden wants to double funding to $3.5 billion a year for two discretionary transportation grant programs created by the Obama administration, and he wouldn""t stop there. He also proposes a new $40 billion, 10-year ""Transformational Projects Fund"" for large and complex projects, grants for cities building electric vehicle charging infrastructure and planning for a future with driverless cars, grants for airport renovations and funding for neighborhoods where highways have cut people off from jobs and amenities. Transportation funding traditionally flows through state DOTs, but Biden""s plan is dotted with references about direct federal funding for cities — a subtle signal to urbanists and sustainability advocates that, like Obama""s DOT, Biden would bypass state highway middlemen to work on distinctly urban projects like light rail, bike lanes and walking routes to school. Biden says ""every cent"" of his $1.3 trillion plan will be paid for with tax increases to the ""super-wealthy and corporations,"" undoing some of the 2017 GOP tax cuts, closing loopholes, ending fossil fuel subsidies and other changes. Such a change would be a break from the traditional model of users paying for infrastructure — a model that has eroded in recent years anyway, as the gas tax has failed to meet the need and the Highway Trust Fund has been shored up repeatedly with general fund transfers. Obama also supported corporate tax changes at the end of his administration, proposing to pay for transportation by taxing overseas corporate profits."
politico|"With his Iowa and New Hampshire thumpings etched into the record books, it""s finally safe to say that Joe Biden's deepest problem as a candidate is that he can neither be taken literally nor seriously. I""m not talking here about Biden""s career-long talent for the gaffe, annotated most recently by Time, the New York Times, New Yorker, POLITICO, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, and just about every other publication. Losing track of his place in a sentence or mistaking which decade he""s talking about in a story or starting to say Afghanistan when he means Ukraine have been embarrassing for Biden, but in no way should they disqualify him from the presidency. Getting lost in a thought is just Joe being Joe and we shouldn""t hold it against him anymore than we should have held sweating against Richard Nixon or lip biting against Bill Clinton. When journalist Salena Zito first noted that Donald Trump""s ability to connect with his followers was based on them taking his outrageous comments seriously as opposed to literally, she captured the essence of his popular appeal. Trump""s followers didn""t mind that their man exaggerated, lied or threatened people in his scattered oratory. Fretting over the surface meaning of his ugliest words was something only literalists—primarily the press corps—concerned themselves with. What galvanized Trump""s followers was the submerged, emotional truths his speeches conveyed. The promise of Biden, some thought as his campaign started, was that his similarly disjointed speaking style would somehow excite a similar vision in the Democratic faithful, stirring a parallel emotional response that would carry him past Trump to victory. But Bidenspeak has proved to be a colossal failure, imparting no punch, either literal or serious, on Democratic voters eager for a uniting figure. Despite his name recognition, pedigree, legislative acumen and campaign cash, Biden finished near the New Hampshire cellar behind Sanders, Buttigieg, Klobachar and Warren with one of the drabbest, most purposeless campaigns since Harold Stassen flew his colors. My gleaning from reviewing Biden""s speeches and interviews is that he seeks to return the nation to 1985 when life was simpler and politics were not so contentious. That""s a great premise for a Fox sitcom, not a presidency. You can scroll through Biden""s position papers until you fry your mouse and still not find anything edgy enough to pull for or push against. It""s a vast river of slow-moving tapioca. A ditto-head of a candidate, Biden has produced no signature issues on which to campaign. He calls for the study of reparations, the boosting of teacher pay and the expansion of debt-relief programs for students in debt. Will somebody pour me a coffee? Joe says yes to gun buybacks, yes to universal background checks, yes to citizenship for ""Dreamers,"" and yes to a capital gains tax increase. Snore. Biden diverges from his fellow candidates on only a couple of substantive issues—new nuclear technologies (let""s try it) and abortion (let""s accept some restrictions)—but neither position is likely to serve as a tentpole for him. The Biden campaign is a three-stage missile that carries no payload. Roaring, crackling and rising on a tail of fire, it landed in the first two states with no real purpose. In the final days of his dismal New Hampshire campaign, the Biden campaign went on the attack, blasting Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders, but the gun was shooting Nerf bullets. The best it could do was mock Buttigieg""s lack of experience and Sanders"" inelectability, unaware, perhaps, that the voters might be repelled by Biden""s experience and all too aware of his own inelectability. Speaking of inelectability, sometimes it seems like Biden has been running for the White House for the past 33 years. Wait a minute. He has been running for the White House for the past 33 years. One would think that having spent eight years in the White House as Barack Obama""s first lieutenant, Biden would have sated his hunger for power. Instead, the position seems to have only enlarged his lust for the top job. As Jeff Greenfield recently wrote in these pages, voters disdain candidates like him and Hillary Clinton and Dan Quayle and Bob Dole and Al Gore and Walter Mondale and Hubert Humphrey who run on the premise that it""s ""their turn"" to be president. But being the ultimate vice president, as you could argue Biden was, isn""t sufficient to promote him to the top job. Voters need a better reason for casting their ballot than, ""I""m Joe Biden; you know me."" So far, Biden hasn""t given it to them. The only campaign muscle that Biden has flexed that the other candidates haven""t is his superhuman capacity for empathy. His personal testimonies of loss and grief, his ability to connect with others who have suffered, are great enough to move even the hardcore cynics in the house. But unless we""re electing a national therapy dog, which we""re not, Biden""s emotional intelligence isn""t a good enough reason to send him to the White House. Biden has worked long and hard in public service and if he needs a prize before he""s willing to take permanent retirement in Delaware, will someone please issue him a plaque and a medal? The saddest thing about the doomed candidacy Biden is piloting is that nobody—outside his family and paid staff—will weep the day it sputters and falls back to earth. ****** Have any of the Delaware banks issued a Biden affinity card? And why not? Send therapy dogs to Shafer.Politico@gmail.com. My email alerts worked on the Quayle for president campaign. My Twitter feed""s least favorite baseball stadium of all time was the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. My RSS feed insists that its turn will return."
politico|"Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Vice President Pence, distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans. This is America""s day. This is democracy""s day. A day of history and hope. Of renewal and resolve. Through a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge. Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy. The will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded. We have learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed. So now, on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence sought to shake this Capitol""s very foundation, we come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries. We look ahead in our uniquely American way — restless, bold, optimistic — and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be. I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here. I thank them from the bottom of my heart. You know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength of our nation. As does President Carter, who I spoke to last night but who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of service. I have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots took — an oath first sworn by George Washington. But the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us. On ""We the People"" who seek a more perfect Union. This is a great nation and we are a good people. Over the centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we have come so far. But we still have far to go. We will press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility. Much to repair. Much to restore. Much to heal. Much to build. And much to gain. Few periods in our nation""s history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we""re in now. A once-in-a-century virus silently stalks the country. It""s taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II. Millions of jobs have been lost. Hundreds of thousands of businesses closed. A cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer. A cry for survival comes from the planet itself. A cry that can""t be any more desperate or any more clear. And now, a rise in political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat. To overcome these challenges – to restore the soul and to secure the future of America – requires more than words. It requires that most elusive of things in a democracy: Unity. Unity. In another January in Washington, on New Year""s Day 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. When he put pen to paper, the President said, ""If my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act and my whole soul is in it."" My whole soul is in it. Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this: Bringing America together. Uniting our people. And uniting our nation. I ask every American to join me in this cause. Uniting to fight the common foes we face: Anger, resentment, hatred. Extremism, lawlessness, violence. Disease, joblessness, hopelessness. With unity we can do great things. Important things. We can right wrongs. We can put people to work in good jobs. We can teach our children in safe schools. We can overcome this deadly virus. We can reward work, rebuild the middle class, and make health care
secure for all. We can deliver racial justice. We can make America, once again, the leading force for good in the world. I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy. I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new. Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, and demonization have long torn us apart. The battle is perennial. Victory is never assured. Through the Civil War, the Great Depression, World War, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and setbacks, our ""better angels"" have always prevailed. In each of these moments, enough of us came together to carry all of us forward. And, we can do so now. History, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity. We can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors. We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature. For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward. And, we must meet this moment as the United States of America. If we do that, I guarantee you, we will not fail. We have never, ever, ever failed in America when we have acted together. And so today, at this time and in this place, let us start afresh. All of us. Let us listen to one another. Hear one another.
See one another. Show respect to one another. Politics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn""t have to be a cause for total war. And, we must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured. My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this. America has to be better than this. And, I believe America is better than this. Just look around. Here we stand, in the shadow of a Capitol dome that was completed amid the Civil War, when the Union itself hung in the balance. Yet we endured and we prevailed. Here we stand looking out to the great Mall where Dr. King spoke of his dream. Here we stand, where 108 years ago at another inaugural, thousands of protestors tried to block brave women from marching for the right to vote. Today, we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in American history elected to national office – Vice President Kamala Harris. Don""t tell me things can""t change. Here we stand across the Potomac from Arlington National Cemetery, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace. And here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, and to drive us from this sacred ground. That did not happen. It will never happen. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever. To all those who supported our campaign I am humbled by the faith you have placed in us. To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. And if you still disagree, so be it. That""s democracy. That""s America. The right to dissent peaceably, within the guardrails of our Republic, is perhaps our nation""s greatest strength. Yet hear me clearly: Disagreement must not lead to disunion. And I pledge this to you: I will be a President for all Americans. I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did. Many centuries ago, Saint Augustine, a saint of my church, wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love. What are the common objects we love that define us as Americans? I think I know. Opportunity. Security. Liberty. Dignity. Respect. Honor. And, yes, the truth. Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is truth and there are lies. Lies told for power and for profit. And each of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders – leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation — to defend the truth and to defeat the lies. I understand that many Americans view the future with some fear and trepidation. I understand they worry about their jobs, about taking care of their families, about what comes next. I get it. But the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting those who don""t look like you do, or worship the way you do, or don""t get their news from the same sources you do. We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts. If we show a little tolerance and humility. If we""re willing to stand in the other person""s shoes just for a moment.
Because here is the thing about life: There is no accounting for what fate will deal you. There are some days when we need a hand. There are other days when we""re called on to lend one. That is how we must be with one another. And, if we are this way, our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future. My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us, we will need each other. We will need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter. We are entering what may well be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus. We must set aside the politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation. I promise you this: as the Bible says weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning. We will get through this, together The world is watching today. So here is my message to those beyond our borders: America has been tested and we have come out stronger for it. We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again. Not to meet yesterday""s challenges, but today""s and tomorrow""s. We will lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example. We will be a strong and trusted partner for peace, progress, and security. We have been through so much in this nation. And, in my first act as President, I would like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those we lost this past year to the pandemic. To those 400,000 fellow Americans – mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, friends, neighbors, and co-workers. We will honor them by becoming the people and nation we know we can and should be. Let us say a silent prayer for those who lost their lives, for those they left behind, and for our country. Amen. This is a time of testing. We face an attack on democracy and on truth. A raging virus. Growing inequity. The sting of systemic racism. A climate in crisis. America""s role in the world. Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways. But the fact is we face them all at once, presenting this nation with the gravest of responsibilities. Now we must step up. All of us. It is a time for boldness, for there is so much to do. And, this is certain. We will be judged, you and I, for how we resolve the cascading crises of our era. Will we rise to the occasion? Will we master this rare and difficult hour? Will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world for our children? I believe we must and I believe we will. And when we do, we will write the next chapter in the American story. It""s a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me. It""s called ""American Anthem"" and there is one verse stands out for me: ""The work and prayers
of centuries have brought us to this day
What shall be our legacy?
What will our children say?...
Let me know in my heart
When my days are through
America
America
I gave my best to you."" Let us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our nation. If we do this then when our days are through our children and our children""s children will say of us they gave their best. They did their duty. They healed a broken land.
My fellow Americans, I close today where I began, with a sacred oath. Before God and all of you I give you my word. I will always level with you. I will defend the Constitution. I will defend our democracy. I will defend America. I will give my all in your service thinking not of power, but of possibilities. Not of personal interest, but of the public good. And together, we shall write an American story of hope, not fear. Of unity, not division. Of light, not darkness. An American story of decency and dignity. Of love and of healing. Of greatness and of goodness. May this be the story that guides us. The story that inspires us. The story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history. We met the moment. That democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch but thrived. That our America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world. That is what we owe our forebearers, one another, and generations to follow. So, with purpose and resolve we turn to the tasks of our time. Sustained by faith. Driven by conviction. And, devoted to one another and to this country we love with all our hearts. May God bless America and may God protect our troops. Thank you, America."
politico|"Former Vice President Joe Biden released a plan Friday to strengthen labor unions. Biden""s proposal would, among other things, give employees more leverage to organize in the workplace, raise the hourly minimum wage to $15 and make it harder for businesses to classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees. Biden""s plan would build on proposals already introduced by House Democrats and would resurrect several Obama-era policies. Biden supports Democratic legislation that would allow employees to unionize by ""card check"" — the informal collection of authorization forms from a majority within a proposed bargaining unit. Current law gives employers the right to require a formal secret-ballot election overseen by the National Labor Relations Board; Biden""s plan would make card-check the default method, something that unions have long sought. Biden supports the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, H.R. 2474 (116), which would, among other things, enhance the National Labor Relations Board's power by allowing it to levy punitive fines against employers who violate labor laws; today, the agency is permitted only to collect back pay. House Education and Labor Chairman Bobby Scott (D-Va.) has called the PRO Act ""the most comprehensive legislation in recent history to strengthen workers' right to organize and bargain for higher wages, better benefits and safer working conditions."" Businesses oppose the bill, arguing that it would give unions too much power. Biden pledges to form a ""cabinet-level working group"" with representatives from labor unions that would, in the first 100 days of his administration, deliver a plan to ""dramatically increase union density and address economic inequality."" In addition, Biden supports Democratic bills that would establish minimum collective bargaining rights for public-sector employees and would would revive an Obama-era rule requiring additional disclosures for union-busting activities by management. (Biden might find it difficult to keep the latter promise, given that the rule was blocked by a federal judge in 2016.) Biden says he would work with Congress to write a stricter law on employee misclassification, the practice of classifying a worker an independent contractor rather than an employee in order to avoid providing various mandatory benefits. Biden's bill mirrors one recently signed into law by California Gov. Gavin Newsom that could dramatically change large sections of the ""gig economy,"" such as Uber and Lyft. Biden would also curb the imposition in employee contracts of non-compete clauses and mandatory arbitration agreements that prevent workers from suing their employers for misdeeds such as sexual harassment. Biden says he would restore and possibly expand an Obama-era rule that would have extended overtime eligibility to an additional 4.2 million workers. That regulation was enjoined by a federal court in Texas shortly before it was to take effect in December 2016. The Trump administration substituted a rule expanding overtime eligibility to 1.3 million workers. Biden would increase the number of Labor Department employees who investigate wage theft, worker safety violations and worker misclassification. He would also require government contractors to pledge neutrality on employee unionization efforts, to pay $15 an hour and to provide ""family sustaining benefits."" Biden would impose a national ban on state right-to-work laws, which prevent unions from collecting ""fair-share"" fees from union non-members to cover their share of the costs of collective bargaining. Like most of the candidates"" labor plans, Biden""s depends mainly on changes to the law, some of which Democrats have been seeking since passage of the anti-union Taft-Hartley Act in 1947. But changes to federal contracting and overtime requirements could be done administratively without approval from Congress. Biden""s labor plan largely aligns with that of other candidates, with a couple of notable omissions. There is no section on paid family leave; Biden has said he supports it generally, but he's rarely discussed it on the campaign trail. And he has no proposal to narrow or close the gender wage gap. Sen. Kamala Harris, by contrast, released an entire plan on equal pay, as did South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Eleanor Mueller and Rebecca Rainey contributed to this report."
axios|"Joe Biden is unlikely to pursue a carbon tax if he wins in November, according to several people familiar with his campaign's thinking. Driving the news: The campaign said last year it supported a price on carbon emissions, but it has since released policies that embody government mandates, investments and job creation amid the pandemic-induced recession. What they""re saying: The campaign""s positioning reflects the Democratic Party""s overall movement away from a carbon price and a new focus on economic recovery and equality, say people following the presidential nominee""s positions. For the record: Biden campaign spokesperson Matt Hill declined to comment. Public information about the nominee""s positions compel some reading between the lines. The big picture: Most economists and businesses support an explicit carbon price over standards or other policies. They argue it""s the most straightforward and predictable way to cut heat-trapping emissions. The other side: A growing list of corporations and lobbying interests have poured money into carbon tax campaigns on Capitol Hill in recent years, but these efforts have not produced public results. What we""re watching: If Democrats take control of the Senate, its leaders could pursue a carbon tax, opening up a narrow path for congressional bargaining that Biden could back as president.

Driving the news: Biden was asked about these situations after delivering remarks about how to open school safely in light of the coronavirus pandemic. It comes during a week in which he's been out on the trail countering Trump's attacks about violence and unrest in America. What they're saying: ""I think we should let the judicial system work its way,"" Biden said when asked by a reporter if he agrees with his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, that the officers who shot Blake and Taylor should be charged. Between the lines: President Trump has not called for charges against the officers in either the Blake or Taylor cases, but condemned the Portland shooting as ""disgraceful."" On Monday, he defended the 17-year-old supporter of his who shot and killed two people in Kenosha, Wisconsin, suggesting that he was acting in self-defense. The big picture: Biden reiterated his belief that ""the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable women and men. They pin on that shield every morning and they have a right to go home that night safely. ... They're the ones that want to get rid of the bad cops more than anyone else does, because it reflects on them."""
axios|"Joe Biden is facing growing scrutiny over sexual assault allegations made by a former Senate staffer. The big picture: Business Insider last week published two on-the record corroborations of parts of allegations by Tara Reade, who claims Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993. The former vice president then appeared on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" to publicly deny the allegations for the first time. April 3, 2019: Reade joined several women in accusing Biden of inappropriate touching as a senator in 1993. She told The Union, a local newspaper in California, that on numerous occasions Biden put his hands on her neck and shoulders in ways that made her uncomfortable. March 25, 2020: Reade told journalist Katie Halper on a podcast that in 1993, Biden pinned her against a wall in a Senate building, reached under her clothes and penetrated her with his fingers while kissing her. April 9: Reade filed a police report claiming she was the victim of a sexual assault in 1993. She tweeted that she did so solely for ""safety reasons,"" acknowledging that the statute of limitations had run out on her complaint. April 12-13: The New York Times, Washington Post and AP all published investigations into Reade's allegations. April 24: The Intercept reported that Reade's mother called into CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Aug. 11, 1993, and said her daughter had just left her job working for a ""prominent senator"" in Washington, where she ""could not get through with her problems at all."" April 27: Two sources went on the record to Business Insider to corroborate certain details of Reade's allegation. April 30: Reade told Fox News she filed a complaint to the Senate personnel office almost 30 years ago. Reade said the complaint would prove that she went to top Biden aides to discuss her problems with the then-senator, and that they have since lied about their recollections of those conversations. May 1: Biden personally addressed the allegations for the first time on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" saying ""They aren""t true. This never happened."" May 2: Reade told the AP that she filed a ""limited"" report on Biden with a congressional personnel office that did not explicitly accuse him of sexual harassment or assault. May 4: The Secretary of the Senate said it cannot comply with Biden's request to release documents pertaining to Reade's alleged 1993 complaint. The office said it ""has no discretion to disclose"" the information because of laws pertaining to confidentiality. For the record: The Biden campaign has strongly denied all of Reade's allegations in statements provided to media organizations: May 7: Asked whether Biden should drop out in an excerpt of an interview with Megyn Kelly, Reade said: ""I wish he would,"" adding it's ""a little late"" for an apology. May 22: Lawyer Douglas Wigdor, whose firm has represented plaintiffs in high-profile discrimination cases, announced that he was no longer representing Reade."
axios|"Joe Biden announced Tuesday that he has chosen Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) as his running mate. Why it matters: It's a historic pick. Harris is both the first Black woman and first Asian American woman to be named to a major-party U.S. presidential ticket, and potentially the first woman vice president if Biden defeats President Trump. The big picture: Harris was probably the safest choice Biden could have made among his running mate finalists. She has a national profile and experience with elected office, was vetted and tested in the Democratic presidential primaries and can boost Biden's fundraising. What he's saying: ""I need someone working alongside me who is smart, tough, and ready to lead. Kamala is that person,"" Biden announced in a statement. Harris tweeted after the news broke: ""Joe Biden can unify the American people because he's spent his life fighting for us. And as president, he'll build an America that lives up to our ideals. I'm honored to join him as our party's nominee for Vice President, and do what it takes to make him our Commander-in-Chief."" What's next: Biden's campaign said he and Harris will deliver remarks in Wilmington, Delaware, on Wednesday on ""working together to restore the soul of the nation and fight for working families to move the country forward."" Between the lines: The pick gives Biden a running mate with strong prosecutorial skills, as Harris has proven at Senate hearings and during her strongest debate moments. That could help them make the case against Trump in the fall. The backstory: Harris, who at 55 is more than 20 years younger than Biden, was born to an Indian mother and Jamaican father who immigrated to California. She had been seen as a front-runner when she announced her presidential campaign in January 2019, but she was never able to capitalize on the early momentum — except for a brief spike in public attention after her confrontation with Biden over federally mandated school busing at a June debate. As a presidential candidate, Harris campaigned on a $500-a-month tax credit that she called ""the largest working and middle-class tax cut in a generation."" She started out as a supporter of Medicare for All, but then switched to an alternative that would have preserved a role for private insurance. Harris has also faced some criticisms based on cases she argued and policies she enacted as California's attorney general: Reality check: It will be Biden who sets the policies if he wins — but Harris' record will be relevant if she's elected vice president, especially if she takes ownership of specific issues and projects as Biden did when he was Barack Obama's vice president. What to watch: Harris' speech accepting the nomination at the Democratic convention will be her chance to introduce herself to an audience of general election voters — and to show how well she and Biden will be able to work as a team.

axios|"Joe Biden is considering asking Congress to help suffering Americans in two steps: give them the balance of their coveted $2,000 coronavirus payments, followed by a $3 trillion tax and infrastructure package. Why it matters: Biden is confident he can get multiple packages through Congress after Democrats won both Georgia Senate elections. The president-elect's team also wants to get cash in Americans' hands as quickly as possible, according to people familiar with the matter. The big picture: In July Biden rolled out his Build Back Better plan, which includes billions of dollars for caregivers, incentives for manufacturers and some $2 trillion for green jobs and infrastructure spending. Democrats are concerned that if they miss early opportunities to combat COVID and reverse its broader effect on the economy, the twin problems could cripple the rest of Biden""s presidency. Reverting to Plan A: Biden is essentially dusting off his pre-election plans, back when many of his economic and political advisers assumed that if he won the presidency, he would carry the Senate along with him. Be smart: Biden""s blitz for a quick spending measure could allow him to build goodwill with Senate Republicans for a bigger package in the spring, especially if it includes liability protection the GOP wants for businesses fearing coronavirus lawsuits. Editor's note: This story has been corrected to note that Biden's Build Back Better plan includes $2 trillion for green jobs and infrastructure spending, not $4 trillion."
axios|"Foreign policy will look drastically different if Joe Biden defeats President Trump in November, advisers tell Axios — starting with a Day One announcement that the U.S. is re-entering the Paris Climate Agreement and new global coordination of the coronavirus response. The big picture: If Trump's presidency started the ""America First"" era of withdrawal from global alliances, Biden's team says his presidency would be the opposite: a re-engagement with the world and an effort to rebuild those alliances — fast. Driving the news: Biden advisers who watched the 2008-09 financial crisis consume Obama""s early days say that, similarly, the domestic challenges posed by the coronavirus will demand much of the next administration""s attention while the global impacts may compete with other priorities. But the coronavirus is just the beginning. Biden's advisers look at the world they could inherit and feel a sense of dread and urgency in every time zone: Climate change, Iran""s breakout time for a nuclear weapon, North Korea""s missile advancement, a revanchist Russia and an assertive China. Don't forget: In July 2008, Obama did a world tour promising to end the Bush administration's foreign policy approach and embrace multilateralism. Our thought bubble: The core Biden foreign policy team served in the Obama administration. Between the lines: Biden and Obama had several serious policy differences. In some cases, Biden played devil's advocate to help Obama arrive at a decision, but there were some genuine divergences. Though Biden's policies would be quite different from Trump's, his team may embrace a tactic that Trump also favors when trying to achieve major strategic goals: Overwhelm the circuits and push on multiple fronts at once."
axios|"Advisers to President Trump say Joe Biden is the Democrat he most fears running against, and that Pennsylvania is the state he worries most about flipping against him. Trump""s calculation is based partly on how weak he sees other Democratic possibilities, including Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, and partly on who""s capable of appealing to his base of working class whites. Trump advisers say Biden, like the president, conveys authenticity, is comfortable in his own skin, can work a crowd, and relishes throwing and returning punches. A Democratic source close to Biden said he'd be strong with ""Obama-Trump voters"" in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin where ""the blue wall became the red threat"" — Obama won them twice, then they flipped narrowly to Trump. Republican sources tell me Pennsylvania, where Trump campaigned frequently and fervently in 2016, will be the toughest to hold of all the battleground states that put him in office. Be smart: Trump told ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Jeff Glor just after the Singapore summit: ""I dream about Biden. That's a dream. ... I'd love to have it be Biden."" What Trump meant was ""wouldn't."""
axios|"Former Vice President and 2020 Democratic hopeful Joe Biden on Wednesday played down growing concerns that China is on the verge of surpassing the U.S. as a dominant global economic and national security superpower, saying: ""They're not competition for us."" Our thought bubble, per Axios' Joe Uchill: While Biden may be right that resource management could cap China's potential, that hasn't stopped the country from stealing billions of dollars in intellectual property through cyber and other means, providing stiff competition in tech fields — in part, due to stolen intellectual property — and investing threatening amounts in emerging fields like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. In telecom equipment, China has 2 of the top 5 companies in the world, with Huawei being No. 1. Axios' National Political Reporter Jonathan Swan weighed in as well saying Biden""s is not a view shared by leaders of either party in Washington, or by national security leaders. One of the rare things Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and President Trump agree on is that China is a rising, increasingly urgent threat to the U.S. The context: Biden has made similar comments before. At a Democratic campaign event in Florida in October 2018, Biden said the U.S. is ""better positioned than any nation in the world to own the 21st century,"" adding that China is ""a divided country in 1,000 ways ... Don't tell me China's going to own America. It's not possible."" Go deeper: China is the greatest, growing threat to America"
axios|"Former Vice President Joe Biden launched a virtual newsletter and announced a new podcast on Wednesday to remain in touch with supporters amid the novel coronavirus pandemic. Why it matters: Biden's move illustrates that if you can""t get the media to pay attention to you, instead be the media, per Axios' Sara Fischer. Sen. Bernie Sanders has deployed a similar strategy with his own campaign video series. The big picture: Biden shifted to remote campaigning to cooperate with social distancing mandates, canceling rallies and allowing his staff to telework. He wrote in Wednesday's emailed newsletter that he hopes to ""send it out regularly"" and that ""it can help us stay connected."" Biden has also begun hosting virtual press briefings. He spoke at a virtual town hall Wednesday morning and noted that Democrats have ""had enough debates"" and the party ""should get on with this."" The state of play: Biden is the presumed Democratic nominee since racking up delegates in state primary contests. But lone 2020 competitor Sanders has indicated he doesn't plan on dropping out anytime soon, saying Tuesday that he plans to partake in the April Democratic primary debate."
axios|"Senate Democrats are readying to pass President Biden""s infrastructure package through the budget reconciliation process, a recognition they're unlikely to get much Republican support for a potential $2 trillion package. Driving the news: Sen. Bernie Sanders told Axios on Tuesday he""s consulted with the White House about how to prepare for the next round of spending, and he's ready to do it immediately via reconciliation — a process he controls as chair of the Senate Budget Committee. Why it matters: The current $1.9 trillion COVID stimulus package, the first of the Democrats' three potential chances to use reconciliation, could be the easiest. What they're saying: ""We need to address the economic crisis facing working families, and a second reconciliation bill will go a long way to beginning that process,"" Sanders said. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) told Axios he also anticipates Democrats will need to do infrastructure via reconciliation. The other side: Republicans dismiss the infrastructure bill as cover for a ""radical"" climate change proposal and question how the government can afford it."
usa_today|"NEW LONDON, Connecticut — President Joe Biden is scheduled to deliver the keynote address during this month's graduation ceremonies at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. The address, scheduled for May 19, will be the second time Biden has addressed a graduating class at the academy. He served as the keynote speaker in 2013 while serving as vice president. This will be Biden's first commencement address to a military service academy as commander in chief and his first official visit to Connecticut as president. ""It will be a memorable event for our community, as well as a great opportunity to showcase the academy and the city of New London on a national stage,"" Rear Adm. Bill Kelly, the academy's superintendent, said in a statement. Presidents deliver commencement speeches to the U.S. military academies on a rotating schedule. Lyndon Johnson was the first president to speak at a Coast Guard graduation, speaking to cadets in 1964. Harry Truman made the first presidential visit to the Coast Guard Academy in 1952. A president last addressed the Coast Guard Academy graduating class in 2017, when President Donald Trump spoke. The commencement exercises will be closed to the public and the number of guests will be greatly reduced from previous years as part of restrictions put in place because of the pandemic, school officials said. Those attending will be asked wear masks and be socially distanced, academy officials said."
usa_today|"It's a new month, OnPolitics readers. But the GOP is still figuring out an old problem: How to move forward in a post-Trump era. Plus, our Washington correspondent Ledge King has the details on West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin's influence of power in Washington. It's Mabinty, with the news of the day. Is it possible to be respected by both sides of the aisle – and former president Donald Trump? Manchin sure seems to be close. ""I talk to everybody. I have dinner with everybody. If I can find a pathway forward, we""re going to find it. You can""t find it unless you know people and unless you truly want to be a friend and want to work in an honest way, not a gotcha moment,"" the senator told USA TODAY in an exclusive interview. Republicans applaud Manchin for tapping the brakes on massive legislation March's COVID-19 relief bill and Biden's proposed $2.25 trillion infrastructure bill. Democrats see Manchin as an impediment to the nation's necessary development. But voting record aside, his support keeps the party in the majority (with Vice President Kamala Harris casting tie-breaking votes). Manchin's big moments Since January, Manchin has been instrumental in killing a plan to raise the federal hourly minimum wage to $15 (he wanted $11) and limiting wealthier households from receiving payments in the COVID-19 relief bill. As chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, he stands in the way of Biden's ambitious climate change proposals to cut fossil fuel emissions and end subsidies for coal and oil. Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney called former President Donald Trump's election fraud falsehood a ""big lie"" on Monday and slammed fellow Republicans for perpetuating it. ""The 2020 presidential election was not stolen. Anyone who claims it was is spreading THE BIG LIE, turning their back on the rule of law, and poisoning our democratic system,"" the GOP caucus chair tweeted. Cheney could be in danger of losing her position as leader of the GOP caucus due to her continued outspoken criticism of the former president, in a split from colleagues who have remained loyal to his false claims about the 2020 election being stolen.

usa_today|"When President Joe Biden makes his first address to the joint session of Congress on Wednesday, it will look a lot different than speeches made by his predecessors. The address, which technically is not called the State of the Union, will be the first time a U.S. president speaks to both houses of Congress since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, as former President Donald Trump delivered his last State of the Union on Feb. 4, 2020. COVID-19 precautions are the main reason why Biden's speech will come near his 100th day in office after receiving the invitation to do so from Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi on April 13. It will be the first time a president will do the annual address in the month of April and the latest in the year since former President Calvin Coolidge in December 1923. Social distancing guidelines mean only 200 people will be allowed in the House chambers instead of the 1,400 people allowed in past years. Five guests will be invited virtually, breaking the tradition of people sitting alongside the first lady in her viewing box. Six guests were invited by the Trumps in 2017 and 11 in 2020. All people inside the chamber will be required to wear masks, and Biden will be masked as he makes the traditional walk down the center aisle to the rostrum but will take his mask off during his speech. History will be made once Biden begins his speech as he will have two women behind him —  Pelosi and Vice President Kamala Harris. Pelosi became the first woman to sit behind the podium in 2007 during former President George W. Bush's address. In wake of the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, Biden""s address has been designated a National Special Security Event, meaning the Secret Service will oversee much of the planning. The Department of Defense, U.S. Capitol Police and other area law enforcement will also provide security to the event. Since some members of Congress and the Supreme Court will not be present or seated in the House gallery for the address, there will be no ""designated survivor"" assigned for the event. Done in the event a major catastrophe kills the people in the House chambers, former Interior Secretary David Bernhardt was assigned the role in 2020.

usa_today|"The trial of ex-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd last month raised civil rights activists' hopes of a turning point in accountability for law enforcement. But as Chauvin was being tried, police in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, fatally shot 20-year-old Daunte Wright, while police in Chicago shot and killed 13-year-old Adam Toledo. Just minutes before Chauvin was found guilty, a police officer in Columbus, Ohio, shot and killed 16-year-old Ma'Khia Bryant. The contrast between President Joe Biden's promises and the reality of police reform points to the difficulty of balancing the need for urgency with a desire for broad and deep changes to policing in America, particularly among marginalized communities. On the campaign trail, candidate Biden proposed creating a national police oversight commission within the first 100 days of his presidency. The 100-day milestone passed last week, but the commission still has not launched. In delaying the commission, domestic policy adviser Susan Rice said the administration took advice from activist groups like the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. ""Based on close, respectful consultation with partners in the civil rights community, the administration made the considered judgment that a police commission, at this time, would not be the most effective way to deliver on our top priority in this area, which is to sign the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act into law,"" Rice said in a statement. Wade Henderson, the interim president and CEO of the Leadership Conference, said in a statement he agreed with the White House decision to forgo a commission. A representative for the NAACP LDF declined to comment. A White House official said civil rights groups were concerned that a commission would take too long to establish and could undermine momentum for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, first introduced in Congress months after Chauvin was arrested last May for kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes, even after Floyd lost consciousness. The bill was reintroduced in February, passed in the House in March and now faces a divided Senate. Activists also felt the commission would take months to get off the ground and too closely resemble commissions launched by former Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama. Instead, the administration has thrown its full weight behind the Floyd act. During his first address to a joint session of Congress last week, Biden called on lawmakers to pass police reform by the anniversary of Floyd's death. ""We have to come together to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve, to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system and enact police reform in George Floyd's name,"" Biden said. ""Let's get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd's death."" Black leaders in the House and Senate have led negotiations on finalizing the bill for a Senate vote. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., said legislative language could be finalized by May 25, the anniversary of Floyd's death. ""I""m very optimistic that we""ll get it on President Biden""s desk,"" Bass said last month. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J, who sponsored a Senate version of the 2020 bill, said talks are still underway after the Chauvin verdict. ""We""re having good conversations, (with) good faith people,"" said Booker. Sen Tim Scott, R-S.C., the Senate's only Black Republican, recently said a compromise on the bill could be finalized soon. Scott's Just and Unifying Solutions to Invigorate Communities Everywhere, or JUSTICE Act, introduced last June, was blocked by Democrats for neglecting reforms like eliminating qualified immunity – a legal doctrine that protects officers from civil action. More:What if there isn't a video? For families of people killed by police, it's 'not a fair fight' The Floyd act would limit qualified immunity and lower criminal intent standards. The act would also establish a national registry on police misconduct, among other provisions. Biden's Justice Department appointees have already begun making changes. Under Attorney General Merrick Garland, the DOJ launched an investigation into the operations of the Minneapolis police department a day after Chauvin's conviction. Garland also overturned a Trump-era policy limiting consent decrees that can help reform local police departments. Last week, Justice Department officials announced a wide-ranging investigation into civil rights abuses by the Louisville Metro Police Department. Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was killed when Louisville officers entered her apartment on a ""no-knock"" warrant last March. Taylor was unarmed. One officer, Brett Hankison, was indicted on first-degree wanton endangerment for shooting into a neighboring apartment but was not charged for killing Taylor. The Justice Department also indicted three white men responsible for the 2020 shooting death of Black jogger Ahmaud Arbery on hate crime charges last week. The men were charged with murder and aggravated assault in Georgia, where Arbery was killed. DOJ has experience in Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, former CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights,  who oversaw investigations into police departments in Ferguson, Missouri; Baltimore; and Chicago when she served as acting chief of Obama's Civil Rights Division at DOJ. Amid these movements, there has been no let-up in high-profile killings of people of color – including teenagers – by law enforcement. In April, North Carolina deputies fatally shot Andrew Brown, Jr, a 42-year-old Black man, in Elizabeth City while attempting to execute drug-related search and arrest warrants. Officers fired on Brown as he drove away from his home. The FBI launched an investigation into the shooting. Adam Toledo, a Hispanic 13-year-old, was shot by a Chicago police officer on March 29 after raising his apparently empty hands in the air. Police initially said the boy was armed before video of the encounter was released to the public. Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, was shot by a Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, police officer during a traffic stop. Former officer Kim Potter later quit the force and was arrested and charged with second-degree manslaughter. Bryant, 16, was shot by Columbus, Ohio, police officer Nicholas Reardon after attacking two women with what appeared to be a kitchen knife, according to video of the incident. ""How do you justify murdering a (16-year-old)? How do justify that? That is a child,"" Heather Johnson, a 32-year-old activist and mother of six from Columbus told USA TODAY. ""There is never a reason to justify Columbus police officers murdering our children.""

usa_today|"Wednesday night, approaching his 100th day in office, President Joe Biden addresses the joint session of Congress for the first time. The full text of his prepared speech below was released by the White House. Madame Speaker. Madame Vice President. No president has ever said those words from this podium, and it""s about time. The First Lady. The Second Gentleman. Mr. Chief Justice. Members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet – and distinguished guests. My fellow Americans, While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is very different – a reminder of the extraordinary times we are in. Throughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to the Congress, to the nation, and to the world. To declare war. To celebrate peace. To announce new plans and possibilities. Tonight, I come to talk about crisis — and opportunity. About rebuilding our nation — and revitalizing our democracy. And winning the future for America. As I stand here tonight — just one day shy of the 100th day of my administration. 100 days since I took the oath of office, lifted my hand off our family Bible, and inherited a nation in crisis. The worst pandemic in a century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again. Turning peril into possibility. Crisis into opportunity. Setback into strength. Life can knock us down. But in America, we never stay down. In America, we always get up. And today, that""s what we""re doing: America is rising anew. Choosing hope over fear. Truth over lies. Light over darkness. After 100 Days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff. We are working again. Dreaming again. Discovering again. Leading the world again. We have shown each other and the world: There is no quit in America. 100 days ago, America""s house was on fire. We had to act. And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Schumer – and with the overwhelming support of the American people – Democrats, Independents, and Republicans – we did act. Together — we passed the American Rescue Plan. One of the most consequential rescue packages in American history. We""re already seeing the results. After I promised 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in 100 days – we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in 100 days. We""re marshalling every federal resource. We""ve gotten the vaccine to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 community health centers. We""re setting up community vaccination sites, and are deploying mobile units into hard-to-reach areas. Today, 90% of Americans now live within 5 miles of a vaccination site. Everyone over the age of 16, everyone – is now eligible and can get vaccinated right away. So get vaccinated now. When I was sworn in, less than 1% of seniors were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. 100 days later, nearly 70% of seniors are fully protected. Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80% since January. Down 80%. And, more than half of all adults in America have gotten at least one shot. At a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse what it""s like. She looked and said every shot feels like a dose of hope. A dose of hope for the educator in Florida who has a child who suffers from an auto-immune disease. She wrote to me that she was worried about bringing the virus home. When she got vaccinated, she sat in her car and just cried. Cried out of joy, cried out of relief. Parents are seeing smiles on their kids"" faces as they go back to school because teachers and school bus drivers, cafeteria workers have been vaccinated. Grandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing their hands against a window to say goodbye. It means everything to both of them. There""s still more work to do to beat this virus. We can""t let our guard down now. But tonight, I can say because of you — the American people – our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history is one of the greatest logistical achievements our country has ever seen. What else have we done these first 100 days? We kept our commitment and we are sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85% of all American households. We""ve already sent more than 160 million checks out the door. It""s making a difference. For many people, it""s making all the difference in the world. A single mom in Texas wrote to me. She said when she couldn""t work, this relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction. A grandmother in Virginia told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor — something she put off for months because she didn""t have the money. One of the defining images of this crisis has been cars lined up for miles waiting for a box of food to be put in the trunk. Did you ever think you""d see that in America? That""s why the American Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger – and hunger is down sharply already. We""re also providing: Rental assistance to keep people from being evicted from their homes. Providing loans to keep small businesses open and their employees on the job. During these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act because I established a special sign up period to do that. We""re making one of the largest one-time investments ever in improving health care for veterans. Critical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we are on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year. In the process, the economy created more than 1.3 million new jobs in 100 days. More new jobs in the first 100 days than any president on record. The International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6% this year. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades. America is moving. Moving forward. And we can""t stop now. We""re in a competition with China and other countries to win the 21st Century. We have to do more than just build back. We have to build back better. Throughout our history, public investments and infrastructure have transformed America. The transcontinental railroad and interstate highways united two oceans and brought us into a totally new age of progress. Universal public school and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity. Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon and now to Mars, discovered vaccines, and gave us the Internet and so much more. These are the investments we make together, as one country, and that only government can make. Time and again, they propel us into the future. That""s why I proposed The American Jobs Plan — a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself. The largest jobs plan since World War II. It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure. Jobs modernizing roads, bridges and highways. Jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors and transit lines. It""s clean water. Today, up to 10 million homes and more than 400,000 schools and child care centers have pipes with lead in them, including for drinking water. A clear and present danger to our children""s health. The American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100% of the nation""s lead pipes and service lines so every American, so every child – can turn on the faucet and be certain to drink clean water. It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed internet, including 35% of rural Americans who still don""t have it. This will help our kids and businesses succeed in a 21st Century economy. And I am asking the Vice President to help lead this effort. It creates jobs by building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, and catastrophic failures – with tragic results as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during winter storms. The American Jobs Plan will create jobs to lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid. The American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and their careers. 2 million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic, too often because they couldn""t get the care they need for their family, their children. 800,000 families are on a Medicaid waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability. This plan will help these families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits. For too long, we have failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis. Jobs. Jobs. For me, when I think about climate change, I think jobs. The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy efficient buildings and homes. Electrical workers installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways. Farmers planting cover crops, so they can reduce carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it. There""s no reason the blades for wind turbines can""t be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason why American workers can""t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. The American Jobs Plan will create millions of good paying jobs – jobs Americans can raise their families on. And all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: ""Buy American."" American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America that create American jobs. The way it should be. Now – I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you. You feel left behind and forgotten in an economy that""s rapidly changing. Let me speak directly to you. Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in economic growth for years to come. These are good-paying jobs that can""t be outsourced. Nearly 90% of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree. 75% do not require an associate""s degree. The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America. And, it recognizes something I""ve always said. Wall Street didn""t build this country. The middle class built this country. And unions build the middle class. And that""s why I""m calling on Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act – the PRO Act — and send it to my desk to support the right to unionize. By the way – let""s also pass the $15 minimum wage. No one should work 40 hours a week and still live below the poverty line. And we need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. Let""s get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk for equal pay. It""s long past time. Finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in non-defense research and development on record. We will see more technological change in the next 10 years – than we saw in the last 50 years. And we""re falling behind in that competition. Decades ago we used to invest 2% of our GDP on research and development. Today, we spend less than 1%. China and other countries are closing in fast. We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, and clean energy. The Defense Department has an agency called DARPA – the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency – that""s there to develop breakthroughs to enhance our national security – which led to the internet and GPS and so much more. The National Institutes of Health, the NIH – should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for health. To develop breakthroughs – to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer""s, diabetes, and cancer. This is personal to so many of us. I can think of no more worthy investment. And I know of nothing that is more bipartisan. Let""s end cancer as we know it. It""s within our power. Investments in jobs and infrastructure like the ones we""re talking about have often had bipartisan support. Vice President Harris and I meet regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the American Jobs Plan. And I applaud a group of Republican Senators who just put forward their proposal. So, let""s get to work. We welcome ideas. But, the rest of the world isn""t waiting for us. Doing nothing is not an option. We can""t be so busy competing with each other that we forget the competition is with the rest of the world to win the 21st Century. To win that competition for the future, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families – in our children. That""s why I""m introducing the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families today. First, access to a good education. When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated and best-prepared nation in the world. But the world is catching up. They are not waiting. 12 years is no longer enough today to compete in the 21st Century. That""s why the American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America – starting as early as we can. We add two years of universal high-quality pre-school for every 3- and 4- year-old in America. The research shows that when a young child goes to school—not day care—they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go on to college. And then we add two years of free community college. And we will increase Pell Grants and investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal colleges, and minority-serving institutions. Jill is a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady. She has long said any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us – and she""ll be leading this effort. Second, the American Families plan will provide access to quality, affordable child care. We guarantee that low- to middle-income families will pay no more than 7% of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5. The most hard-pressed working families won""t have to spend a dime. Third, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and a loved one – a parent, spouse, or child. And fourth, the American Families Plan puts money directly into the pockets of millions of families. In March we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family. Up to a $3,000 Child Tax Credit for children over 6 — and $3,600 for children under 6. With two parents, two kids, that""s up to $7,200 in your pocket to help take care of your family. This will help more than 65 million children and help cut child poverty in half this year. Together, let""s extend the Child Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025. The American Rescue Plan lowered health care premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Let""s make that provision permanent so their premiums don""t go back up. In addition to my Families Plan, I will work with Congress to address – this year – other critical priorities for America""s families. The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans –protecting people with pre-existing conditions, protecting women""s health. And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly it is needed. Let""s lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care Act, and let""s lower prescription drug costs. We all know how outrageously expensive they are. In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world right here in America – nearly three times as much as other countries. We can change that. Let""s do what we""ve always talked about. Let""s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower prices for prescription drugs. That won""t just help people on Medicare – it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone. The money we save can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act – expand Medicare coverage and benefits – without costing taxpayers one additional penny. We""ve talked about it long enough – Democrats and Republicans. Let""s get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Health care should be a right, not a privilege in America. So how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plans? I""ve made clear that we can do it without increasing deficits. Let""s start with what I will not do. I will not impose any tax increases on people making less than $400,000 a year. It""s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1% of Americans to pay their fair share. Just pay their fair share. A recent study shows that 55 of the nation""s biggest corporations paid zero in federal income tax last year. No federal taxes on more than $40 billion in profits. A lot of companies evade taxes through tax havens from Switzerland to Bermuda to the Cayman Islands. And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions that allow for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. That""s not right. We""re going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share – and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from. And, we""re going to reward work, not wealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans – those making $400,000 or more – back up to 39.6%. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans – those making $400,000 or more – back up to 39.6%. That""s where it was when George W. Bush became president. We""re going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than $1 million a year pay a lower rate on their capital gains than working Americans pay on their work. This will only affect three tenths of 1% of all Americans. And the IRS will crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes. That""s estimated to be billions of dollars. Look, I""m not out to punish anyone. But I will not add to the tax burden of the middle class of this country. They""re already paying enough. What I""ve proposed is fair. It""s fiscally responsible. It raises the revenue to pay for the plans I""ve proposed that will create millions of jobs and grow the economy. When you hear someone say that they don""t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1% and on corporate America – ask them: whose taxes are you going to raise instead, and whose are you going to cut? Look at the big tax cut in 2017. It was supposed to pay for itself and generate vast economic growth. Instead it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top. Instead of using the tax savings to raise wages and invest in research and development – it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history. According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what their average workers make. The pandemic has only made things worse. 20 million Americans lost their jobs in the pandemic – working- and middle-class Americans. At the same time, the roughly 650 Billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 Trillion. Let me say that again. Just 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 Trillion during this pandemic. They are now worth more than $4 Trillion. My fellow Americans, trickle-down economics has never worked. It""s time to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle-out. A broad consensus of economists – left, right, center – agree that what I""m proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest value investments we can make as a nation. I""ve often said that our greatest strength is the power of our example – not just the example of our power. And in my conversations with world leaders – many I""ve known for a long time – the comment I hear most often is: we see that America is back – but for how long? My fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we are back, but that we are here to stay. And that we aren""t going it alone – we""re going to be leading with our allies. No one nation can deal with all the crises of our time alone – from terrorism to nuclear proliferation to mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change – and as we""re experiencing now, pandemics. There""s no wall high enough to keep any virus away. As our own vaccine supply grows to meet our needs – and we are meeting them – we will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries – just as America was the arsenal of democracy in World War 2. The climate crisis is not our fight alone, either. It""s a global fight. The United States accounts for less than 15% of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for 85%. That""s why – I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on my first day in office. And I kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America, with all of the major economies of the world – from China and Russia to India and the European Union in my first 100 days. I wanted the world to see that there is consensus that we are at an inflection point in history. And the consensus is if we act, we can save the planet – and we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living for everyone in the world. The investments I""ve proposed tonight also advance a foreign policy that benefits the middle class. That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China. In my discussion with President Xi, I told him that we welcome the competition – and that we are not looking for conflict. But I made absolutely clear that I will defend American interests across the board. America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and industries, like subsidies for state-owned enterprises and the theft of American technologies and intellectual property. I also told President Xi that we will maintain a strong military presence in the Indo—Pacific just as we do with NATO in Europe – not to start conflict – but to prevent conflict. And, I told him what I""ve said to many world leaders – that America won""t back away from our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms. No responsible American president can remain silent when basic human rights are violated. A president has to represent the essence of our country. America is an idea – unique in the world. We are all created equal. It""s who we are. We cannot walk away from that principle. With regard to Russia, I made very clear to President Putin that while we don""t seek escalation, their actions have consequences. I responded in a direct and proportionate way to Russia""s interference in our elections and cyber— attacks on our government and businesses – and they did both of those things and I did respond. But we can also cooperate when it""s in our mutual interests. As we did when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms – and as we""re working to do on the climate crisis. On Iran and North Korea""s nuclear programs that present a serious threat to America""s security and world security – we will be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through diplomacy and stern deterrence. And American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan. We have the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. And I""m the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have had a child serving in a warzone. Today we have service members serving in the same war as their parents once did. We have service members in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11. War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multi—generational undertaking of nation—building. We went to Afghanistan to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11. We delivered justice to Osama Bin Laden and we degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan. After 20 years of American valor and sacrifice, it""s time to bring our troops home. Even as we do, we will maintain an over—the—horizon capability to suppress future threats to the homeland. But make no mistake – the terrorist threat has evolved beyond Afghanistan since 2001 and we will remain vigilant against threats to the United States, wherever they come from. Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and other places in Africa and the Middle East and beyond. And, we won""t ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined – the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today is from white supremacist terrorism. And my fellow Americans, we must come together to heal the soul of this nation. It was nearly a year ago before her father""s funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd""s young daughter. As I knelt down to talk to her so we could talk eye—to—eye, she said to me, ""Daddy changed the world."" After the conviction of George Floyd""s murderer, we can see how right she was – if we have the courage to act. We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America. Now is our opportunity to make real progress. Most men and women in uniform wear their badge and serve their communities honorably. I know them. I know they want to help meet this moment as well. My fellow Americans, we have to come together. To rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve. To root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system. And to enact police reform in George Floyd""s name that passed the House already. I know the Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in productive discussions with Democrats. We need to work together to find a consensus. Let""s get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd""s death. The country supports this reform. Congress should act. We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe toward justice. Real justice. And with the plans I outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues American life in many other ways. A chance to deliver real equity. Good jobs and good schools. Affordable housing. Clean air and clean water. Being able to generate wealth and pass it down through generations. Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans – Black, white, Latino, Asian American, Native American. I also want to thank the Senate for voting 94—1 to pass the COVID—19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from the vicious hate crimes we""ve seen this past year – and for too long. I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk as soon as possible. I also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect the rights of LGBTQ Americans. To all the transgender Americans watching at home – especially the young people who are so brave – I want you to know that your president has your back. And another thing. Let""s reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law in this country for 27 years since I first wrote it. It will close the so—called ""boyfriend"" loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. It""s estimated that more than 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner – every month in America. Pass it and save lives. And I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is an epidemic in America. Our flag at the White House was still flying at half—staff for the 8 victims of the mass shooting in Georgia, when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado. In the week between those mass shootings, more than 250 other Americans were shot dead. 250 shot dead. I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue. In the 1990s, we passed universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons and high—capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. But in the early 2000""s, that law expired and we""ve seen the daily bloodshed since. More than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know – the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence – I laid out several steps the Department of Justice is taking to end this epidemic. One of them is banning so—called ""ghost guns."" They are homemade guns built from a kit that includes the directions on how to finish the firearm. The parts have no serial numbers, so when they show up at a crime scene, they can't be traced. The buyers of ghost gun kits aren't required to pass a background check. Anyone from a criminal to a terrorist could buy this kit and, in as little as 30 minutes, put together a lethal weapon. But not anymore. I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence. But it""s time for Congress to act as well. We need more Senate Republicans to join with the overwhelming majority of their Democratic colleagues, and close loopholes and require background checks to purchase a gun. And we need a ban on assault weapons and high—capacity magazines again. Don""t tell me it can""t be done. We""ve done it before … and it worked. Talk to most responsible gun owners, most hunters – they""ll tell you there""s no possible justification for having 100 rounds – 100 bullets – in a weapon. They will tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun, but who shouldn""t be able to. These kinds of reasonable reforms have the overwhelming support of the American people – including many gun owners. The country supports reform, and the Congress should act. This shouldn""t be a Red vs. Blue issue. It""s an American issue. And here""s what else we can do. Immigration has always been essential to America. Let""s end our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform and done nothing about it. It""s time to fix it. On day one of my Presidency, I kept my commitment and I sent a comprehensive immigration bill to Congress. If you believe we need a secure border – pass it. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship – pass it. If you actually want to solve the problem – I have sent you a bill, now pass it. We also have to get at the root of the problem of why people are fleeing to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. The violence. The corruption. The gangs. The political instability. Hunger. Hurricanes. Earthquakes. When I was Vice President, I focused on providing the help needed to address these root causes of migration. It helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. Our plan worked. But the last administration shut it down. I""m restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic efforts. I have absolute confidence she will get the job done. Now, if Congress won""t pass my plan – let""s at least pass what we agree on. Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for the Dreamers – the young people who have only known America as their home. And, permanent protections for immigrants on temporary protected status who come from countries beset by man—made and natural made violence and disaster. As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables. Immigrants have done so much for America during the pandemic – as they have throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. Congress should act. And if we are to truly restore the soul of America – we need to protect the sacred right to vote. More people voted in the last presidential election than ever before in our history – in the middle of one of the worst pandemics ever. That should be celebrated. Instead it""s being attacked. Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send them to my desk right away. The country supports it. Congress should act. As we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol—desecrating our democracy—remain vivid in our minds. Lives were put at risk. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned. The insurrection was an existential crisis—a test of whether our democracy could survive. It did. But the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy  will long endure is both ancient and urgent. As old as our Republic. Still vital today. Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us – created equal in the image of God – have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility? Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people? Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have pulled us apart? America""s adversaries – the autocrats of the world – are betting it can""t. They believe we are too full of anger and division and rage. They look at the images of the mob that assaulted this Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. They are wrong. And we have to prove them wrong. We have to prove democracy still works. That our government still works – and can deliver for the people. In our first 100 Days together, we have acted to restore the people""s faith in our democracy to deliver. We""re vaccinating the nation. We""re creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. We""re delivering real results people can see and feel in their own lives. Opening the doors of opportunity. Guaranteeing fairness and justice. That""s the essence of America. That""s democracy in action. Our Constitution opens with the words, ""We the People"". It""s time we remembered that We the People are the government. You and I. Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force we have no control over. It""s us. It""s ""We the people."" In another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us—In America: we do our part. That""s all I""m asking. That we all do our part. And if we do, then we will meet the central challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. The autocrats will not win the future. America will. The future will belong to America. I stand here tonight before you in a new and vital hour in the life of our democracy and our nation. And I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or more optimistic about America. We have stared into an abyss of insurrection and autocracy — of pandemic and pain — and ""We the People"" did not flinch. At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail. We came together. United. With light and hope, we summoned new strength and new resolve. To position us to win the competition for the 21st Century. On our way forward to a Union more perfect. More prosperous. More just. As one people. One nation. One America. It""s never been a good bet to bet against America. And it still isn""t. We are the United States of America. There is nothing – nothing – beyond our capacity – nothing we can""t do – if we do it together. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops."
usa_today|"President Joe Biden's first joint address to Congress took place April 28, a speech that was fact-checked during and after by an array of media organizations. But some on social media ran with a different narrative, claiming the Washington Post was halting its scrutiny of the nation's leader. An April 28 Facebook post reads, ""Washington Post ends fact checking for Biden for the remainder of his presidency,"" across an image of Biden. The post has more than 700 shares. USA TODAY reached out to the user for further comment. More:Fact check: Image falsely claims to show Harris and Pelosi sleeping during Biden's speech to Congress This is a misinterpretation of a recent Post announcement. Biden will not get away from the Post's Pinocchio's, but the fact checks will not be compiled in a database. ""Here's the Biden database -- which we do not plan to extend beyond 100 days. I have learned my lesson,"" reads an April 26 tweet by Glenn Kessler, editor and chief writer for the Post""s Fact Checker. The tweet came two days before Biden's address to Congress, so it is important to note that their team did fact check the speech. The Post said it analyzed ""every speech, interview, tweet or public statement made by the president"" through April 26. Any statement that would receive at least Two Pinocchios – or ""half true"" – was added to the database. The Post will continue to fact-check the president, but no database will be maintained, Kessler said on Twitter. The newspaper took on the task of maintaining a database during the previous presidency in response to unique circumstances. It started as a 100-day project and then turned into a companion project for the current president so a comparison could be made, Shani George, vice president of communications for the Washington Post, told USA TODAY in a statement. ""We are continuing our practice of rigorous, routine fact-checking, which has already identified dozens of false and misleading statements by Biden, and will continue to hold the president accountable for his words,"" George said. In the thread, Kessler also detailed the extensive labor it took to maintain the database under former President Donald Trump. ""Maintaining the Trump database over four years required about 400 additional 8-hour days over four years beyond our regular jobs for three people,"" he wrote. The Fact Checker""s database of President Trump included 30,573 false and misleading claims, of which 8,859 were made in the last 100 days before the 2020 presidential election. ""Trump at 500 claims/100 days was manageable; 8,000+ was not,"" Kessler wrote. More:Fact check: Kamala Harris didn't say Joe Biden would 'do whatever the Chinese tell you' at debate The claim that the the Post will stop fact-checking Biden for the remainder of his presidency is FALSE, based on our research. Kessler said the team will continue fact-checking President Biden, but no database will be kept given the  extensive labor required. The Post team has already published Biden checks after announcing the end of the database."
usa_today|"Wednesday night will mark the first time President Joe Biden speaks in front of both houses of Congress as he approaches his 100th day in office. While Biden's speech on the Congress floor will seem like the State of the Union, it actually is not. The practice of addressing a joint session of Congress comes straight from Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution, which states the president, ""shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient."" The annual address is typically delivered by the president in late January or early February, with the last one given by former President Donald Trump on Feb. 4, 2020. Since the inauguration of former President Ronald Reagan in 1981, presidents have not delivered the State of the Union the year they left office or were inaugurated, primarily because a president can't really speak about the state of the country just a few weeks in office. Fact check:No deadline is in place for delivering State of the Union At 100 days (and after a lifetime in politics):The surprising presidency of Joe Biden That same year is when the new tradition began where the new president addressed Congress without the State of the Union title, like Trump's ""Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress"" in 2017. Biden's address comes a few months into his term due to COVID-19 precautions, and only after he accepted an invitation from Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi on April 13. Wednesday's speech allows Biden to speak on the progress of his administration in his first nearly 100 days in office. There will be other differences; only a few special guests are invited to the address and some members of Congress and the Supreme Court will not be present or seated in the House gallery due to social distancing guidelines. The event will also be designated as a National Special Security Event in wake of the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6. Follow Jordan Mendoza on Twitter: @jord_mendoza."
usa_today|"Are the Bidens a lot larger than the Carters? Social media sure thinks so after a photo of President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden with former President Jimmy Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter circulated online. The Bidens made a stop in Plains, Georgia, last Thursday to visit the 39th president and his wife after a drive-in rally in Atlanta to mark Joe Biden's first 100 days in office. The Carter Center, a nonprofit started by the Carters with Emory University, tweeted the photo of the visit on Monday, and some Twitter users began to question if the photo was distorted due to everything appearing small except for the Bidens. Others chopped it up to the use of a wide-angle lens. The use of the wide-angle lens could have helped create an illusion, according to camera company Canon. ""On images shot with a wide-angle lens, perspective appears to be exaggerated: Nearby objects may look much bigger (and hence nearer) than they really are, and faraway objects look even smaller and further away,"" the Canon website said.
